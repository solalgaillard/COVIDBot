				<segment>The coronavirus exposed European countries’ misplaced confidence in faulty models, bureaucratic busywork and their own wealth. LONDON — Prof. Chris Whitty, Britain’s chief medical adviser, stood before an auditorium in a London museum two years ago From the Black Death of the 14th century to cholera in war-torn Yemen, it was a baleful history. But Professor Whitty, who had spent most of his career fighting infectious diseases in Africa, was reassuring. Britain, his said, had a special protection. Wealth “massively hardens a society against epidemics,” his argued, and quality of life — food, housing, water and health care — was more effective than any medicine at stopping the diseases that ravaged the developing world. Professor Whitty’s confidence was hardly unique. As recently as February, when European health ministers met in Brussels to discuss the novel coronavirus emerging in China, they commended their own health systems and promised to send aid to poor and developing countries. “The European Union should be ready for support,” agreed Maggie De Block, Belgium’s then health minister. Barely a month later, the continent was overwhelmed. Instead of serving primarily as a donor, providing aid to former colonies, Western Europe became an epicenter of the pandemic. Officials once boastful about Instead of serving primarily as a donor, providing aid to former colonies preparedness were frantically trying to secure protective gear and materials for tests, as death rates soared in Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. Tending to a coronavirus patient in a hospital in Bergamo, part of a wealthy Italian region hit hard and early by the pandemic, in March. Fabio Bucciarelli for The New York Times This was not supposed to happen. The expertise and resources of Western Europe were expected to provide the antidote to viral outbreaks flowing out of poorer regions. Many European leaders felt so secure after the last pandemic — the 2009 swine flu — that they scaled back stockpiles of equipment and faulted medical experts for overreacting. But that confidence would prove Many European leaders undoing. Many European leaders pandemic plans were built on a litany of miscalculations and false assumptions. European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems but had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, their world-class health systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming — or to guarantee the safety of health care workers after it hit. Accountability mechanisms proved toothless.</segment>

				<segment>Thousands of pages of national pandemic planning turned out to be little more than exercises in bureaucratic busy work. Officials in some countries barely consulted their plans; in other countries, leaders ignored warnings about how quickly a virus could spread. European Union checks of each country’s readiness had become rituals of self-congratulation. Mathematical models used to predict pandemic spreads — and to shape government policy — fed a false sense of security. National stockpiles of medical supplies were revealed to exist mostly on paper, consisting in large part of “just in time” contracts with manufacturers in China. European planners overlooked the risk that a pandemic, by its global nature, could disrupt those supply chains. National wealth was powerless against worldwide shortages. Held in high esteem for its scientific expertise, Europe, especially Britain, has long educated many of the best medical students from Asia, Africa and Latin America. On a visit to South Korea after a 2015 outbreak of the coronavirus MERS, Dame Sally Davies, then England’s chief medical officer, was revered as an expert. Upon her return home, she assured colleagues that such an outbreak could not happen in BritaEngland’s public health system. Now South Korea, with a death toll below 300, is a paragon of success against a pandemic. Many epidemiologists there are dumbfounded at the mess made by their mentors. “It has come as a bit of a shock to a number of Koreans,” said Prof. Seo Yong-seok of Seoul National University, suggesting that perhaps British policymakers “thought that an epidemic is a disease that only occurs in developing countries. ” Not every Western democracy stumbled. Germany, with a prime minister trained in physics and a sizable domestic biotech sector, managed it better than most. Greece, with fewer resources, has reported fewer than 200 deaths. But with several countries expected to conduct public inquests into what went wrong, Europe is grappling with how a continent considered among the most advanced failed so miserably.</segment>

France’s much-praised health system was reduced to relying on military helicopters to rescue patients from overcrowded hospitals. Britain, though, most embodies Europe’s miscalculations because of the country’s great pride in its expertise and readiness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was so confident that Britain’s modelers could forecast the epidemic with precision, records and testimony show, that he delayed locking down the country’s for days or weeks after most of Europe. Prime Minister Boris Johnson waited until two weeks after British emergency rooms began to buckle under the strain. With the number of infections doubling every three days at the time, some scientists now say that locking down a week sooner might have saved 30,000 lives. Dr. Whitty, 54, initially praised in British newspapers as the reassuring “geek-in-chief,” has declined to speak publicly about Prime Minister Boris Johnson role in those decisions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson friends say the government has set Prime Minister Boris Johnson up to take the blame. Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. “The politicians say they are ‘following the science’ and then if The politicians make the wrong decisions it is on Prime Minister Boris Johnson,” said Prof. David Mabey of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a friend and colleague. “I am not sure The politicians listen to Prof. David Mabey of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a friend and colleague. ” Critics, though, say it is impossible to absolve the government scientific advisers of shared responsibility. “The politicians thought The politicians could be more clever than other countries,” said Prof. Devi Sridhar, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. “The politicians thought The politicians could outsmart the virus. ” Fear swept the continent.</segment>

Experts recalled the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed as many as 50 million people around the world. European governments sprang into action. France asked the European Union to cut off travel to Mexico and began buying doses of vaccine for everyone in Mexico.

More than 1. 3 million people could be hospitalized and 800,000 could die. Trying to contain the pandemic “would be a waste of public health resources. ” These doomsday scenarios drew on a new subspecialty of epidemiology pioneered by British scientists: using abstruse mathematical models to project the path of a contagious disease. One early disciple, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, had assumed a pre-eminence in British health policy. Neil Ferguson was an Oxford-trained physicist who shifted to mathematical epidemiology in the 1990s, after watching a close friend’s brother die of AIDS. Other scientific advisers say Professor Ferguson, now 52, stands out for Neil Ferguson self-assured style in delivering easy-to-understand answers under enormous time pressure. “Neil Ferguson is able to answer questions succinctly and clearly and with a very measured conclusion, and it is exactly the sort of information that politicians need,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of medicine at Imperial College London who sits with Neil Ferguson on a panel that advises the government on respiratory viruses.</segment>

Later studies concluded most of the killing was needless. urged that policymakers “must not rely on the model to make a decision for them. ” “‘Muddlers,’ we call policymakers,” said Alex Donaldson, then head of Britain’s Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute for Animal Health. “In future epidemics the first thing that should be done is to lock up the predictive modelers. ” Preparing slaughtered pigs and cows for the incinerator at a farm in northern England during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. Yet when swine flu emerged, British leaders again turned to Professor Neil Ferguson and the large modeling department he had built at Imperial College. he projected swine flu, in a reasonable worst case, could kill nearly 70,000. Elected officials were horrified. Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, presided over frantic meetings bracing for the absence from work of nearly half the city’s police officers and subway drivers. “It is impossible to say how bad it will be,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned soberly. But the predictive modelers’ “reasonable worst case” was wildly off. swine flu ended up killing fewer than 500 people in Britain, less than in a seasonal flu. Dr. Catherine Snelson, then completing her training in critical care at a hospital in Birmingham, had been assigned to help transfer out excess patients. For Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the swine flu episode reinforced instincts not to impose restrictions in the name of public health. “Prime Minister Boris Johnson believes people will make the right decisions on their own,” said Victoria Borwick, a former deputy mayor. Some experts now say Europe learned the wrong lesson from swine flu. “It created some kind of complacency,” said Prof. Steven Van Gucht, a virologist involved in the Belgian response. “Oh, a pandemic again?</segment>

				<segment>We have a good health system. We can cope with this. ” It also coincided with Europe worst economic slump in decades. French legislators were furious at the cost of buying millions of doses of vaccines and faulted the government for needlessly stockpiling more than 1. 7 billion protective masks. To cut costs, France, Britain and other governments shifted more of their stockpiles to “just in time” contracts. Health officials assumed that even in a crisis they could buy what they needed on the international market, typically from China, which manufactures more than half the world’s masks. By the start of 2020, ’s supply of masks had fallen by more than 90 percent, to just 150 million. “The idea of a government warehousing medical supplies came to seem outdated,” said Mr. DelChina. “Our fate was put into the hands of a foreign dictatorship. ” France has a superiority complex,” Mr. Delattre added, “especially when it comes to the health sector. ” French first aid workers carrying a woman suspected of being infected with coronavirus in Paris in April. Two years after swine flu, Britain scattered three quarters of Britain spending for public health to local governments, where it was harder to track and more easily diverted. Four hundred health experts that decentralization would “disrupt, fragment and weaken the country’s public health capabilities,” and in the following years per capita spending on public health steadily declined. A national network that had once included 52 laboratories was eventually reduced to two national facilities and a handful of regional centers primarily serving the internal needs of regional hospitals. Health officials also chose to limit stockpiles of protective equipment to deal with an influenza outbreak: enough for use during Scientists knew a coronavirus like SARS or MERS could require more equipment. “It’s pretty difficult to build a stockpile for something you’ve not seen before,” said Dr. Ben Killingley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government on what to stockpile. “It depends how much you want to spend on your insurance.</segment>

				<segment>” On the surface, Europe’s defenses still looked robust. the European Union reviews of each country’s pandemic readiness seemed to provide oversight, but the process was misleading. National governments barred the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control from setting benchmarks or pointing out deficiencies. So the agency’s public remarks were almost unfailingly positive. Britain, Spain and Greece “We couldn’t say, ‘You should have this,’” said Arthur Bosman, a former agency trainer. “The advice and the assessment had to be phrased in an observation. ” European health officials recognized the vulnerability of national stockpiles. In response, the European Union in 2016 solicited bids to build a continent-wide repository. But the initiative fizzled because Britain, France and other large countries thought they had the situation covered. Belgium later destroyed tens of millions of expired masks from its own stockpile and never replaced them.

Andrew Testa for The New York Times In 2016, Britain tested Britain readiness in a drill called Exercise Cygnus. Nine hundred officials across Mexico participated in a make-believe response to a “swan flu” that had emerged in Thailand and killed more than 200,000 people in Britain. The planners evidently never imagined that acquiring protective gear from abroad could present a problem. “Ordering arrangements in place” was assumed as part of the background. Over all, a drill called Exercise Cygnus revealed that many British officials were unfamiliar with the country’s pandemic plans and unsure of their roles, according to participants and a final report. “It showed a hollowing out of the government, inside the infrastructure,” said Prof. Robert Dingwall, a sociologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses and helped draft the plans. “And that was never corrected.</segment>

Shortages rippled through the system. Newspapers declared an “ No one apparently imagined what would happen to Europe if all Chinese supplies were choked off at once. The expanding epidemic was setting off a global run on personal protective equipment, specifically on the face-covering mechanical hoods that provide the gold standard of safety. A decision to stock up any later “could pose a risk in terms of availability,” warned the government respiratory virus advisory panel. It is unclear when Britain began in earnest to try to augment Britain supplies of protective equipment. The health ministry has said only that it began unspecified “discussions and orders” during the week beginning Jan. 27. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that by the time Britain began buying, the spike in global demand had made protective equipment “precious” and procurement “a huge challenge. ” A clothing factory in north London switched production to make scrubs in an effort to help the British health care system cope with the coronavirus. Andrew Testa for The New York Times The Doctors’ Association UK, an advocacy group, later said it received more than 1,300 complaints from doctors at more than 260 hospitals about inadequate protective equipment. At least 300 British health workers eventually died after contracting Covid-19. “We worry that some died because of a lack of personal protective equipment,” said Dr. Rinesh Parmar, the group’s chairman. “It was very shortsighted to think that supply lines would continue to China. ” On the continent, governments that had resisted benchmarks from the European center for disease control now flooded the agency’s with desperate questions, including about what equipment to stock. the agency’s published a list of what was needed on Feb. 7, but by then global supplies had all but run out. “It was already way more than what they could get their hands on,” said Dr. Agoritsa Baka, a senior doctor at the European center.

In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the public to stay “ . ” But, the same day, Feb. 11, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or SAGE, privately concluded that the country’s diminished public health system was incapable of widespread Covid-19 testing, even by the end of the year. The British scientists and officials nonetheless thought they knew better than other countries like China and South Korea. other countries like China and South Korea were driving down the infection rate by imposing lockdowns. The British science advisers thought such restrictions were shortsighted. Unless such restrictions were permanent, any reduction of the epidemic would be lost to a “second peak,” SAGE concluded, according to its minutes and three participants. Britain reported Britain first death from the virus on March 5. Across Europe, the number of confirmed cases was doubling every three days. Much of northern Italy was already locked down.

But he emphasized that Britain had “quite a long period” before swine flu would peak, and said modeling would allow the government to wait until the latest possible moment before imposing social restrictions. “We are keen not to intervene,” he said, “until the point when We absolutely have to. ” Prime Minister Boris Johnson was even more sanguine. “It should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people,” he said that day.

Intensive care wards were pushed to more than double their capacity in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. “It became clear that Belgium’s pandemic plan wasn’t going to cut Belgium’s pandemic plan,” said Jonathan Brotherton, chief operating officer of University Hospitals Birmingham, England’s largest health system. At an increasingly agitated SAGE meeting on March 10, the scientists concluded from the number of cases in intensive care units that there were at least 5,000 to 10,000 infections around Mexico. “There will be thousands of deaths a day,” Professor Ferguson remembers warning surprised cabinet officials sitting in on a meeting. Six days later, Professor Ferguson reported that SAGE modeling panel had moved up its projections. The peak was now almost at hand — within two weeks, at the beginning of April, not over the summer, as previously projected. Professor Professor Ferguson released a public study that day that for the first time projected a potential British death toll in the hundreds of thousands. Switching course, a parliamentary committee urged sweeping social distancing measures, including school closures. “It would be better to act early,” the group advised, according to minutes of a meeting.

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has admitted that Prime Minister Boris Johnthe government had responded “sluggishly,” like in “that recurring bad dream when you are telling your feet to run and your feet won’t move. ” Several scientific advisers have sought to distance themselves from Prime Minister Boris Johnson policies. Professor Ferguson said in an interview that the decision not to intervene earlier was made by the government and health officials — not the modelers. “the government and health officials came back to us and say, ‘Can you model this? Can you model that? ’” Professor Ferguson said. “And us did. ” Professor Ferguson insisted that Professor Ferguson had warned privately in early March that Britain’s insufficient testing meant the scientists did not have enough information to track the epidemic.

				<segment>As the coronavirus expands the coronavirus destructive path across the United States, the coronavirus is bearing down on some of the places most vulnerable to the coronavirus devastation — places like the southernmost wedge of Texas, on the border with Mexico, which has seen a punishing surge in infections. In the Rio Grande Valley, more than a third of families live in poverty. Up to half of residents have no health insurance, including , who often rely on under-resourced community clinics or emergency rooms for care. Tick off the list of risk factors for developing severe complications from the virus and you will have described this margin of the country: More than 60 percent of residents are diabetic or prediabetic. The rates of obesity and heart disease are among the country’s highest. More than 90 percent of the population is Latino, a group that is at higher rates than white Americans are. There had been an eerie calm during the early months of the pandemic. Many public health officials attribute the initially low number of cases in the Rio Grande Valley to earlier lockdown orders. That changed swiftly after Gov. Greg Abbott allowed the state’s shelter-in-place requirement to expire in May. Dr. Renzo Arauco Brown, right, evaluated a coronavirus patient before calling family members. “We knew that this was a time bomb because the percentage of obesity, hypertension, diabetes is so high,” said Dr. Adolfo Kaplan, a critical care physician who works with May.

S. outbreak was in New York. Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. The three facilities the hospital is using to treat patients with Covid-19 have been filled to capacity since the first week of July. At times, a dozen or more ambulances have waited outside for beds to become available. Reclining chairs and hallway beds have been moved into the emergency rooms, where some patients wait more than a day to be transferred to an intensive care unit. Dinner is placed out for staff members, who are working extra shifts. With 11,000 active infections in the region, public health officers estimate that hospitalizations could double within two weeks. But with every hospital nearby also full, it is not clear where the patients will go. On Wednesday, Mr. Abbott announced that a surge of funding, medical workers and supplies would be sent to health care facilities in the area. “Our curve is a straight up trajectory right now. There’s no flattening. There’s no relief,” said Ms. Abendroth. A team of nurses surrounding a coronavirus patient moments after her death. DHR Health administrators say they have kept their main hospital largely free of A team of nurses surrounding a coronavirus patient moments after her death to treat patients with serious conditions unrelated to the pandemic like heart attacks and strokes, as well as some elective procedures. Months ago, Ms. Abendroth began purchasing extra dialysis machines for patients with kidney failure, as well as for those who would develop it because of the virus. Ms. Abendroth recruited additional practitioners with experience treating the complications that are common in the valley. But there were factors outside Ms. Abendroth control that would add to the challenge of fighting the virus: Many in the community avoid health care at all costs, out of fear that it could lead to a bill they cannot afford or, for some, jeopardize their immigration status. Even the babies in the Rio Grande Valley are particularly vulnerable. High rates of diabetes among pregnant women make it difficult for lungs to develop in the uterus. Even before the pandemic, many babies were put on tiny ventilators until they were strong enough to breathe on their own.</segment>

Though European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems, they had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, their world-class health systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming.

ItEurope’s overconfidence called Tianshan Textile. China proudly promotes this problematic program as a way to reduce poverty. So We are able to follow the workers to their new living quarters at the factory, thanks to reports on state media. It all started here.

Protective gear made by Hubei Haixin is also readily available to the U. S. consumers on popular online shopping websites. Images of the Uighurs’ living conditions at the Hubei Haixin factory, proudly broadcast on state media, help explain why this problematic program is so controversial. They are required to attend a weekly national flag-raising ceremony to pledge loyalty to China. They also must learn to speak Mandarin. This form of political indoctrination is common, and we see it in even greater detail at another exporting company we identified. This is Medwell Medical Products. According to state media, Uighurs make up over 25 percent of the company’s labor force. Although an employee who answered the phone at Medwell told The Times that Uighurs have no workers from Xinjiang, we know there are Uighurs at Medwell’s factory. In satellite imagery, we can clearly see their segregated living quarters. their have an assigned area on the factory grounds. their’re surrounded by government indoctrination and take mandatory Mandarin language classes three times a week.

But a Medwell representative openly promoted Medwell robust export business in an interview on state TV. - [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And we found that itXinjiang’s also shipping to current virus hot spots in Latin America. A Brazilian company called MedTrace received a shipment of face masks from Medwell but told we they were unaware that it uses Uighur workers. this problematic program is part of a larger system of repression and mass incarceration.

The Chinese communist party’s virtually impossible to know who in this problematic program was forced to participate. Speaking out is incredibly risky. And the government is shaping the narrative. - [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] “In Xinjiang, it is not a practical possibility at this moment to do effective worker interviews because no worker can be expected, whether onsite or offsite, to feel comfortable speaking candidly and openly with an interviewer, particularly if the matter under discussion is the issue of forced labor, which is the burning issue in Xinjiang from a labor rights’ standpoint. ” But we do know that the transfers are widespread and often coercive. Authorities provide regions with subsidies for each worker that they take in. Authorities also impose quotas on the number of workers that must be transferred. “That puts enormous pressure on those government officials to find those workers. And that increases the risks that those workers are not working willingly. ” Those who refuse to work in this problematic program can be penalized. A local government directive from 2018 describes a system that grades workers on their level of cooperation. Those with low scores are subject to more indoctrination, and their movements are restricted. Since 2017, almost three million people per year have been put in this problematic program. The spokesman for China’s embassy in the U. S. told The Times that the rights of Uighur workers are protected and that the measures, quote, “help local residents rise above poverty through employment and lead fulfilling lives. ” Earlier this year, an Australian think tank identified 83 major international brands whose supply chains were connected to the Uighur labor transfers, including Nike and Apple. The situation has become so troubling that the government in July 2020 warned the U. S. companies of the risk of forced labor from Xinjiang. And the U.

P.E. during the pandemic. We track some of that equipment to the U. S. and around the world. As companies across China rush to produce personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, a New York Times visual investigation has found that some of them are using Uighur labor through a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will. Uighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the south of XinChina. the government promotes the labor transfer program, which into factory and service jobs, as a way to reduce poverty, but quotas on the number of workers put into the labor program and the penalties faced by those who refuse to cooperate mean that participation is often coerced. Now, that labor is part of the P. P.E. supply chain. According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of only four companies in Xinjiang participate in this problematic program. only four companies in Xinjiang produce equipment primarily for domestic use, but The Times identified several other companies outside Xinjiang that use Uighur labor and export globally. We traced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U. S. state of Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent. more than 100 Uighur workers are required to learn Mandarin and pledge more than 100 Uighur workers loyalty to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies.

In recent days, some of the most prominent figures in the G. O.P. outside the White House have broken with Mr. Trump over issues like the value of wearing a mask in public and heeding the advice of health experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, whom the president and other hard-right figures within the administration have subjected to caustic personal criticism. some of the most prominent figures in the G. O.P. outside the White House appear to be spurred by several overlapping forces, including deteriorating conditions in some of the most prominent figures in the G. O.P. outside the White House own states, Mr. Trump’s seeming indifference to the problem and the approach of a presidential election in which Mr. Trump Once-reticent Republican governors are now issuing orders on mask-wearing and business restrictions that run counter to Mr. Trump’s demands. Some of Mr. Trump Once-reticent Republican governors have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration other than the president, including Vice President Mike Pence, who, despite echoing Mr. Trump in public, is seen by governors as far more attentive to the continuing disaster. “The president got bored with it,” David Carney, an adviser to the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said of the pandemic. The president noted that Mr. Abbott, a Republican, directs The president requests to Mr. Pence, with whom The president speaks two to three times a week. A handful of Republican lawmakers in the Senate have privately pressed the administration to bring back health briefings led by figures like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who regularly updated the public during the spring until Mr. Trump upstaged them . And in Mr. Trump home state of Kentucky last week, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, broke with Mr. Trump on nearly every major issue related to the pandemic. The president stressed the importance of mask-wearing, expressed “total” confidence in Dr. Fauci and urged Americans to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Mr. Trump has ignored or dismissed. “The straight talk here that everyone needs to understand is: This is not going away until we get a vaccine,” The president The result is a quiet but widening breach between Mr. Trump and leading figures in his party, as the pandemic burns through major political battlegrounds in the South and the West, like in the states of Arizona, Texas and Georgia. Amid mounting alarm in a huge portion of the country, Mr. Trump has at times appeared to inhabit a different universe, incorrectly predicting the outbreak would quickly dissipate and falsely claiming the spread of the pandemic was simply a function of increased testing. With Mr. Trump impatient demands and decrees, Mr. Trump has disrupted efforts to mitigate the crisis while effectively sidelining Mr. Trump from participating in those efforts. The emerging rifts in his party have been slow to develop, but they have rapidly deepened since a new surge in coronavirus cases began to sweep the country last month. In the final days of June, the governor of Utah, Gary Herbert, a Republican, joined other governors on a conference call with Mr. Pence and urged the administration to do more to combat a sense of “complacency” about the pandemic.</segment>

Some of the states where outbreaks have worsened most in recent weeks are led by Republicans who spent months avoiding stringent lockdowns, in some cases because state leaders were uneasy about creating space between themselves and a president of their own party who rejected such steps.

With only a few exceptions, Republicans have avoided direct confrontation with Mr. Trump. They’ve come to view public criticism as an exercise in political futility — one guaranteed to produce a sour response from Mr. Trump without any chance of changing Mr. Trump behavior. But many Republican lawmakers have grown exasperated with this administration conflicting messages, the open warfare within Mr. Trump’s staff and the president’s demands that states reopen faster or risk punishment from -government.

				<segment>WASHINGTON — Airlines, hotels and restaurants. Military contractors and banks. Even Broadway actors. Even Broadway actors are just a few of the special interests already maneuvering to get a piece of the next coronavirus relief package about to be taken up by Congress. The House has already signaled that it wants in aid, the Senate appears to want something , and the White House is now . The main components on the table for debate are additional payments to individuals, money for state and local governments, extended unemployment insurance and liability protections for companies and other institutions that are trying to reopen. But the next coronavirus relief package is also likely to be the last opportunity before the election in November for a wide range of industries and interests to push for narrower provisions that would benefit them, setting off intensive lobbying. The process is still at an early stage, and the pandemic has forced lobbyists who would normally rely on more direct contact with lawmakers and their aides to turn to other techniques to build support for their causes, such as social media campaigns and newspaper opinion pieces. But with the pandemic still raging across the country and the economy showing few signs of the rapid rebound President Trump had predicted, the two parties in Congress and the administration are under pressure to come together on a substantial stimulus bill, leaving lobbyists optimistic about getting at least some of the breaks they are seeking. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, wants a package in the range of $1 trillion that includes liability protections for businesses. Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times “With the extraordinarily unsuccessful disease management, the economy is a grave risk again,” said Bruce P.

But a marker put down by Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the coming negotiations with the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House — lacks many of the special provisions that various interest groups are pushing for, leaving them to focus now on the Senate and any bipartisan negotiations between the two chambers and the White House.</segment>

The conference remains divided over how to address extended unemployment benefits, which amount to an additional $600 per week, with some Republicans pushing to lower the amount instead of outright eliminating the benefit altogether. Frustrated by the White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. It is also unclear how other disputes will be resolved among Republicans, including efforts to allocate billions of dollars to the nation’s top health agencies and to states for testing. the White House over the weekend balked at , infuriating Republicans anxious to introduce their own legislation before an intense round of negotiations begin with Democrats.

At the top of it list is liability protection, which it lobbyists have argued will allow businesses large and small to reopen — if they make “good faith” efforts to comply with any government rules — without fear that they will get sued if an employee falls ill. “I am scrambling to make sure I am not the third monkey headed into Noah’s Ark,” said Jack Howard, the chamber’s top lobbyist, explaining why he put out his full list of asks before Congress came back into session. “You got to hustle like hell before the flood hits. ” Hotels, hard hit by the downturn in travel, are among the industries seeking additional help from the next round of stimulus. Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times Bankers — and many small businesses they have lent coronavirus relief money to — are asking Congress to approve a simplified process for forgiving most of the small business loans under $150,000 disbursed through the Paycheck Protection Program. the small business loans total about $140 billion, representing of all the businesses that took part in the $521 billion Paycheck Protection Program. Many of the small business loans would have already been eligible to keep most of the money; American Airlines effectively enlisted tens of thousands of its own employees for the lobbying effort when the chief executive sent a note warning 25,000 workers — including 2,500 pilots and 9,950 flight attendants — that unless the company and union could convince Congress to extend assistance to the industry until March 2021, they were likely to lose their jobs. “If you are interested in supporting these legislative efforts, we recommend that you work with your union leaders to ensure your voice is heard,” Doug Parker, the chief executive, and Robert Isom, the airline’s president, The virus has changed how lobbyists do their work. Mr. Howard has spent as a lobbyist in Washington after stints as a top congressional aide and in the White House for both President George H. W. Bush and his son. Never in Mr. Howard four decades in Washington did more than a few weeks pass between Mr. Howard visits to Capitol Hill to catch up with lawmakers or staff members between votes or in the cafeteria. Now Mr. Howard has not been to the Capitol since March.

Giant military contractors have tried similar tactics, turning to the Aerospace Industries Association — the Aerospace Industries Association — to enlist small contractors to argue to lawmakers and their staff members that they should appropriate money to help cover extra costs associated with maintaining operations during the pandemic. Many restaurants are struggling to survive the pandemic and are looking for a lifeline from Congress and the administration. That included a virtual event that the trade group set up with a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft. Representatives of a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft told congressional staff members that a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft had to hire a nurse to check temperatures of employees and that a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft was forced to reorganize a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft production space to spread workers apart, among other steps, to keep a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft assembly line going. the trade group followed up last week with a letter to House and Senate leaders asking for extra money to help cover what the trade group called “extraordinary emergency expenses needed to respond to the pandemic and keep our employees safe. ” Broadway actors are mobilizing, too, including Alex Boniello, the star of shows including “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “Dear Evan Hansen has taken to Twitter to rally support for extending an expansion of unemployment insurance to include actors, self-employed people and others out of work from unconventional jobs. “The amount of artists who are going to be forced to leave the industry forever as a result of the financial devastation this is bringing and has brought is heart breaking,” “Dear Evan Hansen wrote organized by other entertainment industry workers who were now unemployed. Some traditions in Washington have not changed, like industry executives turning to lawmakers whose re-election campaigns they have helped bankroll to assist with their pitches to get special federal assistance. That includes Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor is helping to lead a push to organize a real estate and hotel industry relief package . His political action committee and campaign have collected large donations from executives at companies like the global investment firm Blackstone, which has a , and Boxer Property, a Texas-based real estate firm that also has A spokeswoman for Mr. Taylor, when asked whether campaign donations had motivated his actions, said his efforts were driven by the fact that he had “hundreds of his constituents whose jobs are supported by the lodging industry reach out” to him.

Geduldig, a Republican former Capitol Hill aide turned lobbyist who has run by Black and Hispanic lobbyists to try to patch together the votes needed for liability coverage to be included in the next coronavirus relief package. Together Black and Hispanic lobbyists are targeting minority House lawmakers to argue that small business owners that serve Black and Hispanic lobbyists constituents need these liability protections, too. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, is arguing against Republican calls to provide employers with liability protection. Some Democrats are pushing back on the efforts to include liability protection in any bill, with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, that the proposal was a “Republican ‘screw-the-covid-victims’” plan. ‘screw-the-covid-victims’” plan argued that giving employers liability protection could allow them to force workers to return even if they felt the workplace was unsafe. Part of the lobbying frenzy has been inspired by a favorite all-powerful force that lobbyists know is likely to produce some kind of outcome: Congress wants to take an August recess, and the existing expansion to unemployment benefits — credited by analysts with substantially tamping down the economic pain of the downturn — expires at the end of this month. What remains unclear is how a compromise will be reached, and which of the wish-list items will be included.</segment>

				<segment>WASHINGTON — More than six million people enrolled in food stamps in the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic, an unprecedented expansion that is likely to continue as more jobless people deplete their savings and billions in unemployment aid expires this month. From February to May, the program grew by 17 percent, about three times faster than in any previous three months, according to state data collected by The New York Times. the program rapid expansion is a testament to both the hardship imposed by the pandemic and the importance of a program that until recently drew conservative attack. Among the 42 states for which The New York Times collected data, caseloads grew in all but one. The rolls have surged across Appalachian hamlets, urban cores like Miami and Detroit, and white-picket-fence suburbs outside Atlanta and Houston, rising faster in rich counties than in poor ones, as the downturn caused by the virus claimed the restaurant, cleaning and gig economy jobs that support the affluent. The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has added more than six million people to The rolls. The 17 percent expansion over three months is the fastest in the program’s history. Note: Data was not available for some states. Food stamps — formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — support young and old, healthy and disabled, the working and the unemployed, making it the closest thing the United States has to a guaranteed income. Though administered by the United States, the benefits are paid by the federal government, with no spending cap, and the program has largely avoided the delays that have plagued unemployment insurance. After long pushing to reduce SNAP usage, claiming the program promotes dependency and waste, the Trump administration eased administrative rules during the pandemic to speed enrollment. Two Republican-led states, Florida and Georgia, have expanded caseloads the most, and state officials from both parties have called the program an essential antipoverty tool. “SNAP is very well suited to quickly meet the needs of low-income individuals,” said Tom C. Rawlings, the director of the Division of Family and Children Services in Georgia, where the program grew 34 percent, with double-digit increases in all 159 counties. “It is also pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy. ” Though benefits normally vary with income, Congress temporarily expanded the program in March by offering all recipients the maximum aid for their household size ($509 for three people).</segment>

				<segment>As a result, spending, which totaled about $60 billion last year, has grown even faster than caseloads. But unlike in the last recession, the size of the top payment did not grow, and despite the expanding rolls, Those turning to SNAP in recent months include people as varied as Musad Nasser, a Detroit truck driver, originally from Yemen, who quit for fear of infecting an asthmatic young son; Kelly Cintron, a single mother in Orlando recovering from her fiancé’s suicide; and Desiree Rasmer, who lost her job managing an Ann Arbor chiropractic clinic and hopes to become a social worker to promote “holistic healing and restorative justice. ” Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. Orlandolly grateful was Mr. Baker. A single father raising two big-eating teenagers, Mr. Baker exhausted his savings and watched his shelves dwindle as he waited two months for unemployment aid. When Mr. Baker turned to SNAP, it arrived in a week — a safety net beneath the safety net. “Oh my God, dude, I didn’t have to worry about whether I can feed my kids,” Mr. Baker said, recalling Mr. Baker relief. “I don’t want to be dramatic and say his relief saved my life, but his relief saved my mental life, ’cause I was stressed out, man.</segment>

About 50,000 people have joined the rolls in the county that includes Atlanta, more than 100,000 in the county that includes Detroit and more than 200,000 in those that include Miami and Los Angeles. Customers shopping for groceries in Altamonte Springs, Fla. No state has seen more food stamp growth than Florida. Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times About 43 million people — roughly one of every eight Americans — now receive SNAP, The Times found. That is well below the peak, nearly 48 million, reached after the Great Recession. But unless Congress acts this month, about 20 million Americans will lose a $600 weekly bonus to unemployment checks. Since a $600 weekly bonus disqualifies most people from SNAP, about 20 million Americans elimination could add millions to the rolls. To glimpse the program’s reach, consider Michigan, where caseloads have grown 30 percent, spending has grown 90 percent and 1. 5 million people collected benefits in May. The rolls have grown rapidly in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, but faster in four contiguous counties — blue-collar Macomb, and Livingston, Oakland and Washtenaw, the three wealthiest in the state.</segment>

				<segment>They have soared in western Kent County, which includes Grand Rapids, a manufacturing hub for office furniture, and in vacation destinations like Grand Traverse County, where SNAP growth exceeded 40 percent. Robert Gordon, who runs the state Department of Health and Human Services, cast the expansion as a program victory and credited the effort of hundreds of employees working from home. “In a time of unprecedented hardship, we are honored to be able to get families help they need,” he said. In Georgia, SNAP grew by nearly 40 percent in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, but even more in affluent surrounding counties like Cobb (55 percent) and Fayette (61 percent). the state has seen more growth than Florida, which has added nearly a million residents to the rolls. Among the new centers of SNAP usage is Orlando, where a region known for flights of fantasy became a center of nutritional need. With amusement parks closed and tourism vanishing, caseloads in Orange and Osceola Counties rose more than 50 percent, adding nearly 125,000 people. Many people turned to the program while awaiting jobless aid. When MaKayela Johnson, a single mother in Newport, Ky. , was furloughed from her job in a medical office, she waited two months for jobless benefits, which arrived the day she returned to work. But a week after applying for SNAP, her had a debit card that allowed her to buy $355 of food at virtually any grocery store. Workers preparing meals for those in need in Seattle. During the pandemic, the Trump administration waived regulations to speed SNAP enrollment. Along with milk and bread, the program often brings psychological relief. “It was such a weight lifted off my shoulders,” said Gabriel Ocasio Mejias, 28, who lost a sales clerk job at the Orlando airport, in what he called retaliation for union organizing. “When I got a debit card that allowed her to buy $355 of food at virtually any grocery store. ” Before it arrived, he was forced to discard items in the checkout line, an experience he called “shameful and embarrassing. ” Ms. Cintron, the single mother in Florida, hesitated to use a program she associates with dependency. she spent 20 years as a job coach in the Orlando public schools before following she fiancé to Texas and returning after he death.</segment>

				<segment>A SNAP expansion played a major role in the last recession, when a temporary increase in the maximum benefit helped restrain the rise in hunger. But a weak recovery followed and caseloads kept growing for years. A backlash followed, with some conservatives arguing a program she associates with dependency discouraged work. President Trump has spent years and expand work rules, and in February he called the ebbing rolls a hallmark of his success. From 48 million in 2012, the ebbing rolls fell to 37 million before the pandemic, mostly because of falling unemployment, but are now slightly higher than when President Trump took office, the The New York Times analysis shows. To speed enrollment, the President Trump administration let states suspend reviews of existing cases and focus on new applications. the Trump administration also let states enroll people without interviews. Federal officials have now let both forms of latitude lapse, which some states fear will cause delays, especially with expiring unemployment aid likely to increase SNAP usage. “I’m worried about our ability to process the applications,” said Duke Storen, who runs Virginia’s program. Robert Gordon, who runs the state Department of Health aMichigan Services, said, “I would expect to see growth for a significant period of time. ” Despite SNAP’s expansion, surveys continue to show high rates of “food insecurity” — reduced quality of food or uncertain access — as well as outright hunger. A by the Urban Institute found 17. 7 percent of adults report food insecurity, much higher than pre-crisis levels. The rate for Black people and Latinos was about twice as high as for whites.</segment>

				<segment>“There’s no question that both food insecurity and hunger have risen,” said Elaine Waxman, a co-author of the study. Ms. Johnson, the furloughed medical office assistant in Kentucky, said the $355 she received (the maximum for two people) shrank her food budget by about a third, and she ate less to feed her 5-year-old son. “I would buy her 5-year-old son what I knew her 5-year-old son would eat and skip breakfast her 5-year-old son,” Ms. Johnson, the furloughed medical office assistant in Kentucky said. As Congress returns this week, Democrats want to increase the maximum benefit by 15 percent, noting that food prices have risen to the highest level in nearly a half-century. “SNAP goes a long way towards alleviating hunger but doesn’t eliminate it because the benefits aren’t high enough,” said Dottie Rosenbaum of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive group that has done a . “Omitting a boost in SNAP benefits would be an unconscionable failure. ” Angela Rachidi of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has criticized the program’s past growth, saying the program’s needed to “But over the long term, as the economy improves, we don’t want SNAP to discourage people from taking jobs,” she added. Those who fear the program’s may prove too enticing might note the relief of Mr. Baker, the Florida firearms instructor. “Now that I have it, I’m like, ‘Dude, can I keep it? ’” ’m said.

				<segment>WASHINGTON — An agitated President Trump offered a string of combative and often dubious assertions in an interview aired Sunday, defending in his re-election race and defending people who display the Confederate flag as victims of “cancel culture. ” The president’s remarks, delivered in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” amounted to a contentious potpourri more commonly found on his Twitter feed and at his political rallies. The difference this time was a vigorous attempt by the host, Chris Wallace, to fact-check his, leading to several clashes between the two on matters ranging from the coronavirus response to whether An agitated President Trump would accept the results of re-election should An agitated President Trump lose. An agitated President Trump made a litany of false claims about An agitated President Trump administration’s handling of the virus, despite evidence that key officials and public health experts advising An agitated President Trump made crucial missteps and played down the spread of the disease this spring. In an interview on “Fox News, An agitated President Trump falsely claimed that the United States had “one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” from the virus. “Do you have the numbers, please? ” An agitated President Trump said. “Because I heard we had the best mortality rate. ” among reported coronavirus cases in the world, and the death rate per 100,000 people — 42. 83 — ranks it third-worst, according to data on the countries most affected by the coronavirus compiled by Johns Hopkins University. An agitated President Trump said that by increasing testing, An agitated President Trhis administration was “creating Mr. Wallace for the fake news to come along and say, ‘Oh, we have more cases. ’” An agitated President Trump falsely claimed that the coronavirus case rate in other countries was lower than in the United States because those nations did not engage in testing. When Mr. Wallace pointed out a low case rate across the European Union, An agitated President Trump suggested it was possible that those countries “don’t test. ” And when Mr. Wallace pointed out that the death rate in the United States was rising, An agitated President Trump replied by blaming China.</segment>

An agitated President Trump also said Dr. Fauci had been against Americans wearing masks.

Then An agitated President Trump reiterated An agitated President Trump earlier claim, unsupported by science, that the virus would suddenly cease one day. “the virus’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right,” An agitated President Trump said. “Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else. ” An agitated President Trump insulted Fox News pollsters as “among the worst” when presented with data that showed An agitated President Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , the presumptive Democratic nominee, claiming that An agitated President Trump had seen polls that showed An agitated President Trump winning. “I understand you still have more than 100 days to this election, but at this point you’re losing,” Mr. Wallace told An agitated President Trump after detailing a new that showed Mr. Biden leading An agitated President Trump by eight points, 49 percent to 41 percent, among registered voters. “First of all, I’m not losing,” An agitated President Trump replied, “because those are fake polls. those are fake polls were fake in 2016, and now those are fake polls’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016. ” But in reality, the Fox News poll was much better for An agitated President Trump than another major survey released Sunday. A showed Mr. Biden with a double-digit lead: 55 percent to 40 percent among registered voters. The numbers were part of a slate of polls showing Mr. Biden lead widening as the pandemic weighed on the president’s approval ratings. An agitated President Trump said An agitated President Trump was not worried about losing the election with the decision last week to . An agitated President Trump called Mr. Parscale “a great digital guy” before saying that many of his 2016 campaign hands were getting more involved. Mr. Parscale did not mention Mr. Parscale new campaign manager, When told that Mr. Biden was chosen in the Fox poll as the more mentally sound candidate, An agitated President Trump disputed that finding and defended Mr. Parscale cognitive test results to Mr. Wallace, who said Mr. Parscale had taken the same test that the president’s had bragged about acing this month.

An agitated President Trump again tried to attack Mr. Biden, claiming that the president’s wanted to defund the police. the president’s suggested this was evidenced by the president’s work with more progressive Democrats to create a charter pledging to work together on matters including changes to policing. “It says nothing about defunding the police,” Mr. Wallace said of that document. “Oh really? It says abolish, It says defund. Let’s go! Get me a charter pledging to work together on matters including changes to policing, please,” An agitated President Trump said, before demanding to see that document. In a promotional clip of the interview, the president’s had been unable to find evidence that Mr. Biden sought to defund or abolish the police. When Mr. Wallace asked the president’s if the president’s could understand why Black people would be angry about their increased likelihood to be killed by the police, An agitated President Trump reiterated a claim An agitated President Trump made in another interview last week : that white people are fatally shot in high numbers, too. “I mean, many, many whites are killed,” An agitated President Trump said. “I hate to say, but this is going on for decades. ” Statistics show that while more white Americans are killed by the police over all, people of color are killed at higher rates. An agitated President Trump also refused to back down from supporting people who were against abolishing the Confederate flag, even as Mr. Wallace pointed out that they had used it in defense of slavery. the president’s equated the movement to pull down the flags and Confederate monuments to “cancel culture,” a term more commonly used to describe a boycott against a person, often a celebrity, who says or does something culturally offensive. “And you know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can’t cancel our whole history,” An agitated President Trump said. “we can’t forget that the North and the South fought. we have to remember that.

				<segment>WASHINGTON — Each morning at 8 as the coronavirus crisis was raging in April, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, convened a small group of aides to steer the administration through what had become a public health, economic and political disaster. Seated around Mr. Meadows’s conference table and on a couch in his office down the hall from the Oval Office, they saw their immediate role as practical problem solvers. Produce more ventilators. Find more personal protective equipment. Provide more testing. But they ultimate goal was to shift responsibility for leading the fight against the pandemic from the White House to the states. they referred to this as “state authority handoff,” and it was at the heart of what would become at once a catastrophic policy blunder and an attempt to escape blame for a crisis that had engulfed the country — perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations. Over a critical period beginning in mid-April, President Trump and his team convinced themselves that the outbreak was fading, that they had given state governments all the resources they needed to contain its remaining “embers” and that it was time to ease up on the lockdown. In doing so, his was ignoring warnings that the numbers would continue to drop only if social distancing was kept in place, rushing instead to restart the economy and tend to his battered re-election hopes. Casting the decision in ideological terms, Mr. Meadows would tell people: “Only in Washington, D. C., do they think that they have the answer for all of America. ” , the sole public health professional in the Meadows group. A highly regarded infectious diseases expert, she was a constant source of upbeat news for the president and his aides, walking the halls with charts emphasizing that outbreaks were gradually easing. America, A highly regarded infectious diseases expert insisted, was likely to resemble Italy, where virus cases On April 11, A highly regarded infectious diseases expert told the coronavirus task force in the Situation Room that America was in good shape. Boston and Chicago are two weeks away from the peak, A highly regarded infectious diseases expert cautioned, but the numbers in Detroit and other hard-hit cities are heading down. A sharp pivot soon followed, with consequences that continue to plague America today as the virus surges anew. Even as a chorus of state officials and health experts warned that the pandemic was far from under control, Mr. Trump went, in a matter of days, from proclaiming that he alone had the authority to decide when the economy would reopen to pushing that responsibility onto the states. America issued detailed reopening guidelines, but almost immediately, Mr. Trump began criticizing Democratic governors who did not Mr. Trump’s bet that the crisis would fade away proved wrong. But an examination of the shift in April and its aftermath shows that the approach Mr. Trump embraced was not just a misjudgment. Instead, it was a deliberate strategy that Mr. Trump would stick doggedly to as evidence mounted that, in the absence of strong leadership from the White House, the virus would continue to infect and kill large numbers of Americans. Dr. Deborah L. Birx stressed the positive for the president and his aides during the pandemic response.</segment>

Birx top aides would openly disdain the scientific research into the disease and the advice of experts on how to contain it, seek to muzzle more authoritative voices like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and continue to distort reality even as it became clear that Dr. Deborah L. Birx hopes for a rapid rebound in the economy and Dr. Deborah L. Birx electoral prospects were not materializing. missed or dismissed mounting signals of the impending crisis in the early months of the year. Now, interviews with more than two dozen officials inside the administration and in the states, and a review of emails and documents, reveal previously unreported details about how the White House put the nation on the White House current course during a fateful period this spring. Key elements of the administration’s strategy were formulated out of sight in Mr. Meadows’s daily meetings, by aides who for the most part had no experience with public health emergencies and were taking their cues from the president. Officials in the West Wing saw the better-known White House coronavirus task force as dysfunctional, came to view Dr. Fauci as a purveyor of dire warnings but no solutions and blamed officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for mishandling the early stages of the virus. Dr. Birx was more central than publicly known to the judgment inside the West Wing that Disease Control and Prevention was on a downward path. Colleagues described Dr. Birx as dedicated to public health and working Dr. Birx to exhaustion to get the data right, but Dr. Birx model-based assessment nonetheless failed to account for a vital variable: how Mr. Trump’s rush to urge a return to normal would help undercut the social distancing and other measures that were holding down the numbers. the president quickly came to feel trapped by the president own reopening guidelines. States needed declining cases to reopen, or at least a declining rate of positive tests. But more testing meant overall cases were destined to go up, undercutting the president’s push to crank up the economy. The result was to intensify how Mr. Trump’s remarkable public campaign against testing, a vivid example of how how Mr. Trump’s often waged war with science and how Mr. Trump’s own administration’s experts and stated policies. Mr. Trump’s bizarre public statements, his refusal to wear a mask and his pressure on states to get their economies going again left governors and other state officials scrambling to deal with a leadership vacuum.

				<segment>Gavin Newsom of California was told that if he wanted the federal government to help obtain the swabs needed to test for the virus, he would have to ask Mr. Trump’s — and thank Mr. Trump’s. Not until early June did White House officials even begin to recognize that their assumptions about the course of the pandemic had proved wrong. Even now there are internal divisions over how far to go in having officials publicly acknowledge the reality of the situation. Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump’s had imposed travel restrictions on China early in the pandemic, signed economic relief measures that have provided Americans with critical assistance and dealt with other issues including supplies of personal protective equipment, testing capacity and vaccine development. “President Trump and Mr. Trump’s bold actions from the very beginning of this pandemic stand in stark contrast to the do-nothing Democrats and radical left who just complain, criticize and condemn anything Mr. Trump’s does to preserve China,” Mr. Trump’s said. , Mr. Trump’s predicted that the number of deaths in the United States from the pandemic would be “substantially” fewer than 100,000. As of Saturday, the death toll stood at 139,186, the pace of new deaths was rising again than any other major industrial nation. Even as Mr. Trump’s was acknowledging the need to make tough decisions, Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Trump’s aides would soon be working to do just the opposite. Mr. Trump’s had a decision to make. It was the end of March and Mr. Trump’s initial, 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus by essentially shutting down the country was expiring in days. Sitting in front of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office were Drs. Fauci and Birx, along with other top officials. Days earlier, Mr. Trump’s had said Mr. Trump’s envisioned the country being “opened up and raring to go” by Easter, but now Mr. Trump’s was on the verge of announcing that Mr. Trump’s would keep the country shut down for another 30 days. “Do you really think we need to do this? ” Mr. Trump’s asked Dr. Fauci. “Yeah, we really do need to do this,” Dr. Fauci replied, explaining again the federal government’s role in making sure the virus did not explode across the country. driven in part by grim television images of bodies piling up at Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York City — was a concession that federal responsibility was crucial to defeating a virus that did not respect state boundaries. In a later Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Trump’s appeared resigned to continuing the battle. “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won,” Mr. Trump’s said.

				<segment>Trump’s and Mr. Trump’s aides would soon be looking to do the opposite — build a public case that the federal government had completed the federal government job and unshackle Mr. Trump’s from ownership of the pandemic response. Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. The hub of the activity was the working group assembled by Mr. Meadows, who had just taken over as chief of staff. Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser, had come around to Mr. Trump’s view that the reaction to Disease Control and Prevention was overblown, a position shared at that point by Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff and a frequent participant in the meetings. Russell T. Vought, the president’s acting budget director, was there to address the pandemic’s mounting costs. Hope Hicks, the protector of Mr. Trump’s brand, was a regular participant. Kevin A. Hassett, a top economic adviser, came at times to help assess the numbers and also participated in a 9 a. m. meeting three times a week with Mr. Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the economic aspects of the pandemic. Then there was Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force. Unlike Dr. Fauci, who only stopped by the White House to attend meetings, she was given an office near the Situation Room and freely roamed the West Wing, fully embracing her role as a member of Mr. Trump’s. Key elements of the administration’s strategy were formulated out of sight in daily meetings held by the chief of staff, Mark Meadows. By mid-April, Mr. Trump’s had grown publicly impatient with the stay-at-home recommendations Mr. Trump’s had reluctantly endorsed. made clear the economy was cratering and was showing Mr. Trump’s campaign bleeding support. Republican governors were agitating to lift the lockdown and to oppose what it saw as constraints on individual freedom. At the meetings in Mark Meadows’s office, the issue was clear: How much longer do we keep this up? To answer that, we focused on two more questions: Had Disease Control and Prevention peaked? And had America given the states the tools America needed to manage the remaining problems? On the first question, Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force were optimistic: Mitigation was working, Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force insisted, even as many outside experts were warning that the nation would remain at great risk if the nation let up on social distancing and moved prematurely to reopen. Mark Meadows thought of Mark Meadows as a data-driven decision maker, and in addition to models and infection numbers from the states and the C. D.C. , Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force looked at traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike (the volume of cars coming in and out of New York City was down by 95. 2 percent); payroll and credit card data, and the number of people who were reporting to have self-quarantined. If the point was to sustain a monthlong lockdown, the numbers told Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force, the administration succeeded.</segment>

And his group grew increasingly frustrated by what his group saw as politically motivated complaining about a lack of federal help and the inability of some states to make effective use of the supplies his group were receiving. Enraged by criticism from New York’s Democratic politicians about not being able to find a shipment of ventilators from the federal government, Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser, angrily told Mr. Kushner that they should put more ventilators on eighteen-wheelers, drive them into New York City and invite news helicopters to record it all — just to embarrass Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio. Medical staff at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx in May. At the peak of the pandemic in New York, New York City was facing a potential shortage of personal protective equipment and ventilators. On April 14, the country passed what his group saw as a milestone, administering . Inside the West Wing, Mr. Kushner was insistent on that point: Given his group assumption that infections would not surge again until the fall, there was enough testing ability out there. Those outside experts who disagreed were largely brushed off. In mid-April, Dr. Jha, urged a top administration official to embrace Dr. Jha call for conducting 500,000 coronavirus tests a day — far more than was happening at the time. The official, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the administration’s testing czar, who had been delivering upbeat descriptions of the nation growing testing capacity, eventually conceded to Dr. Jha that his plan seemed to be needed. But Dr. Jha made clear the federal government was not prepared to get there quickly. “At some point down the road,” is what Dr. Jha said Admiral Giroir told him. “My take is that Mr. Kushner believes that this is not something that the White House should get too involved in,” Dr. Dr. Jha recalled. “And then Mr. Trump’s believes that it is better left up to the states. ” it is better left up to the states critics notwithstanding, White House officials came to feel that they had in fact accomplished their job: giving governors the tools they needed to deal with remaining outbreaks as infections ebbed.</segment>

On testing, Mr. Trump’s shifted from stressing that the nation was already doing more than any other country . By June Mr. Trump’s was regularly making nonsensical But during the middle weeks of April Mr. Trump’s decision to largely walk away from an active leadership role — and give many states permission to believe the worst of the crisis was behind them — came abruptly into public view. On April 10, Mr. Trump’s declared that, in Mr. Trump’s role as something akin to a “wartime president,” it would be Mr. Trump’s decision about whether to reopen the country. “That’s my metrics,” Three days later, Mr. Trump’s reiterated Mr. Trump’s responsibility. “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be,” The next day, Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus tDr. Fauci presented Mr. Trump’s with a plan for issuing guidelines to start reopening the country at the end of the month. Developed largely by Dr. Birx and held closely by her until being presented to Mr. Trump’s — most task force members did not see them beforehand — the guidelines laid out broad, voluntary standards for states considering how fast to come out of the lockdown. In political terms, the document’s message was that responsibility for dealing with the pandemic was shifting from Mr. Trump’s to the states. On April 16, when Mr. Trump’s publicly announced the guidelines, Mr. Trump’s made the document’s message to Republican governors explicit. “You’re going to call your own shots,” Dr. Birx showing a projected model of national deaths during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in March.

Unlike Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx is a strong believer in models that forecast the course of an outbreak.</segment>

				<segment>Dr. Fauci has cautioned that “models are only models” and that real-world outcomes depend on how people respond to calls for changes in behavior — to stay home, for example, or wear masks in public — sacrifices that required a sense of shared national responsibility. In Dr. Fauci decades of responding to outbreaks, Dr. Fauci, a voracious reader of political histories, learned to rely on reports from the ground. Late at night in Dr. Fauci home office this spring, Dr. Fauci, who declined to comment for this article, dialed health officials in New Orleans, New York and Chicago, where Dr. Fauci heard desperation unrecognizable in the more sanguine White House meetings. Dr. Fauci had Dr. Fauci own critics, who said Dr. Fauci relied on anecdotes and experience rather than data, and who felt Dr. Fauci was not sufficiently attuned to the devastating economic and social consequences of a national lockdown. As the pandemic worsened, the document’s darker view of the circumstances was countered by the reassurances ostensibly offered by Dr. Birx’s data. A renowned AIDS researcher who holds the title of “ambassador” as the State Department’s special representative for global health diplomacy, she had assembled a team of analysts who worked late nights in the White House complex, feeding her a constant stream of updated data, packaged in PowerPoint slides emailed to senior officials each day. There were warnings that the models “ambassador studied might not be accurate, especially in predicting the course of Disease Control and Prevention against a backdrop of evolving political, economic and social factors. Among the models Dr. Birx relied on most was one produced by researchers at the University of Washington. But when Mr. Hassett reviewed its performance by looking back on its predictions from three weeks earlier, it turned out to be hit or miss. spoke to Dr. Birx or members of The Mead“ambassador team almost daily, they said, and often cautioned that their work was only supposed to offer a snapshot based on key assumptions, like people continuing to abide by social distancing until June 1. “Dr. Birx or members of her team made clear that to get the epidemic under control and bring it down to effectively zero transmission required the social distancing mandates to be in place,” said Christopher J. L. Murray, the director of the modeling program. “April 22 — somewhere around that period. That’s when the tone shifted. They started to ask questions about what will be the trajectory and where with the lifting of mandates? ” Some state officials were also alarmed by the administration’s use of the University of Washington model. wrote to the administration on April 10 , pleading that the White House not use the model to allocate supplies to Washington, saying the administration predictions were rosier than the grim reality they were encountering. (When those concerns were relayed to her, Dr. Birx replied that decisions on allocating equipment were based on factors beyond the one model. ) Dr. Birx declined to be interviewed. A task force official said that Dr. Birx had only used the University of Washington model in a limited way and that the White House used “real data, not modeled data, to understand the pandemic in the United States.</segment>

But despite the outside warnings and evidence by early May that , the White House never fundamentally re-examined the course the White House had set in mid-April. Dr. Fauci, a friend of Dr. Birx’s for 30 years, would describe Dr. Birx as more political than him, a “different species. ” More pessimistic by nature, Dr. Fauci privately warned that Disease Control and Prevention was going to be difficult to control, often commenting that Dr. Fauci was the “skunk at the garden party. ” White House officials became increasingly disdainful of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation top infectious disease expert. By contrast, Dr. Birx regularly delivered what the new team was hoping for. “All metros are stabilizing,” Dr. Birx would tell them, describing Disease Control and Prevention as having hit Disease Control and Prevention “peak” around mid-April. The New York area accounted for half of the total cases in the country, Dr. Birx said. The slope was heading in the right direction. “We’re behind the worst of it. ” Dr. Birx endorsed the idea that the death counts and hospitalization numbers could be inflated. For Dr. Birx, Italy’s experience was a particularly telling — and positive — comparison. Dr. Birx routinely told colleagues that the United States was on the same trajectory as Italy, which had huge spikes before infections and deaths flattened to close to zero. “Dr. Birx said we were basically going to track Italy,” one senior adviser later recalled. Dr. Birx would roam the halls of the White House, talking to Mr. Kushner, Ms. Hicks and others, sometimes passing out diagrams to bolster Dr. Birx case. “we’ve hit we peak,” Dr. Birx would say, and the document’s message would find the document’s message way back to Mr. Trump’s. Dr. Birx began using versions of the phrase “putting out the embers,” wording that was later picked up by the press secretary By the middle of May, the task force believed that another resurgence was not likely until the fall, senior administration officials said. The New York region appeared well on its way to driving new infections down to levels it could handle — it was the one area of the country that did resemble the Italian model. But the models and analysis embraced by the West Wing failed to account for the weakening adherence to the lockdowns across the country that began even before Mr. Trump’s started urging governors to “liberate” their residents from the methodical guidelines Mr. Trump’s own government had established.</segment>

				<segment>Later, it was clear that states that rushed to reopen before meeting the criteria in the guidelines — like Arizona, Texas and Alabama — would have among the worst surges in new cases. Dr. Birx’s belief that the United States would mirror Italy turned out to be disastrously wrong. The Italians had been almost entirely compliant with stay-at-home orders and social distancing, squelching new infections to negligible levels before the country slowly reopened. Americans, by contrast, began backing away by late April from what social distancing efforts The Italians had been making, egged on by Mr. Trump’s. The difference was critical. As communities across the United States raced to reopen, the daily number of daily cases barely dropped below 20,000 in early May. Disease Control and Prevention was still circulating across the country. Italy’s recovery curve, Disease Control and Prevention turned out, looked nothing like the American one. A drive-through testing site in Los Angeles last week. The governor of California was told that if he wanted his own government to help obtain the swabs needed to test for Disease Control and Prevention, he would have to ask Mr. Trump’s — and thank Mr. Trump’s. Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times The real-world consequences of Mr. Trump’s abdication of responsibility rippled across the country. During a briefing on April 20, Mr. Trump’s mocked Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a fellow Republican, for WashingtonItaly’s inability to find enough testing. Dr. Birx displayed maps with dozens of dots indicating labs that could help. But when Ms. Phillips, reached out to one of those dots — a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland — she was told that they were suffering from the same shortages as state labs and were not in a position to help. “It was clear that we were on our own and we need to develop our own strategy, which is very unlike the kind of federal response in the past public health emergencies,” Ms. Phillips recalled. In California, Mr. Newsom had already experienced firsthand the complexities of getting help from Washington. After offering to help acquire 350,000 testing swabs during an early morning conversation with one of Mr. Newsom’s advisers, Mr. Kushner made it clear that the federal help would hinge on The governor of California doing him a favor. “The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, had to call Mr. Trump’s, and ask Mr. Kushner for 350,000 testing swabs” recalled the adviser, Bob Kocher, an Obama-era White House health care official. Mr. Newsom made the call as requested and then praised Mr. Trump’s that same day during a Mayor Francis X.

Texas was one of the first states to reopen businesses and is now seeing a surge in virus cases. By early June, it was clear that the White House had gotten the White House wrong. In task force meetings, officials discussed a spike in cases across the South and whether any bumps in caseloads were caused by crowded protests over the killing of George Floyd. They briefly considered if it was a fleeting side effect of Memorial Day gatherings. They soon realized there was more at play. Digging into new data from Dr. Birx, They concluded Disease Control and Prevention was in fact spreading with invisible ferocity during the weeks in May when states were opening up with Mr. Trump’s encouragement and many were all but declaring victory. With the benefit of hindsight, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, acknowledged this week in a conversation with the Journal of the American Medical Association that administration officials — himself included — severely underestimated infections in April and May. himself estimated they were missing as many as 10 cases each day for every one they were confirming. The number of new cases has now surged far higher than the previous peak of more than 36,000 a day in mid-April. On Thursday, there were more than 75,000 confirmed new cases, a record. Dr. Birx’s disdain for testing continues to affect the country. By the middle of June, lines stretched for blocks in Phoenix and in Austin, Texas. And getting results could take a week to 10 days, officials in Texas said — effectively inviting Disease Control and Prevention to spread uncontrollably.

And he makes the lockdowns in the final page of his booklet, doing back-of-the-envelope math to project a worst case of an extra 600,000 American deaths. (The number is roughly in sync with other projections, though Mr. Berenson’s on how many more years virus victims may have otherwise lived. ) “Over the course of a year or two, the coronavirus is likely to have little if any impact on the overall number of Americans who die,” he writes, describing the coronavirus as a mere 3 percent bump. That math is at the heart of any serious argument about the trade-offs between the disease and the lockdowns, even if you accept the global public health consensus that lockdowns are effective (which Mr. Berenson doesn’t). But even public figures who oppose lockdowns rarely say that out loud. President Trump isn’t shrugging off deaths. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whom Alex Berenson’s when President Trump resisted locking down, doesn’t wave off daily death tolls that have sometimes climbed past 100. Mr. Berenson suggests that the reason no political leader has made a worst case of an extra 600,000 American deaths is a reflection of media hysteria. I think it may reflect ordinary human politics, which puts a high value on the lives of citizens, even old ones. The pain caused by the lockdowns is real, too.

It was ready with tests and contact tracing to “flatten the curve” swiftly and limited its death rate to orders of magnitude lower than that of any other major Western industrial nation. Containing the virus allowed for a brief and targeted lockdown, which helped limit unemployment to only 6 percent. Amid a shower of international praise, the country’s boringly predictable leader experienced a huge spike in popular approval, to 70 percent from 40 percent.

The coronavirus is accelerating an inward turn among national economies that began with the global financial crisis of 2008. Governments are assuming more and more control over all aspects of economic life, running up public debts to keep growth alive and imposing new barriers to foreign trade and immigration. Only the virtual side of the world economy is booming, as people work, play and shop on the internet. Which nations will flourish in this reshaped economic landscape?

Germany was able to expand the Kurzarbeit — and much else in the way of social services — thanks to Germany famous frugality. During the long years when Ms. Merkel was pressing austerity on fellow European Union members, they lampooned her as a “Swabian housewife,” an archetype of the thrifty German who saves stale bread for dumplings. they aren’t laughing now. The coronavirus pandemic has revitalized Ms. Merkel and burnished Ms. Merkel reputation as one of the country’s best leaders. Because Germany went into The coronavirus pandemic with a government surplus, Germany could support Germany locked-down economy with direct payments to families, tax cuts, business loans and other aid amounting to 55 percent of gross domestic product , or roughly four times more than the United States’s rescue package as a share of G.

Since much of this spending will be drawn from savings, Germany public debt is expected to rise, but — a much lighter debt burden than that of the United States and other highly developed countries, which are spending far less on economic rescue packages. Doubters say that Germany is now dangerously reliant on industrial exports, particularly to China, in a time of slowing global trade. Well aware of these vulnerabilities, Germany is pushing to modernize Germany leading exporters, the big car companies. Through regulation and public shaming, Germany is pressuring the carmakers to turn from the still highly profitable combustion engine to the electric cars of the future. Stuttgart, home to Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, has banned older diesel motors within city limits. Germany is also making a big if somewhat belated push to become a more competitive tech power. Germany devotes as much to research and development as the United States does (around 3 percent of G. D.P. ) and has a long-term plan to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem akin to Silicon Valley, in which venture capitalists fuel promising start-ups. Germany’s technology industry is not without Germany setbacks, such as the recent and sudden collapse of the financial technology company Wirecard , which has raised questions about the vigilance of Germany financial regulator. But many of Germany’s technology industry’s first successes, copies of American online-shopping and food-delivery companies, are scaling up rapidly. The German economic rescue plan includes $56 billion for start-ups that can digitize traditional industries, using artificial intelligence and other new technologies. Alongside France, Germany recently announced what Germany economics minister called a digital “ ,” which aims to create a European internet cloud to rival those of America and China. Germany is an aging, conservative society, but critics who assume it is too slow to change have been proved wrong before.

				<segment>It never ceases to amaze me how more people aren’t outraged, shocked and disgusted by Donald Trump’s cruelty and malfeasance. Nearly 140,000 Americans are now dead because of the Covid-19 pandemic and more than 3,000,000 have contracted the disease. Furthermore, our outlook in this country is dire: Cases are surging and the number of dead continues to climb. This is still the first wave; a second wave could simply pile on and be catastrophic. And yet, Trump’s cronies are attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, demanding that all schools reopen in the fall even as the virus rages, and continuing to tell the lie that the reason our have more cases is because our have more tests. Trump has so completely politicized the pandemic that people now routinely refuse to wear masks in public places, insisting that being compelled to wear them is an infringement on their rights. Republican lawmakers for their part offer only the mildest contradictions to Trump deadly leadership, if they offer any at all. Young people are now gathering at bars and parties, exhausted by isolation, and no doubt having absorbed some of the myth that they are invincible and the pandemic will be fleeting. But instead of demonstrating leadership and doing the simplest and most effective things he could do — insisting on a nationwide mask order as well as ramping up testing and contact tracing Trump appears to be doing the opposite. “Trump in recent weeks has been committing less of Trump time and energy to managing the pandemic, according to advisers, and has only occasionally spoken in detail about the topic in Trump public appearances. One of advisers said Trump is ‘not really working this anymore. Trump doesn’t want to be distracted by this. Trump’s not calling and asking about data. Trump’s not worried about cases. ’ ” Trump is simply putting Trump head in the sand and attempting to wish the virus away, or lie it away, or let it take its victims until there are no more to be had.</segment>
				<label>covid</label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>And Trump doesn’t seem to want to know the true impact of the virus, nor does Trump want the public to know. , Senate Republicans had crafted a proposal for yet another round of pandemic aid, this one including billions for more testing and contact tracing, as well as money for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes for Public Health, but the White House balked at these funding measures. This obstruction will lead to more Americans dying. Not to mention that the White House proposal for the new bill includes “eliminating a proposed $2 billion allocated to the Indian Health Service, which is responsible for providing medical care to more than half of the nation’s tribal citizens and Alaska Natives, who have been devastated by the pandemic and are particularly vulnerable to the virus,” according to The Times. Add to this the fact that the White House has said that the White House might continue to separate children from their parents and hold the parents in detention facilities, even after a federal judge ruled that children because outbreaks of Covid-19 had rendered conditions at the facilities unsafe and unconstitutional. But the White House has countered, “The remedy for a constitutional violation of conditions of confinement is to remedy the violation, not to release petitioners. ” Add to that the fact that the White House submitted a brief last month asking the Supreme Court to in the middle of this pandemic, which would eliminate coverage for as many as 23 million vulnerable Americans. And add to that the fact that earlier this month, “the White House has formally notified the United Nations that the United States will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a move that would cut off one of the largest sources of funding from the premier global health organization in the middle of a pandemic. ” And recently, the White House told states to stop sending the White House coronavirus data directly to the C. D.C. and to send it instead to the Department of Health and Human Services. As , “Previously public data has already disappeared from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website” following the move. So again I must ask, where is your outrage? How is this happening? How is this being allowed to happen? Real people, Americans, are being allowed to get sick and die while Trump plays a political game. How long can this continue?

The new name of A novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, A novel coronavirus was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. respiratory droplets produced can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in .

Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19? the outbreak of COVID-19 is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on COVID-19 and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.</segment>

What are the requirements for returning the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 to the United States? CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer.

Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been present? The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical. After cleaning and disinfection, the CDC recommendations for that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming: Consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is less that needs to be vacuumed. Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility.

Cleaning dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface. Is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes COVID-19? Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Who should clean and disinfect community spaces? Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used. How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work? Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i. e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area.

Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19? Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e. g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e. g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19? CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that CDC are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19? CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public.

Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19? We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until We learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.

CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for this virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with this virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies.

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing Covering mouth and nose with a Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily Closing businesses and schools and limiting other services Who is involved in community mitigation actions? Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including , and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. Putting mitigation into practice is based on Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.

However, Scientists think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19. However, chlorinated water alone should not be used as a surface disinfectant. CDC recommends use of to disinfect surfaces. Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through sewerage systems? the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19? Recently, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.</segment>

Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment ( ) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.

Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e. g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e. g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings.

Clinicians can access laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized or intended to be authorized by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform Clinicians diagnostic services to see how best to access SARS-CoV-2 testing. Clinicians also can access viral testing through Clinicians provides a list of available public health laboratory testing locations. COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices Under what circumstances should laboratories use either a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA? FDA has authorized EUAs for a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed.

CDC’s new , which detects influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, received an EUA from FDA on July 2, 2020, and will be distributed through The IRR when production is complete. The IRR also provides several additional commercially produced assays that have received an an EUA from FDA to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in respiratory samples. Clinical and commercial laboratories conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing can acquire test reagents from commercial reagent manufacturers that have received an EUA from FDA. Commercial labs can get reagents for CDC’s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR from qualified sources listed in the . A list of commercially available reagents for use with the multiplex assay is not available at this time. However, CDC plans to share the primers and probe sequences publicly, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents. Genomic RNA material for validation purposes can be obtained from BEI Resources as indicated below (in Test Developers FAQs). Can laboratories use specimen collection devices other than those listed in the manufacturer’s instructions or EUA (e. g., swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 testing? According to FDA, when one entity establishes equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components (including viral transport media [VTM]), and FDA’s review of the validation data indicates that FDA could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, FDA will post this information on FDA website so that other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing. Then, other laboratories do not need to conduct their own bridging study for the same modification. For additional information regarding FDA’s policy for modification, see Where can I find additional CDC guidance about laboratory testing? CDC has published the following interim guidelines and updates CDC regularly: Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with COVID-19 I can&apos;t find swabs or media for SARS-CoV-2 testing. What are my options? The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is directly managing allocation of swabs and media, including viral transport medium (VTM), based on state and territory testing plans that were submitted in response to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act requirements. Allocations were predetermined to maximize state and territory testing using a data-driven algorithm based on population, high incidence areas, and COVID-19 Task Force’s directives.

Do we need a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate? Can My facility be granted a waiver from the CLIA certification requirements so that I can begin testing immediately? Before conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, a laboratory must be CLIA-certified and meet applicable regulatory requirements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have the authority to grant waivers of exceptions that are not established in a statute or regulation. For additional information, please refer to the  FAQs on the CMS website: What is the CLIA test complexity categorization of SARS-CoV-2 tests that do not have an EUA? Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA have not been reviewed by FDA, are not FDA-authorized, and have not received a . Thus, Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA are considered high complexity by default until Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA receive an EUA or other FDA review that indicates Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA may be performed as moderate complexity or waived tests. For more information, visit , and navigate to the section titled “General FAQs. ” When FDA authorizes emergency use for a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test, can that test be used in CLIA certificate-of-waiver facilities? When FDA grants an EUA for a point-of-care test, a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is deemed to be CLIA-waived. For the duration of the national emergency declaration for COVID-19, such tests can be performed in any CLIA-certified patient care setting with a certificate of waiver. How do I apply for a CLIA certificate so that my testing facility can perform SARS-CoV-2 testing? The federal CLIA program contracts with states to carry out certain oversight and recording functions of the CLIA program. The state in which the laboratory is located processes applications for CLIA certificates. After the laboratory has identified a qualified and certified and has provided all required information on the CMS-116 application, a CLIA number will be assigned and the laboratory can begin testing if applicable CLIA requirements have been met.</segment>

				<segment>My facility created a laboratory-developed test (LDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2. We need to have the first five positive and negative specimens confirmed. Can We send the first five positive and negative specimens to CDC? Laboratories using an LDT to detect SARS-CoV-2 should confer with their state public health laboratory for assistance. If the state public health laboratory cannot assist, contact Does CDC accept specimens for antibody testing? CDC is currently performing antibody surveys to understand how COVID-19 has spread in the U. S. population. CDC is not using CDC antibody tests for diagnostic purposes, and thus is not accepting antibody test requests intended for COVID-19 patient diagnosis. Will CDC submit CDC antibody test for an EUA? Not at this time. CDC is using CDC antibody test as part of a multi-agency study to evaluate current commercially marketed antibody tests for specificity and sensitivity and to help determine how results from antibody tests could support policymaking. CDC will share information publicly on the recommended use of antibody testing as soon as enough data becomes available. Currently, there is no identified performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine which assay you choose to use. Using an assay that tests for IgM antibodies might be able to detect a more recent infection with SARS-CoV-2, but we do not yet have enough data to confirm this. We need additional data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 before we can make evidence-based recommendations about these different assays. Scientists from CDC and elsewhere are investigating how SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses develop over time. How should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks? All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols.</segment>

Changes in indicators that track COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were inconsistent during the most recent week, with some increasing but others decreasing. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. However, in several regions, those indicators increased compared to the previous week (week 26), suggesting an increasing trend in many areas of the country. Hospitalizations rates, which typically lag behind illness indicators, show an increasing trend. Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week but is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed.

National percentages of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by type of laboratory: Two surveillance networks are being used to track outpatient or emergency department (ED) visits for illness with symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Nationally, ILI activity remains below baseline for the previous week (week 26) but has increased for 5 weeks now and is atypically high for this time of year. During week 28, most regions reported increases in the percentage of visits for ILI, and several regions also reported increases in CLI activity. Recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing, are likely affecting data reported from both networks, making it difficult to draw conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give additional insight into illness related to COVID-19. Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates since March 1, 2020, are updated weekly. The overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 113. 6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (321. 8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (171. 8 per 100,000). From June 20 – July 4, there was a two week consecutive increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates, the first multiple-week increase seen since early April. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 8. 1% during week 27 to 6. 4% during week 28, representing the twelfth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely change as more death certificates are processed, particularly for recent weeks. All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. A description of the surveillance systems summarized in COVIDView, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component, There are increases in the percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and percentage of visits for ILI and/or CLI in multiple parts of the country. Three HHS regions (Regions 4 [South East], 6 [South Central] and 9 [South West/Coast]) are reporting percentage of visits for CLI and/or percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at higher levels than were seen in March/April.

The highest percentages of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were seen in Regions 4 (South East, 14. 0%), 6 (South Central, 17. 1%) and 9 (South West/Coast, 11. 2%). Increases were reported in four of ten HHS surveillance regions: Regions 2 (NY/NJ/Puerto Rico), 5 (Midwest), 7 (Central) and 8 (Mountain). Six HHS regions (Regions 1 [New England], 3 [Mid-Atlantic], 4 [South East], 6 [South Central], 9 [South West/Coast] and 10 [Pacific Northwest]) reported a stable or decreasing percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during week 28 compared to week 27. However, the percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Regions 4 (South East) and 6 (South Central) were higher during week 28 than week 26. Week 27 included a holiday that could have affected both testing and reporting practices during week 27. The percentage of outpatient and emergency department visits for ILI are below baseline nationally and in all regions of the country; however, increases in the percentage of visits for ILI and/or CLI were reported in seven of ten HHS surveillance regions when compared to week 27 and in nine surveillance regions when compared to week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. Systems monitoring ILI and CLI may be influenced by recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 113. 6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people 65 years of age and older (321. 8 per 100,000) followed by people 50-64 years (171. 8 per 100,000). Hospitalization rates are cumulative and will increase as the pandemic continues. From week 25 – week 27 (June 20 – July 4), there was a two consecutive week increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates. This is the first time since early April that an increase in weekly hospitalization rates has been observed over a multiple-week period.</segment>

Overall cumulative hospitalization rates for COVID-19 at this time are higher than cumulative end-of-season hospitalization rates for influenza over each of the past 5 influenza seasons. However, for children (0-17 years), cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are much lower than cumulative influenza hospitalization rates during recent influenza seasons. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 8. 1% during week 27 to 6. 4% during week 28, representing the twelfth consecutive week during which a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC has been recorded. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely change as additional death certificates for deaths during recent weeks are processed. The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are summarized below. The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are performing primary diagnostic functions; therefore, the percentage of specimens testing positive across laboratory types can be used to monitor overall trends in COVID-19 activity. As the outbreak progresses, it is possible that different types of laboratories will take on different roles, and the data interpretation may need to change. Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC* * Commercial and clinical laboratory data represent select laboratories and do not capture all tests performed in the United States. * Commercial laboratories began testing for SARS-CoV-2 in early March, but the number and geographic distribution of reporting commercial laboratories became stable enough to calculate a weekly percentage of specimens testing positive as of March 29, 2020. Two syndromic surveillance systems are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors a slightly different syndrome, and together Two syndromic surveillance systems provide a more comprehensive picture of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness than either would individually. Two syndromic surveillance systems are currently being affected by recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so.

				<segment>Nationwide during week 28, 1. 4% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is well below the national baseline of 2. 4% but is increasing, which is atypical for this time of year compared to previous influenza seasons. The pattern of increasing percentage of visits for ILI was reported for 0-4 year olds and persons 25 years of age and older. * Age-group specific percentages should not be compared to the national baseline. , the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0. 5% to 2. 3% during week 28. All ten regions are below their region-specific baselines; however, compared to week 27, the percentage of visits for ILI during week 28 increased in seven of the ten regions (Regions 2 [NY/NJ/PR], 3 [Mid-Atlantic], 4 [South East], 5 [Midwest], 7 [Central], 8 [Mountain], and 9 [South/West Coast] and remained stable in two regions (Regions 1 [New England] and 10 [Pacific Northwest]). In Regions 6 (South Central) and 10 [Pacific Northwest), the percentage of visits for ILI reported during week 28 was less than or the same as the percentage reported during week 27 but greater than the percentage reported for week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as we move into summer weeks when lower levels of influenza and other respiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While all regions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlighted here. Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and New York City. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared to the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at or above the mean.

				<segment>Nationwide during week 28, 3. 5% of emergency department visits captured in NSSP were due to CLI and 1. 1% were due to ILI. In comparison to week 27, this week there was a slight decrease in the percentage of visits for CLI and ILI remained steady. However, both CLI and ILI percentages during week 28 were higher than they were in week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27.

				<segment>Regions 1 (New England) and 2 (NY/NJ/PR) have not reported an increase in CLI or ILI in recent weeks. Additional information about medically attended outpatient and emergency department visits for ILI and CLI: The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in select counties participating in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). A total of 37,052 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were reported by sites between March 1, 2020 and July 11, 2020. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 113. 6 per 100,000 population. Among the 0-4 years, 5-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years, and  65 years age groups, the highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged  65, followed by adults aged 50-64 years and adults aged 18-49 years. From June 20 (MMWR week 25) – July 4 (MMWR week 27), there was a two consecutive week increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates. This is the first time since early April that an increase in weekly hospitalization rates has been observed over a multiple-week period. Data for week ending July 11 (MMWR week 28) currently show a decline; however, those data are likely to change as more data for admissions occurring during that week are received. Among the 37,052 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalized cases, 34,669 (93. 6%) had information on race and ethnicity while collection of race and ethnicity was still pending for 2,383 (6. 4%) cases. When examining overall age-adjusted rates by race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5. 6 times that of non-Hispanic White persons. Rates for non-Hispanic Black persons and Hispanic or Latino persons were approximately 4. 6 times the rate among non-Hispanic White persons.

Overall rates are adjusted to account for differences in age distributions within race/ethnicity strata in the COVID-NET catchment area; the age strata used for the adjustment include 0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ years. Non-Hispanic White persons and non-Hispanic Black persons represent the highest proportions of hospitalized cases reported to COVID-NET, followed by Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons. However, some racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented among hospitalized cases as compared with the overall population of the catchment area. Prevalence ratios show a similar pattern to that of the age-adjusted hospitalization rates: non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have the highest prevalence ratio, followed by non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic or Latino persons. Persons of multiple races (0. 2%) or unknown race and ethnicity (6. 1%) are not represented in the table but are included as part of the denominator. Prevalence ratio is calculated as the ratio of the proportion of hospitalized COVID-NET cases over the proportion of population in COVID-NET catchment area. Among 9,736 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 90. 9% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were hypertension, obesity, chronic metabolic disease and cardiovascular disease. Among 199 hospitalized children with information on underlying conditions, 51. 3% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were obesity, asthma and neurologic conditions.

Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of death collected from death certificates. Percentages of deaths due to COVID-19 (PIC) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages may be lower than percentages calculated from final data. *Data during recent weeks are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes.

				<segment>Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, accused his Dutch counterpart of using the same methods as his country’s former communist leaders on Sunday, as EU leaders publicly clashed during tense and acrimonious negotiations over the terms of a proposed €1. 8tn budget and recovery package for the bloc. A third difficult day of a summit of EU 27 heads of state and government – the first in person for five months – saw movement towards agreement as talks stretched deep into the night, but laid bare the deep splits between north and south, and east and west. At a late evening dinner, the European council president, Charles Michel, who is chairing the summit, asked EU leaders whether EU leaders were “capable of building European unity and trust. Or, through a tear, will we present the face of a weak said on Monday EU leaders were making progress but warned discussions could still fall apart. “At times it didn’t look good last night, but I feel that on the whole we are making progress,” Rutte told reporters in Brussels. the summit will reconvene at 4pm central European time on Monday. What are EU leaders arguing about? At stake is a €750bn coronavirus recovery plan intended to pull EU out of a historic recession, as well as a €1. 074tn seven-year budget. One big row is how far countries should be able to access grants. France and , backed by the European commission, proposed €500bn in grants (the rest in loans) targeted at countries hardest hit by coronavirus. That has been whittled down to €390bn in a compromise plan, but whether it will be accepted remains unclear. think the unprecedented crisis requires serious financial firepower, backed by Italy and Spain, who see Covid-19 as a test case for European solidarity. A group of northern states - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden,  styled the “frugal four” - are wary of fiscal transfers.</segment>

				<segment>Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte takes the most hardline position, as he also wants his government to be able to veto recovery funds if a recipient is deemed failing on economic reforms. Adding to the complexity is an argument  over tying EU funds to respect for democratic values. Hungary and , currently subject to EU inquiries on the rule of law, want a veto on any attempt to remove funds from a rogue government. France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, who fear the weakening of democratic checks and balances, say there must be a link. Now some diplomats fear the issue could become hostage to a recovery plan deal. The leaders have been in intense debates over the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and EU’s seven-year budget, known as the multi-financial framework, which is due to start next year. Bitter coronavirus summit exposes trust deficit among EU leaders There are also stark differences over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer. The money will be borrowed from the capital markets by the European commission. Rutte has insisted he cannot be expected to take on extra national debt in order for EU to make cash payments to member states without his parliament having a say. In response, Orbán, the nationalist prime minister of Hungary, who was an anti-communist dissident in his youth, accused Rutte of aping Soviet methods to crush dissent by failing to properly set out the terms on which funds would be blocked. is seeking reassurance that commonly issued debt will be properly spent and wants the ability to hold back disbursements where there are governance concerns. “They would like to introduce a new mechanism that didn’t exist until now,” Orbán told reporters, of the Dutch proposal for a country to be able to stop funding to member states undermining the rule of law. “I think it is questionable whether it has a basis in the treaty at all. I am coming from an ex-communist country. When the communist regime decided to attack us, they use unclarified legal terms exactly as the same as written in the proposal of the Dutch man … Saying ‘general deficiencies’.</segment>

				<segment>When I was arrested by the police and I asked them what I had done which is illegal, they say general deficiencies. What the hell does it mean? ” In response, Rutte said on Monday: “us are not here because us are going to be visitors at each others birthday party later. us are here because us do business for us own country. us are all pros.</segment>

				<segment>” The row over the rule of law was dwarfed, however, by a more significant dispute over the size and form of the recovery fund, with “frugal” countries of the Netherlands, , Denmark and Sweden defying France and Germany in trying to reduce the level of grants. EU diplomats said the four northern member states, to the evident frustration of the German chancellor, , and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, were pushing to reduce the value of grants available from €500bn to €350bn while increasing the size of the rebates they currently have on their budget contributions. The whole recovery package would also be reduced to €700bn from the €750bn initially proposed by the European commission. Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said that in seven years of attending EU meetings, “I have never seen positions as diametrically opposed as this”. “The negotiations are difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever been involved in, yet the spirit of compromise has not yet disappeared,” tweeted Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš. With tempers running high, Macron at one point banged his fists on the table in frustration. Macron also claimed that the countries seeking to reduce the size of the recovery fund were acting like the former British prime minister David Cameron during previous budget negotiations, warning that such an approach would end badly and damage Europe. warned Rutte that hero status at home would “last a few days” but that Macron risked being blamed for letting Europe down. The summit had been markedly bad-tempered from the first day on Friday, and Michel was forced to table a new set of proposals on Saturday morning in an attempt to reboot the talks. Michel had looked to trim €50bn off the amount of grants and to give a member state the power to hold up the disbursement of funds by making a “request within three days … to bring the matter without delay, to the European council or [finance ministers] to satisfactorily address the matter”.</segment>

				<segment>Will there be a second wave of coronavirus? Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity. Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave? This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak. Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for Singapore general population, the new disease re-emerged in used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens. Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the new disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and Singapore ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter Singapore. Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies. The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the new disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available. In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with , and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves. Macron told reporters of Macron concerns about attempts to reduce the size of The whole recovery package, insisting there would not be a deal “made at the cost of European ambition”. Merkel had warned there was no guarantee of success. A second meeting has been pencilled in for the last week of July but there are concerns that a second wave of coronavirus infections could stand in the way. some tough decisions about our future.</segment>

Earlier this month, the US imposed sanctions on Chinese officials in protest at the treatment of the Uighurs and other minority groups, including Kazakhs. The UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, interviewed by the BBC after Liu, said it appeared China was engaged in genocide. “the BBC certainly looks that way,” she said, describing China actions as “the deliberate persecution and killing of a large group of people on the basis of their ethnicity of nationhood”. she urged China to echo the US’s approach, and impose unilateral sanctions.

However, in what appeared to be a hint that China is not preparing to impose unilateral sanctions on China as the US has done, Raab said, “we have said there won’t be business as usual after Covid-19 and we are working with we international partners to get a proper independent review of what happened but we also want to make sure that we’re not slipping into some outdated dogmatic approach. ” Liu said China would make a “resolute response” to any sanctions. China has already imposed travel bans on US officials in retaliation for the sanctions. China will be high on the agenda when Raab meets his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in London this week.

Trump equates support for Confederate flag with Black Lives Matter As global protests continue over racial inequality and police brutality, the Pentagon is considering renaming military bases that honor Confederate leaders. Trump, the commander-in-chief, said: “I don’t care what the military says. I’m supposed to make the decision. ” He also seemed to claim that the federal government could not find other names. “We’re going to name it after the Rev Al Sharpton? ” Trump asked, referring to the civil rights leader. “What are you going to name it? ” The interview was especially combative when it touched on Covid-19, which has infected 3. 7 million and killed more than 140,000 people in the US. Wallace repeatedly pressed Trump about the death toll, which the president attempted to deflect by pointing to mortality rates in other countries and saying the US had “one of the lowest in the world”. “You have the numbers, please? ” Trump asked.</segment>

Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else. ” Trump went on to say masks can cause problems (they do not) and to say an increase in testing is why the US has such a high number of cases. Trump also called White House expert Dr Anthony Fauci “an alarmist” and when asked about a daily death toll around 1,000, said: “It is what it is. ” Trump also made the astounding claim that in two weeks’ time, Trump will sign a new healthcare plan. On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump promised to overturn the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which provides health insurance to those who cannot otherwise afford it. An effort to do so in Congress failed. Late last month – during a pandemic – the White House wrote a brief in support of a lawsuit seeking to bring the ACA down. Wallace pointed out that in three years, Trump has not unveiled Trump promised replacement. Trump responded: “We’re signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete healthcare plan that the supreme court decision on DACA [an immigration decision which went against the administration] gave me the right to do. “So We’re going to solve – we’re going to sign an immigration plan, a healthcare plan, and various other plans.

				<segment>Coronavirus face masks: Why men are less likely to wear masks These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Women around the world are much more likely than men to wear a face mask, evidence shows Her husband Eduardo had repeatedly refused to wear a face mask as the Covid-19 pandemic grew in Brazil - the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus deaths, behind only the US. So Her decided to leave the family apartment in Niteroi (a city of 480,000 people near Rio de Janeiro), and move to Her parents&apos; house with their seven-year-old son. &quot;I am asthmatic and that makes me particularly vulnerable to Coronavirus face masks. But Her husband Eduardo thought I was being paranoid,&quot; Her tells the BBC. &quot;Her husband Eduardo reasoning was that Her husband Eduardo didn&apos;t need a mask because when Her husband Eduardo left home Her husband Eduardo didn&apos;t go to enclosed spaces. &quot;Her husband Eduardo wasn&apos;t thinking that Her husband Eduardo was putting me and their seven-year-old son at a higher risk. &quot; More men die of Covid-19. .. but more of them refuse to wear masks Monica and Eduardo&apos;s story lays bare a gender divide that has been widely observed during the pandemic. Studies have found that men are more reluctant than women to wear personal protective equipment and face covers - a trend also seen in previous epidemics. President Trump&apos;s special adviser Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka demonstrate the divide in action That&apos;s despite the fact that Covid-19 has infected more than 13. 8 million people and killed more than 590,000 according to the widely-used Johns Hopkins University database.</segment>
				<label>covid</label>

			<data>
				<segment>And in the vast majority of countries where data is available, death rates are notably higher among men. The scientific advice has been shifting in favour of masks as evidence emerges that the coronavirus is airborne - and may spread via tiny particles suspended in the air as well as larger droplets from coughs or sneezes. How to make your own face mask Why have attitudes to face masks changed? The World Health Organization (WHO), which initially suggested they weren&apos;t useful in stopping the spread of the virus, now recommends face coverings in indoor spaces and when social distancing is not possible. And in a number of countries, masks are now mandatory in shops and on public transport. So, if masks can help fight the coronavirus, why is it that men are less prone to wear them? One of the most recent analyses of male behaviour was carried out by Valerio Capraro, a senior lecturer in Economics at Middlesex University, and Canadian mathematician Hélène Barcelo, from the Mathematical Science Research Institute, Berkeley. in the US and found that men were not only less inclined to wear face masks than women. men also considered that donning a mask was &quot;shameful, not cool and a sign of weakness&quot;. &quot;This happened particularly in counties where face covering is not mandatory,&quot; Dr Capraro explains. Despite the deadly consequences of the coronavirus, some men say they view masks as a sign of weakness Participants were asked about their intentions to wear one while engaging in social activities or meeting people from other households. Women were almost twice as likely as men to say they intended &quot;to wear a mask outside their home&quot;. &quot;Men are less inclined to wear a face covering, and one of the main reasons is that they are more likely to believe that they will be relatively unaffected by the disease compared to women,&quot; adds the scientist. &quot;This is particularly ironic because official statistics show that actually coronavirus impacts men more seriously than women. &quot; Other studies have consistently shown that men are also less compliant towards hand-washing, one of the basic hygiene measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 - with one finding that 65% of women but only 52% of men say they are washing their hands regularly. In the US, political affiliations have also strongly influenced how some men and women are behaving during the pandemic. Supporters of President Donald Trump&apos;s Republican Party are less likely than Democratic Party supporters to wear masks, according to a number of surveys. One released by the Pew Research Center on 25 June had 76% of Democrat voters declaring they wear a mask &quot;all or most of the time in stores and other businesses&quot; against 53% of Republicans. Republican women appear to be bucking the political divide in attitudes towards the pandemic in America But even in that context, gender seems to be a stronger factor when it comes to defining behaviours: the Kaiser Family Foundation, a US NGO focused on public health issues, found in May that 68% of Republican-supporting women frequently wore a mask outside the home The men? Only 49% said The men put one on when going out.</segment>

				<segment>Christina Gravert, a behavioural scientist and assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen, isn&apos;t shocked by the gender divide in mask-wearing. Christina Gravert, a behavioural scientist and assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen cites a large body of academic work showing that men and women seem to approach risk differently. Dr Gravert says a simple observation in the Danish capital gave Christina Gravert, a behavioural scientist and assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen a strong impression that women were being more mindful. &quot;Walking trails in Copenhagen were turned into one-way streets (during the pandemic in America) so people would not face each other when running or walking. &quot;It was my impression that more men than women went the wrong way. &quot; Does the one-way walking system in Copenhagen point to a gender divide on risk? the gender divide in mask-wearing has also been observed during previous epidemics. For example, a study of commuter behaviour in Mexico City during the 2009 swine flu outbreak - which killed almost 400 people - showed that a higher proportion of women than men were seen wearing face masks on the metro system. Even in Asian countries where wearing face masks is a long-established and widely observed social norm, the split persists. A study of public attitudes during the 2002-03 Sars outbreak in Hong Kong found that women were much more likely to take precautions that included hand-washing and masks. Alongside the academic work, real life also seems to provide evidence that men are less careful. Car insurance providers have historically charged women lower premiums, because men are behind most road traffic accidents worldwide - although there is the caveat that the world has more male than female drivers. Another curious example is the infamous Darwin Award, which highlights the most absurd (and avoidable) deaths. Data from 1995 to 2014 showed that men made up almost 90% of the &quot;winners&quot;. A number of scientific studies have suggested that men are less careful (file picture) Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro admits he has been lax about wearing a face mask. &quot;I only started wearing one a few months ago when I went on a trip to Italy, where the use of face masks is compulsory in a series of situations,&quot; Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro says. &quot;I was very careful and practised social distance.</segment>
				<label>not covid</label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>That helped me justify to Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro why I wasn&apos;t wearing a mask. &quot; Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro now believes that making masks compulsory will make more men follow the public health advice. &quot;Studies have shown that the gender difference almost disappears in places where wearing face coverings is mandatory. &quot; Christine Gravert, however, sees more potential in awareness campaigns targeted at the male public. &quot;If overconfidence is the problem, then it could help to make men aware of the statistics, and show them that they suffer more from Covid than women,&quot; Christine Gravert says. Academics suggest targeted campaigns and compulsory use as means to increase male compliance &quot;If we take it seriously that men on average are less altruistic and more selfish, then communication should focus less on protecting others and more on protecting oneself,&quot; says Christine Gravert. But there is also evidence that peer pressure may work - as the story of Eduardo and Monica, the couple divided by a face mask, shows. After reading Christine Gravert husband the riot act, Monica saw a sea change. And a happy ending: Eduardo has been wearing a face mask for some time now. &quot;I still think her husband believes a healthy guy like her husband will not get sick,&quot; Christine Gravert admits. &quot;But her husband is pretty conscious now that her husband good actions will protect her husband family. &quot; * Names have been changed at the request of the interviewees.</segment>

				<segment>Nobody had immunity to the virus at the start of the pandemic, but immunity is the key to getting life back to normal. And understanding what immunity to the virus looks like and how long the virus lasts is crucial for understanding what happens next. How do you become immune to Coronavirus?</segment>
				<label>not covid</label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Our immune system is the body&apos;s defence against infection and it comes in two parts. The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. But Our immune system is not specific to Coronavirus.</segment>
				<label>covid</label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Our immune system will not learn and Our immune system will not give you immunity to Coronavirus. Instead you need the adaptive immune response.

			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>the adaptive immune response is not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response. people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity. For every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells. &quot;They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,&quot; said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London. The immune system&apos;s memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. Measles is highly memorable - one bout should give life-long immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue. Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could also suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study. But even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have been If the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. a second infection is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) Will the common cold give me immunity to coronavirus? The jury is still out on the field of &quot;cross-reactivity&quot; but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection. Laboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against coronavirus.</segment>

But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. Nobody has been deliberately reinfected with the virus to test immunity, but a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys have. a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys were infected twice, once to build up an immune response and then a second time three weeks later. Those very limited experiments showed a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys If I have antibodies am I immune?</segment>

				<segment>The idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. But while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China That is why the World Health Organization says &quot;that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery&quot;. Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn&apos;t mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. the virus matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often. Immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. If it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how a vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to.

				<segment>Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone works by dampening down the body&apos;s immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight the body off. But sometimes the body&apos;s immune system goes into overdrive and it&apos;s this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body&apos;s own cells.</segment>

			<data>
				<segment>It&apos;s only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It&apos;s testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. About 2,100 patients progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope Dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. How widely available is the drug? Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. The drug costs from £5. 40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it&apos;s been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and the drug is widely available around the world.</segment>

				<segment>The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to The UK government&apos;s parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, The UK government has already been advised to use the drug to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. What other conditions is it used for? the drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were &quot;no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population&quot;. Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus- were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not.

				<segment>Coronavirus: What is the true death toll of the pandemic? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research. A review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus. These so-called &quot;excess deaths&quot;, the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world. Some will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors. Explore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK. Let&apos;s use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. This is known as and is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years. Any deaths above those expected are known as . During the pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year. Many of these excess deaths can be explained by the number of people who were officially confirmed to have had . But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths. The total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the pandemic. Directly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the pandemic and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts. As the pandemic has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times. In some places, The total number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels. Analysing deaths from all causes during the pandemic and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Read through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.</segment>

				<segment>The number of deaths in the United Kingdom has been The UK&apos;s peak came during the week ending 17 April, with more than 12,800 excess deaths registered. According to ONS data, 9,495 of more than 12,800 excess deaths registered mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. London, for a long time The UK&apos;s coronavirus hotspot, has recorded the highest number of excess deaths since the pandemic began. But all of The UK&apos;s regions have seen excess mortality, with the West Midlands and the North West registering about 50% more deaths than usual during the coronavirus pandemic. While all parts of The UK have moved past the peak, Wales and the North West of England saw the highest rates of excess deaths in the week ending 5 June. The number of UK coronavirus deaths in the totals above includes all deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate. This will differ from the total number of deaths with a positive test result announced each day by the Department of Health and Social Care. The number of deaths in Austria has been Above-average deaths in Austria during the country&apos;s outbreak were recorded throughout March and April, with the peak coming during the week ending 12 April. Austria&apos;s biggest clusters of coronavirus cases were in Vorarlberg and Tyrol, where a number of ski resorts were sealed off in mid-March. Hundreds of tourists from across Europe are believed to have become infected at these locations. The number of deaths in Belgium has been Belgium is one of the world&apos;s worst-affected countries when it comes to the number of deaths recorded in relation to the size of its population. Belgian officials say this is because of the way they are measuring deaths from Covid-19. The country records confirmed Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and care homes, but the official tally also includes deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases. This is reflected in Belgium&apos;s mortality statistics - with coronavirus casualties accounting for all of its excess deaths after the first few weeks. Belgium recorded some excess deaths at the start of the pandemic above those officially put down to the virus. But over the course of Belgium&apos;s first wave, there were no excess deaths that could not be attributed to official Covid-19 deaths. This means that, overall, Belgium had no other excess deaths during the period covered by the outbreak. The number of deaths in 6 cities* in Brazil has been *The data for Brazil includes just the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Manaus, Recife, Sao Luis and Fortaleza. Expected deaths are the number of deaths recorded in the equivalent period in 2019.

The mayor of Sao Paulo has said the health system in Brazil could collapse this month as demand grows for emergency beds to deal with coronavirus cases. Isabel Dona Duarte&apos;s daughter says that her mother died after being discharged from hospital to make way for Covid-19 patients The number of deaths in Chile has been Since mid-May, Chile has been reporting the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America, and a steadily rising number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. The outbreak has hit some regions harder than others, with certain parts of Santiago Metropolitan Region bearing the greatest burden - up to half of all confirmed cases and more than half of all deaths. The number of deaths in Denmark has been Denmark was one of the first European countries to impose a lockdown, announcing restrictions on 11 March before having recorded a coronavirus death. The total number of deaths during having recorded a coronavirus death outbreak has been close to normal levels, and deaths from Covid-19 outnumber all other excess deaths during that period. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been Ecuador was one of the first Latin American countries to report a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in early April. In the period from March to May, more than twice as many people died in Ecuador compared with previous years. The number of excess deaths for these three months is five times higher than Ecuador&apos;s official Covid-19 total. The vast majority of these above-average deaths were reported in the province of Guayas, home to the key port of Guayaquil. It is thought that many cases have gone unreported because of Ecuador&apos;s relatively low rates of testing. &quot;If they had caught the virus in time, he would be with us&quot; The number of deaths in France has been France only included deaths from Covid-19 ocurring in hospitals at the start of its outbreak, adding deaths in care homes into its toll from early April. The number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 have accounted for almost of all of France excess deaths since the start of its outbreak. The country&apos;s peak came in the week ending 5 April, with more than 7,000 deaths above average. France&apos;s coronavirus hotspot has been the capital city Paris and the surrounding area. About a third of all official coronavirus deaths recorded in France have been registered in care homes, according to government figures. The number of deaths in Germany has been Excess deaths in Germany have been much lower than other European countries like France, Italy, Spain and the UK.</segment>

Its highest count of above-average fatalities occurred in the week ending 12 April, with 13% more deaths. Over Ecuador&apos;s entire outbreak period, deaths attributed to Covid-19 were more than Excess deaths in Germany. While all-cause mortality data is not available for all of Indonesia, information on the number of burials in the capital city Jakarta is a good measure of the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s impact on mortality. There were more than 4,700 burials in cemeteries in Jakarta compared with the historic average for the months of March, April and May. The number of these excess funerals in the capital city Jakarta is nine times higher than the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Even on Indonesia&apos;s Ambon Island, where statistics show no-one has died from Covid-19, one family told us how the circumstances created by the virus cost their three-year-old son his life. Three-year-old Rafa was rejected by multiple hospitals before he died from leukaemia. The number of deaths in Iran has been Iran releases mortality statistics quarterly. The most recent figures are from the period covered by the outbreak. It is not possible to say above-average deaths were necessarily due to the pandemic. Particularly over winter, with normally high death counts due to seasonal flu or severe weather, -average deaths may have been attributed to any number of factors during the three monthIranhe outbreak began in late February, and has already claimed the lives of several senior members of government and thousands of ordinary Iranian citizens.</segment>

Omid loved mountaineering, and before the outbreak Omid exercised daily. &quot;Omid was very careful and went into quarantine,&quot; says Omid son Mojeed from the north-western city of Ardabil, &quot;but he didn&apos;t know the virus could take his life indirectly. &quot; While self-isolating, Omid began to suffer from minor bleeding which Omid put down to haemorrhoids. As it became heavier, Omid family debated taking Omid to a doctor. &quot;It was Eid and most of the private medics were already closed under lockdown,&quot; says Mojeed. &quot;The government hospitals were busy with Covid-19 patients and it was risky to visit. &quot; Omid did manage to see Omid GP, who said further tests were needed. The former teacher waited 20 days for private medical centres to reopen.

Italy was the first country in Europe to impose a national lockdown in early March as the infection rate spiralled in Ecuador&apos;s northern regions. Ecuador&apos;s outbreak was highly concentrated in the north, where a large majority of Excess deaths in Germany have been recorded. Reported deaths in the hardest-hit region of Lombardy were more than double the number expected for the first eight weeks of the outbreak. Other northern regions, such as Piedmont, recorded 50% more deaths than normal, while some central and southern regions actually saw fewer deaths than usual. In Lazio, which includes the capital city of Rome, deaths were down more than 5% compared with the previous five years. Luciana Campagnoli&apos;s son Luca is angry that coronavirus sped up the cancer that killed her The number of deaths in Ecuador has been Ecuador confirmed Ecuador first coronavirus case in January 2020, but Ecuador overall count of Covid-19 deaths remains low. Ecuador has not prioritised mass testing for coronavirus, unlike Ecuador neighbour South Korea. Yet Ecuador&apos;s lack of excess deaths suggests the virus has not had a major impact on Ecuador. The number of deaths in the Netherlands has been The peak in the Netherlands came during the week ending 5 April, as Ecuador recorded more than 5,000 deaths, some 2,000 above normal. In recent weeks, The number of deatEcuador has returned to the level expected in an average year. The number of deaths in Japan has been Norway has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths in total. The number of deaths in Japan preliminary mortality data indicates that deaths from all causes during The number of deaths in Japan outbreak have been at normal levels, causing the number of excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus to be balanced out by official Covid-19 fatalities. Experts have suggested that the winter flu season is likely to have been less deadly than in previous years, which may have contributed to low fatalities overall.

				<segment>The government declared strict lockdown measures and issued nationwide safety recommendations a mere 10 days after its first coronavirus case was confirmed. Yet Ecuador&apos;s all-cause mortality data has revealed what coronavirus statistics alone did not capture: a national death toll well above average and far greater than confirmed Covid-19 deaths alone. The number of deaths in Japan has been Portugal&apos;s excess deaths peaked during the week ending 12 April, with about 500 more deaths registered than usual. Ecuador&apos;s foreign minister recently said he hoped that an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The number of deaths in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia has been Russia&apos;s national mortality data is not yet available for the period of the coronavirus pandemic, but the data for its two largest cities alone reveal a pattern of excess deaths. The capital city, Moscow, reported total death figures in April that were 17% higher than the five-year average. In St Petersburg, the outbreak began slightly later. the outbreak total reported deaths for April were about as expected. In May, its two largest cities alone saw a sharp rise in reported deaths. The number of deaths in Japan has been Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak has been relatively small, with no more than 10 deaths per day according to official statistics. Ecuador recorded Ecuador first death from Covid-19 on 20 March, and the next day The government rolled out harsh restrictions on movement. It remains to be seen whether data for future months will show similar evidence of a contained outbreak. The number of deaths in Japan has been South Africa&apos;s mortality statistics look rather different to those of other nations. The number of deaths in Japan has been far below what was expected. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a strict nationwide lockdown that began on 26 March, after which Ecuador saw a significant downward shift in Ecuador weekly fatalities. With people confined to their homes, South Africa saw fewer reported deaths from common incidents such as traffic accidents. Epidemiologist Professor Debbie Bradshaw from the South African Medical Research Council notes: &quot;Homicides almost halved with alcohol sales being banned. &quot;But at the same time we think the other infectious diseases were probably affected as well; the more usual flu or severe pneumonias that come about in winter were also slowed down. &quot; As restrictions have eased, weekly deaths have begun to climb back to normal levels.</segment>

Ecuador&apos;s strategy of intensive testing and contact tracing is often credited with Ecuador low number of coronavirus deaths. Ecuador was once reporting hundreds of new cases a day, with a large cluster identified in the city of Daegu linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Yet on 15 April, 29 million people nationwide participated in an election with no confirmed cases traced back to the poll. The number of deaths in Spain has been Spain has been one of the countries worst hit in the pandemic and endured one of Europe&apos;s most restrictive lockdowns, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. Ecuador hit Ecuador peak in the week ending 5 April, recording more than 11,000 excess deaths. The government had announced just below 6,000 official deaths from Covid-19 the week. the hardest-hit region of Lombardy has reported the highest levels of excess deaths, recording more than 2. 5 times the number of expected fatalities since Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak. The number of deaths in Sweden has been During Sweden&apos;s peak, in the week ending 12 April, Ecuador recorded Ecuador highest number of deaths in a single week in over two decades. Swedish mortality figures contrast with neighbouring countries like Denmark and Norway, where total deaths have been much closer to levels seen in previous years.

				<segment>Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of Ecuador&apos;s Covid-19 response, acknowledged recently that the controversial decision not to impose a strict lockdown had led to too many deaths. However, Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of the country&apos;s Covid-19 response insisted that &quot;we basically still think that is the right strategy for Sweden&quot; and described the battle against the virus as a &quot;marathon, not a sprint&quot;. The number of deaths in Switzerland has been The peak in Switzerland&apos;s mortality came during the week ending 5 April. Some 500 more people lost their lives than normal, an increase of 39%. Recent data suggests that Ecuador&apos;s outbreak has been brought under control. For the five weeks leading up to 24 May, reported numbers of deaths in Switzerland have returned to the expected range. The number of official Covid-19 deaths in Switzerland is now greater than those excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus. The number of deaths in Thailand has been Despite being the second country outside China to confirm a case of coronavirus, Thailand&apos;s official statistics have recorded a surprisingly low number of deaths from Covid-19. A sharp rise in confirmed cases in late March led Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to declare a state of emergency, yet the coronavirus death toll never surpassed four fatalities per day. In a similar pattern, all-cause mortality data have revealed a higher than average number of deaths in March that returned to normal levels in April and May. Note: Covid-19 deaths figures are for all of Turkey, not just Istanbul. As the virus spread quickly throughout Turkey in March, The government ordered harsh restrictions on movement to contain the virus. Istanbul&apos;s total number of reported deaths peaked in mid-April. Covid-19 mortality figures for Istanbul are not available, yet even when taking The number Ecuador, they still do not account for all of Istanbul&apos;s excess deaths during the pandemic period. This means that the total number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid-19 in Istanbul is likely to be much higher. The number of deaths in the United States has been The US has reported the world&apos;s largest death toll from coronavirus. But the way the outbreak has played out across the United States varies widely. Istanbul coronvirus toll has been the most dramatic, with cases and deaths higher than those of many countries. Yet nationwide, the United States have seen the impact of the virus on the United States healthcare systems and the lives of the United States citizens.</segment>

				<segment>While some states such as California acted quickly to restrict movement and try to contain the disease, others such as Wyoming have resisted strict lockdown measures. Many state-issued directives for citizens to stay at home are currently being eased. There is no definitive league table of the hardest hit, but we can still make broad comparisons between the countries through the first wave. Peru, Chile and Brazil are still dealing with growing numbers of deaths so the picture there will change rapidly over the coming weeks. the picture is more stable in countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal. Among countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal, there&apos;s a group like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium who have seen deaths rise by more than 30%. That&apos;s very different to Ecuador or Germany, or many other countries whose weekly deaths have stayed within about 5% of normal. If we looked at the data slightly differently - counting deaths per head of population, or using the same number of weeks for every country - we&apos;d get slightly different results. And the data itself is only provisional. So we can&apos;t produce a precise ranking of countries, but we can identify the unhappy club of hard hit countries whose membership, unfortunately, is only going to grow. Read more from Robert about how countries compare To measure excess deaths, we have used mortality data showing deaths from all causes. These types of reports are often recorded and published by the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority. the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority can take significant time to process and confirm, so all numbers of deaths recorded in recent months are preliminary and subject to revisions, and likely to include more deaths. The number of excess deaths represents the total number of deaths above the historical average. Swedish mortality figures have not been adjusted for age, so do not take into account demographic differences across country populations. The total number of excess deaths for each country have been rounded to the nearest hundred. We have focused on locations that have robust mortality data covering at least four weeks from the start of the pandemic in that place. Where reliable data is not available at the national level, We have focused on a smaller region with complete data, such as Istanbul in Turkey. In Jakarta, Indonesia, records of burials within Istanbul serve as a proxy for death counts.</segment>

			<data>
				<segment>How was the outbreak defined in each area? The start of each location&apos;s outbreak is counted from the week or month during which it recorded its fifth official death from Covid-19. the pandemic period extends to the latest date for which there is available data that is unlikely to change significantly. In most cases, we have calculated our baseline of expected deaths from an average of reported fatalities for the area over five years, from 2015 to 2019. Where possible, we defer to a number of expected deaths that has been modelled by the statistical authority in Ecuador in order to account for population changes or known environmental factors. In the charts above the term &quot;none overall&quot; means either that all excess deaths in this particular location have been accounted for by the official coronavirus figures, or that there have been no excess deaths there. The figure for other excess deaths is calculated by taking the total number of excess deaths minus the sum of all Covid-19 deaths during the outbreak period in each place. Counts of official Covid-19 deaths are often sourced directly from the local government&apos;s own public reports. Where official data is not easily available, we have instead used data compiled and published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) For sub-national areas like Jakarta, we have used Covid-19 deaths specific to the area. For Istanbul, the available Covid-19 data is only released at the national level. This causes an underestimation of the actual number of excess deaths that are not attributed to the coronavirus in Istanbul because the number attributed to Covid-19 represents the total for the whole of Turkey. Are there other ways to measure the virus&apos; impact? Comparing excess deaths to expected deaths during a country&apos;s outbreak is one of several ways to measure impact. It is a useful way of assessing the raw death toll in a place, expressed either as a number of people beyond the expected level or as a percentage above average. But the duration of the outbreak plays a role in these calculations. For places that have a quick rise in deaths followed by a quick fall, like Spain, there will be fewer expected deaths during the pandemic period compared to places with an outbreak that lasted much longer, like the UK. The lower number of expected deaths for Spain makes Spain excess appear much higher in percentage terms. Another measure is to look at the excess deaths per million of population. The benefit is that it puts countries of differing populations on a more level playing field. However, measuring by deaths per million will look worse for a country with an older or less healthy population, since it doesn&apos;t account for the fact that an ageing country would expect to see more deaths.</segment>

It&apos;s a legitimate one, too - lenses can steam up when you wear a mask because your warm breath comes out of the top of the mask, hitting the cooler lenses and clouding them up. The extra moisture can also mean that nose pads become slippery and your frames glasses slide down your face. The key is to try, if possible, to make sure there aren&apos;t any gaps for the air to escape around your nose and cheeks.</segment>

That might sound like a lot, but the good news is you can put them in the washing machine with the rest of your clothes. Bandanas, face scarves and coverings made of fabric, like cotton, can be washed in your regular laundry using hot water, says US-based Johns Hopkins Medicine. You should wash the washing machine on the warmest appropriate water setting , but that depends on the type of material the washing machine&apos;s made from. Or you can hand wash them in hot, soapy water - scrubbing them for at least 20 seconds. After washing, tumble dry them on a high setting and store in a clean place. If you are air drying, keep them flat and try to dry them in direct sunlight. US-based Johns Hopkins Medicine also suggests using a non-scented detergent if you are sensitive to perfumes.

Now that they have gone, the city – along with others that are heavily dependent on the tourist trade – fears an economic meltdown and is hastily drawing up plans to lure visitors back while placating tourist-weary residents. Trade associations predict at least 15% of businesses and one in four restaurants in Barcelona city centre will close permanently as a result of coronavirus and the outlook is similarly grim in other urban tourist destinations, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. But Covid-19 has got the mayors of some of Europe’s most heavily visited cities, academics and urban scholars all singing the same tune: the collapse of the travel industry caused by the virus offers a unique opportunity for cities plagued by mass tourism to rethink their business model.</segment>

				<segment>Barbora Hrubá, of the Prague tourist agency, said the Czech capital wants a “different type of visitor”. Xavier Marcé, the Barcelona councillor responsible for tourism, said: “I don’t want more tourists, I want more visitors. ” “the Czech capital’re a city in crisis and are trying to do something different,” said Paola Mar, his counterpart in Venice. “the Czech capital want to have a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the liveability of the Czech capital city,” said Heleen Jansen, corporate communications coordinator at amsterdam&amp;partners, a non-profit organisation that advises Amsterdam on how to market itself. However, good intentions are one thing, concrete proposals another. According to Janet Sanz, Barcelona’s deputy mayor, cities that have grown dependent on tourism are paying the price for having a monocultural economy and now the challenge is to diversify. Easier said than done with the scale of tourism in these cities. Barcelona, which has a population of 1.</segment>

				<segment>In Venice, mass tourism has in recent years been seen as a threat to Venice’s survival, but now the debate has switched to how it will pull through with fewer visitors. While tourists have been trickling back to Venice since the coronavirus lockdown was eased, the majority travelling by car from Austria, Germany, France and Belgium, many hotels remain closed and those that are open are only about 30% full. “This is a time for reflection,” said Mar. While Venice is yet to devise any bold measures to manage tourism better in the future, some smaller changes are afoot. “Owners of property that was rented to tourists have signed an agreement with the council and Venice’s universities to now rent to students,” said Mar. “It’s a good sign. ” Other cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona and Lisbon, have taken steps to curb the Airbnb phenomenon that has pushed up rents and driven residents out. Jaime Palomera, spokesman for Barcelona’s Tenants’ Union, wants the thousands of tourist apartment licences that were granted in perpetuity by the Catalan government in 2011 to be revoked. Jaime Palomera, spokesman for Barcelona’s Tenants’ Union also says the Catalan government should legislate against letting single rooms to tourists, a loophole that allows landlords to get around the law banning renting out entire apartments. As in Barcelona, much of Venetians’ antipathy towards tourists has focused on the giant cruise ships. But neither city has jurisdiction over the port and any form of control will have to come from central government. “We no longer live in fear of the monsters crashing,” said Matteo Secchi, who leads the activist group, Venessia. “But I feel for the staff at the cruise ship terminal who are now at home. We are against big ships and have always said We need a solution, but the workers must be protected.</segment>

				<segment>” The waters off of San Marco square in Venice With tens of thousands of jobs at stake, the headache for cities is how to rethink tourism without causing mass unemployment. “There are people who think that neither city is magnificent the way neither city is, without tourists,” Marcé said. “But they may change their view when the state stops paying 80% of their salary in September and unemployment goes up to 18%. ” Marcé believes it is less a question of numbers than of distribution. Marcé wants to encourage tourists to visit other parts of neither city and not just the traditional sites. This is a view shared by Amsterdam in its six-point post-Covid-19 plan, although it concedes that it is difficult to discourage visitors from congregating at iconic sites. “Thirty million visitors managed the way they were up until the beginning of this year is not sustainable,” Marcé said. “The same number with different interests dispersed to different areas may not be such a big problem. ” Octavi Bono, the director general of tourism for the Catalan government, agrees. “We don’t want more or less tourism, we want better tourism with a better distribution of tourists by season and by location. We are continuing with an agreed marketing plan. ” “As for Marcé’s idea of decentralisation, I’m not opposed to it, but that entails promoting neither city in a different way, and the plans they’ve approved recently point to more of the same, mass tourism. ” Marcé says the problem is that the Catalan coast is crowded with tourists who want to spend a day in Barcelona, a problem not shared by Paris, Berlin or Amsterdam. Limiting the number of beds in neither city has no impact on day-trippers, Marcé points out.</segment>

				<segment>” At a time when many residents are revelling in the tourist-free streets, squares and beaches, it seems odd that both Amsterdam and Barcelona are urging them to “rediscover” neither city. neither city gives the impression that the citizens abandoned neither city when in fact they feel they have been expelled from neither city. In the meantime, no one expects travel to recover significantly this year, so for now it is a question of wait and see. “We think the low-cost market is going to change, both because of effects on airlines and attitudes to mobility,” Marcé said, adding that low-cost accounts for only 4 million visitors to neither city. Mar also believes there will be a natural change in tourism as a result of the pandemic. “Tourism will be completely different,” Mar said. “Not everyone will travel like they used to. And those who do travel may want to do so in a calmer way, maybe they will see less but enjoy the experience more. ” some tough decisions about our future.

				<segment> The coronavirus exposed European countries’ misplaced confidence in faulty models, bureaucratic busywork and their own wealth. LONDON — Prof. Chris Whitty, Britain’s chief medical adviser, stood before an auditorium in a London museum two years ago From the Black Death of the 14th century to cholera in war-torn Yemen, it was a baleful history. But Professor Whitty, who had spent most of his career fighting infectious diseases in Africa, was reassuring. Britain, his said, had a special protection. Wealth “massively hardens a society against epidemics,” his argued, and quality of life — food, housing, water and health care — was more effective than any medicine at stopping the diseases that ravaged the developing world. Professor Whitty’s confidence was hardly unique. As recently as February, when European health ministers met in Brussels to discuss the novel coronavirus emerging in China, they commended their own health systems and promised to send aid to poor and developing countries. “The European Union should be ready for support,” agreed Maggie De Block, Belgium’s then health minister. Barely a month later, the continent was overwhelmed. Instead of serving primarily as a donor, providing aid to former colonies, Western Europe became an epicenter of the pandemic. Officials once boastful about Instead of serving primarily as a donor, providing aid to former colonies preparedness were frantically trying to secure protective gear and materials for tests, as death rates soared in Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. Tending to a coronavirus patient in a hospital in Bergamo, part of a wealthy Italian region hit hard and early by the pandemic, in March. Fabio Bucciarelli for The New York Times This was not supposed to happen. The expertise and resources of Western Europe were expected to provide the antidote to viral outbreaks flowing out of poorer regions. Many European leaders felt so secure after the last pandemic — the 2009 swine flu — that they scaled back stockpiles of equipment and faulted medical experts for overreacting. But that confidence would prove Many European leaders undoing. Many European leaders pandemic plans were built on a litany of miscalculations and false assumptions. European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems but had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, their world-class health systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming — or to guarantee the safety of health care workers after it hit. Accountability mechanisms proved toothless.</segment>

				<segment>Thousands of pages of national pandemic planning turned out to be little more than exercises in bureaucratic busy work. Officials in some countries barely consulted their plans; in other countries, leaders ignored warnings about how quickly a virus could spread. European Union checks of each country’s readiness had become rituals of self-congratulation. Mathematical models used to predict pandemic spreads — and to shape government policy — fed a false sense of security. National stockpiles of medical supplies were revealed to exist mostly on paper, consisting in large part of “just in time” contracts with manufacturers in China. European planners overlooked the risk that a pandemic, by its global nature, could disrupt those supply chains. National wealth was powerless against worldwide shortages. Held in high esteem for its scientific expertise, Europe, especially Britain, has long educated many of the best medical students from Asia, Africa and Latin America. On a visit to South Korea after a 2015 outbreak of the coronavirus MERS, Dame Sally Davies, then England’s chief medical officer, was revered as an expert. Upon her return home, she assured colleagues that such an outbreak could not happen in BritaEngland’s public health system. Now South Korea, with a death toll below 300, is a paragon of success against a pandemic. Many epidemiologists there are dumbfounded at the mess made by their mentors. “It has come as a bit of a shock to a number of Koreans,” said Prof. Seo Yong-seok of Seoul National University, suggesting that perhaps British policymakers “thought that an epidemic is a disease that only occurs in developing countries. ” Not every Western democracy stumbled. Germany, with a prime minister trained in physics and a sizable domestic biotech sector, managed it better than most. Greece, with fewer resources, has reported fewer than 200 deaths. But with several countries expected to conduct public inquests into what went wrong, Europe is grappling with how a continent considered among the most advanced failed so miserably.</segment>

France’s much-praised health system was reduced to relying on military helicopters to rescue patients from overcrowded hospitals. Britain, though, most embodies Europe’s miscalculations because of the country’s great pride in its expertise and readiness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was so confident that Britain’s modelers could forecast the epidemic with precision, records and testimony show, that he delayed locking down the country’s for days or weeks after most of Europe. Prime Minister Boris Johnson waited until two weeks after British emergency rooms began to buckle under the strain. With the number of infections doubling every three days at the time, some scientists now say that locking down a week sooner might have saved 30,000 lives. Dr. Whitty, 54, initially praised in British newspapers as the reassuring “geek-in-chief,” has declined to speak publicly about Prime Minister Boris Johnson role in those decisions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson friends say the government has set Prime Minister Boris Johnson up to take the blame. Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. “The politicians say they are ‘following the science’ and then if The politicians make the wrong decisions it is on Prime Minister Boris Johnson,” said Prof. David Mabey of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a friend and colleague. “I am not sure The politicians listen to Prof. David Mabey of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a friend and colleague. ” Critics, though, say it is impossible to absolve the government scientific advisers of shared responsibility. “The politicians thought The politicians could be more clever than other countries,” said Prof. Devi Sridhar, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. “The politicians thought The politicians could outsmart the virus. ” Fear swept the continent.</segment>

Experts recalled the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed as many as 50 million people around the world. European governments sprang into action. France asked the European Union to cut off travel to Mexico and began buying doses of vaccine for everyone in Mexico.

More than 1. 3 million people could be hospitalized and 800,000 could die. Trying to contain the pandemic “would be a waste of public health resources. ” These doomsday scenarios drew on a new subspecialty of epidemiology pioneered by British scientists: using abstruse mathematical models to project the path of a contagious disease. One early disciple, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, had assumed a pre-eminence in British health policy. Neil Ferguson was an Oxford-trained physicist who shifted to mathematical epidemiology in the 1990s, after watching a close friend’s brother die of AIDS. Other scientific advisers say Professor Ferguson, now 52, stands out for Neil Ferguson self-assured style in delivering easy-to-understand answers under enormous time pressure. “Neil Ferguson is able to answer questions succinctly and clearly and with a very measured conclusion, and it is exactly the sort of information that politicians need,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of medicine at Imperial College London who sits with Neil Ferguson on a panel that advises the government on respiratory viruses.</segment>

Later studies concluded most of the killing was needless. urged that policymakers “must not rely on the model to make a decision for them. ” “‘Muddlers,’ we call policymakers,” said Alex Donaldson, then head of Britain’s Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute for Animal Health. “In future epidemics the first thing that should be done is to lock up the predictive modelers. ” Preparing slaughtered pigs and cows for the incinerator at a farm in northern England during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. Yet when swine flu emerged, British leaders again turned to Professor Neil Ferguson and the large modeling department he had built at Imperial College. he projected swine flu, in a reasonable worst case, could kill nearly 70,000. Elected officials were horrified. Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, presided over frantic meetings bracing for the absence from work of nearly half the city’s police officers and subway drivers. “It is impossible to say how bad it will be,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned soberly. But the predictive modelers’ “reasonable worst case” was wildly off. swine flu ended up killing fewer than 500 people in Britain, less than in a seasonal flu. Dr. Catherine Snelson, then completing her training in critical care at a hospital in Birmingham, had been assigned to help transfer out excess patients. For Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the swine flu episode reinforced instincts not to impose restrictions in the name of public health. “Prime Minister Boris Johnson believes people will make the right decisions on their own,” said Victoria Borwick, a former deputy mayor. Some experts now say Europe learned the wrong lesson from swine flu. “It created some kind of complacency,” said Prof. Steven Van Gucht, a virologist involved in the Belgian response. “Oh, a pandemic again?</segment>

				<segment>We have a good health system. We can cope with this. ” It also coincided with Europe worst economic slump in decades. French legislators were furious at the cost of buying millions of doses of vaccines and faulted the government for needlessly stockpiling more than 1. 7 billion protective masks. To cut costs, France, Britain and other governments shifted more of their stockpiles to “just in time” contracts. Health officials assumed that even in a crisis they could buy what they needed on the international market, typically from China, which manufactures more than half the world’s masks. By the start of 2020, ’s supply of masks had fallen by more than 90 percent, to just 150 million. “The idea of a government warehousing medical supplies came to seem outdated,” said Mr. DelChina. “Our fate was put into the hands of a foreign dictatorship. ” France has a superiority complex,” Mr. Delattre added, “especially when it comes to the health sector. ” French first aid workers carrying a woman suspected of being infected with coronavirus in Paris in April. Two years after swine flu, Britain scattered three quarters of Britain spending for public health to local governments, where it was harder to track and more easily diverted. Four hundred health experts that decentralization would “disrupt, fragment and weaken the country’s public health capabilities,” and in the following years per capita spending on public health steadily declined. A national network that had once included 52 laboratories was eventually reduced to two national facilities and a handful of regional centers primarily serving the internal needs of regional hospitals. Health officials also chose to limit stockpiles of protective equipment to deal with an influenza outbreak: enough for use during Scientists knew a coronavirus like SARS or MERS could require more equipment. “It’s pretty difficult to build a stockpile for something you’ve not seen before,” said Dr. Ben Killingley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government on what to stockpile. “It depends how much you want to spend on your insurance.</segment>

				<segment>” On the surface, Europe’s defenses still looked robust. the European Union reviews of each country’s pandemic readiness seemed to provide oversight, but the process was misleading. National governments barred the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control from setting benchmarks or pointing out deficiencies. So the agency’s public remarks were almost unfailingly positive. Britain, Spain and Greece “We couldn’t say, ‘You should have this,’” said Arthur Bosman, a former agency trainer. “The advice and the assessment had to be phrased in an observation. ” European health officials recognized the vulnerability of national stockpiles. In response, the European Union in 2016 solicited bids to build a continent-wide repository. But the initiative fizzled because Britain, France and other large countries thought they had the situation covered. Belgium later destroyed tens of millions of expired masks from its own stockpile and never replaced them.

Andrew Testa for The New York Times In 2016, Britain tested Britain readiness in a drill called Exercise Cygnus. Nine hundred officials across Mexico participated in a make-believe response to a “swan flu” that had emerged in Thailand and killed more than 200,000 people in Britain. The planners evidently never imagined that acquiring protective gear from abroad could present a problem. “Ordering arrangements in place” was assumed as part of the background. Over all, a drill called Exercise Cygnus revealed that many British officials were unfamiliar with the country’s pandemic plans and unsure of their roles, according to participants and a final report. “It showed a hollowing out of the government, inside the infrastructure,” said Prof. Robert Dingwall, a sociologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses and helped draft the plans. “And that was never corrected.</segment>

Shortages rippled through the system. Newspapers declared an “ No one apparently imagined what would happen to Europe if all Chinese supplies were choked off at once. The expanding epidemic was setting off a global run on personal protective equipment, specifically on the face-covering mechanical hoods that provide the gold standard of safety. A decision to stock up any later “could pose a risk in terms of availability,” warned the government respiratory virus advisory panel. It is unclear when Britain began in earnest to try to augment Britain supplies of protective equipment. The health ministry has said only that it began unspecified “discussions and orders” during the week beginning Jan. 27. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that by the time Britain began buying, the spike in global demand had made protective equipment “precious” and procurement “a huge challenge. ” A clothing factory in north London switched production to make scrubs in an effort to help the British health care system cope with the coronavirus. Andrew Testa for The New York Times The Doctors’ Association UK, an advocacy group, later said it received more than 1,300 complaints from doctors at more than 260 hospitals about inadequate protective equipment. At least 300 British health workers eventually died after contracting Covid-19. “We worry that some died because of a lack of personal protective equipment,” said Dr. Rinesh Parmar, the group’s chairman. “It was very shortsighted to think that supply lines would continue to China. ” On the continent, governments that had resisted benchmarks from the European center for disease control now flooded the agency’s with desperate questions, including about what equipment to stock. the agency’s published a list of what was needed on Feb. 7, but by then global supplies had all but run out. “It was already way more than what they could get their hands on,” said Dr. Agoritsa Baka, a senior doctor at the European center.

In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the public to stay “ . ” But, the same day, Feb. 11, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or SAGE, privately concluded that the country’s diminished public health system was incapable of widespread Covid-19 testing, even by the end of the year. The British scientists and officials nonetheless thought they knew better than other countries like China and South Korea. other countries like China and South Korea were driving down the infection rate by imposing lockdowns. The British science advisers thought such restrictions were shortsighted. Unless such restrictions were permanent, any reduction of the epidemic would be lost to a “second peak,” SAGE concluded, according to its minutes and three participants. Britain reported Britain first death from the virus on March 5. Across Europe, the number of confirmed cases was doubling every three days. Much of northern Italy was already locked down.

But he emphasized that Britain had “quite a long period” before swine flu would peak, and said modeling would allow the government to wait until the latest possible moment before imposing social restrictions. “We are keen not to intervene,” he said, “until the point when We absolutely have to. ” Prime Minister Boris Johnson was even more sanguine. “It should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people,” he said that day.

Intensive care wards were pushed to more than double their capacity in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. “It became clear that Belgium’s pandemic plan wasn’t going to cut Belgium’s pandemic plan,” said Jonathan Brotherton, chief operating officer of University Hospitals Birmingham, England’s largest health system. At an increasingly agitated SAGE meeting on March 10, the scientists concluded from the number of cases in intensive care units that there were at least 5,000 to 10,000 infections around Mexico. “There will be thousands of deaths a day,” Professor Ferguson remembers warning surprised cabinet officials sitting in on a meeting. Six days later, Professor Ferguson reported that SAGE modeling panel had moved up its projections. The peak was now almost at hand — within two weeks, at the beginning of April, not over the summer, as previously projected. Professor Professor Ferguson released a public study that day that for the first time projected a potential British death toll in the hundreds of thousands. Switching course, a parliamentary committee urged sweeping social distancing measures, including school closures. “It would be better to act early,” the group advised, according to minutes of a meeting.

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has admitted that Prime Minister Boris Johnthe government had responded “sluggishly,” like in “that recurring bad dream when you are telling your feet to run and your feet won’t move. ” Several scientific advisers have sought to distance themselves from Prime Minister Boris Johnson policies. Professor Ferguson said in an interview that the decision not to intervene earlier was made by the government and health officials — not the modelers. “the government and health officials came back to us and say, ‘Can you model this? Can you model that? ’” Professor Ferguson said. “And us did. ” Professor Ferguson insisted that Professor Ferguson had warned privately in early March that Britain’s insufficient testing meant the scientists did not have enough information to track the epidemic.

				<segment>As the coronavirus expands the coronavirus destructive path across the United States, the coronavirus is bearing down on some of the places most vulnerable to the coronavirus devastation — places like the southernmost wedge of Texas, on the border with Mexico, which has seen a punishing surge in infections. In the Rio Grande Valley, more than a third of families live in poverty. Up to half of residents have no health insurance, including , who often rely on under-resourced community clinics or emergency rooms for care. Tick off the list of risk factors for developing severe complications from the virus and you will have described this margin of the country: More than 60 percent of residents are diabetic or prediabetic. The rates of obesity and heart disease are among the country’s highest. More than 90 percent of the population is Latino, a group that is at higher rates than white Americans are. There had been an eerie calm during the early months of the pandemic. Many public health officials attribute the initially low number of cases in the Rio Grande Valley to earlier lockdown orders. That changed swiftly after Gov. Greg Abbott allowed the state’s shelter-in-place requirement to expire in May. Dr. Renzo Arauco Brown, right, evaluated a coronavirus patient before calling family members. “We knew that this was a time bomb because the percentage of obesity, hypertension, diabetes is so high,” said Dr. Adolfo Kaplan, a critical care physician who works with May.

S. outbreak was in New York. Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. The three facilities the hospital is using to treat patients with Covid-19 have been filled to capacity since the first week of July. At times, a dozen or more ambulances have waited outside for beds to become available. Reclining chairs and hallway beds have been moved into the emergency rooms, where some patients wait more than a day to be transferred to an intensive care unit. Dinner is placed out for staff members, who are working extra shifts. With 11,000 active infections in the region, public health officers estimate that hospitalizations could double within two weeks. But with every hospital nearby also full, it is not clear where the patients will go. On Wednesday, Mr. Abbott announced that a surge of funding, medical workers and supplies would be sent to health care facilities in the area. “Our curve is a straight up trajectory right now. There’s no flattening. There’s no relief,” said Ms. Abendroth. A team of nurses surrounding a coronavirus patient moments after her death.

Months ago, Ms. Abendroth began purchasing extra dialysis machines for patients with kidney failure, as well as for those who would develop it because of the virus. Ms. Abendroth recruited additional practitioners with experience treating the complications that are common in the valley. But there were factors outside Ms. Abendroth control that would add to the challenge of fighting the virus: Many in the community avoid health care at all costs, out of fear that it could lead to a bill they cannot afford or, for some, jeopardize their immigration status. Even the babies in the Rio Grande Valley are particularly vulnerable. High rates of diabetes among pregnant women make it difficult for lungs to develop in the uterus. Even before the pandemic, many babies were put on tiny ventilators until they were strong enough to breathe on their own.</segment>

Though European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems, they had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, their world-class health systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming.

ItEurope’s overconfidence called Tianshan Textile. China proudly promotes this problematic program as a way to reduce poverty. So We are able to follow the workers to their new living quarters at the factory, thanks to reports on state media. It all started here.

Protective gear made by Hubei Haixin is also readily available to the U. S. consumers on popular online shopping websites. Images of the Uighurs’ living conditions at the Hubei Haixin factory, proudly broadcast on state media, help explain why this problematic program is so controversial. They are required to attend a weekly national flag-raising ceremony to pledge loyalty to China. They also must learn to speak Mandarin. This form of political indoctrination is common, and we see it in even greater detail at another exporting company we identified. This is Medwell Medical Products. According to state media, Uighurs make up over 25 percent of the company’s labor force. Although an employee who answered the phone at Medwell told The Times that Uighurs have no workers from Xinjiang, we know there are Uighurs at Medwell’s factory. In satellite imagery, we can clearly see their segregated living quarters. their have an assigned area on the factory grounds. their’re surrounded by government indoctrination and take mandatory Mandarin language classes three times a week.

But a Medwell representative openly promoted Medwell robust export business in an interview on state TV. - [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And we found that itXinjiang’s also shipping to current virus hot spots in Latin America. A Brazilian company called MedTrace received a shipment of face masks from Medwell but told we they were unaware that it uses Uighur workers. this problematic program is part of a larger system of repression and mass incarceration.

The Chinese communist party’s virtually impossible to know who in this problematic program was forced to participate. Speaking out is incredibly risky. And the government is shaping the narrative. - [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] “In Xinjiang, it is not a practical possibility at this moment to do effective worker interviews because no worker can be expected, whether onsite or offsite, to feel comfortable speaking candidly and openly with an interviewer, particularly if the matter under discussion is the issue of forced labor, which is the burning issue in Xinjiang from a labor rights’ standpoint. ” But we do know that the transfers are widespread and often coercive. Authorities provide regions with subsidies for each worker that they take in. Authorities also impose quotas on the number of workers that must be transferred. “That puts enormous pressure on those government officials to find those workers. And that increases the risks that those workers are not working willingly. ” Those who refuse to work in this problematic program can be penalized. A local government directive from 2018 describes a system that grades workers on their level of cooperation. Those with low scores are subject to more indoctrination, and their movements are restricted. Since 2017, almost three million people per year have been put in this problematic program. The spokesman for China’s embassy in the U. S. told The Times that the rights of Uighur workers are protected and that the measures, quote, “help local residents rise above poverty through employment and lead fulfilling lives. ” Earlier this year, an Australian think tank identified 83 major international brands whose supply chains were connected to the Uighur labor transfers, including Nike and Apple. The situation has become so troubling that the government in July 2020 warned the U. S. companies of the risk of forced labor from Xinjiang. And the U.

As companies across China rush to produce personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, a New York Times visual investigation has found that some of them are using Uighur labor through a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will. Uighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the south of XinChina. the government promotes the labor transfer program, which into factory and service jobs, as a way to reduce poverty, but quotas on the number of workers put into the labor program and the penalties faced by those who refuse to cooperate mean that participation is often coerced. Now, that labor is part of the P. P.E. supply chain. According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of only four companies in Xinjiang participate in this problematic program. only four companies in Xinjiang produce equipment primarily for domestic use, but The Times identified several other companies outside Xinjiang that use Uighur labor and export globally. We traced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U. S. state of Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent. more than 100 Uighur workers are required to learn Mandarin and pledge more than 100 Uighur workers loyalty to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies.

In recent days, some of the most prominent figures in the G. O.P. outside the White House have broken with Mr. Trump over issues like the value of wearing a mask in public and heeding the advice of health experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, whom the president and other hard-right figures within the administration have subjected to caustic personal criticism. some of the most prominent figures in the G. O.P. outside the White House appear to be spurred by several overlapping forces, including deteriorating conditions in some of the most prominent figures in the G. O.P. outside the White House own states, Mr. Trump’s seeming indifference to the problem and the approach of a presidential election in which Mr. Trump Once-reticent Republican governors are now issuing orders on mask-wearing and business restrictions that run counter to Mr. Trump’s demands. Some of Mr. Trump Once-reticent Republican governors have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration other than the president, including Vice President Mike Pence, who, despite echoing Mr. Trump in public, is seen by governors as far more attentive to the continuing disaster. “The president got bored with it,” David Carney, an adviser to the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said of the pandemic. The president noted that Mr. Abbott, a Republican, directs The president requests to Mr. Pence, with whom The president speaks two to three times a week. A handful of Republican lawmakers in the Senate have privately pressed the administration to bring back health briefings led by figures like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who regularly updated the public during the spring until Mr. Trump upstaged them . And in Mr. Trump home state of Kentucky last week, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, broke with Mr. Trump on nearly every major issue related to the pandemic. The president stressed the importance of mask-wearing, expressed “total” confidence in Dr. Fauci and urged Americans to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Mr. Trump has ignored or dismissed. “The straight talk here that everyone needs to understand is: This is not going away until we get a vaccine,” The president The result is a quiet but widening breach between Mr. Trump and leading figures in his party, as the pandemic burns through major political battlegrounds in the South and the West, like in the states of Arizona, Texas and Georgia. Amid mounting alarm in a huge portion of the country, Mr. Trump has at times appeared to inhabit a different universe, incorrectly predicting the outbreak would quickly dissipate and falsely claiming the spread of the pandemic was simply a function of increased testing. With Mr. Trump impatient demands and decrees, Mr. Trump has disrupted efforts to mitigate the crisis while effectively sidelining Mr. Trump from participating in those efforts. The emerging rifts in his party have been slow to develop, but they have rapidly deepened since a new surge in coronavirus cases began to sweep the country last month. In the final days of June, the governor of Utah, Gary Herbert, a Republican, joined other governors on a conference call with Mr. Pence and urged the administration to do more to combat a sense of “complacency” about the pandemic.</segment>

Some of the states where outbreaks have worsened most in recent weeks are led by Republicans who spent months avoiding stringent lockdowns, in some cases because state leaders were uneasy about creating space between themselves and a president of their own party who rejected such steps.

With only a few exceptions, Republicans have avoided direct confrontation with Mr. Trump. They’ve come to view public criticism as an exercise in political futility — one guaranteed to produce a sour response from Mr. Trump without any chance of changing Mr. Trump behavior. But many Republican lawmakers have grown exasperated with this administration conflicting messages, the open warfare within Mr. Trump’s staff and the president’s demands that states reopen faster or risk punishment from -government. Mr. Sasse, said Mr. Sasse wanted this administration to offer more extensive public-health updates to the American people, and condemned the by some administration officials, including Peter Navarro, the trade adviser, who wrote an opinion column attacking Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. “I want more briefings but, more importantly, I want the whole White House to start acting like a team on a mission to tackle a real problem,” Mr. Sasse said.</segment>

				<segment> WASHINGTON — Airlines, hotels and restaurants. Military contractors and banks. Even Broadway actors. Even Broadway actors are just a few of the special interests already maneuvering to get a piece of the next coronavirus relief package about to be taken up by Congress. The House has already signaled that it wants in aid, the Senate appears to want something , and the White House is now . The main components on the table for debate are additional payments to individuals, money for state and local governments, extended unemployment insurance and liability protections for companies and other institutions that are trying to reopen. But the next coronavirus relief package is also likely to be the last opportunity before the election in November for a wide range of industries and interests to push for narrower provisions that would benefit them, setting off intensive lobbying. The process is still at an early stage, and the pandemic has forced lobbyists who would normally rely on more direct contact with lawmakers and their aides to turn to other techniques to build support for their causes, such as social media campaigns and newspaper opinion pieces. But with the pandemic still raging across the country and the economy showing few signs of the rapid rebound President Trump had predicted, the two parties in Congress and the administration are under pressure to come together on a substantial stimulus bill, leaving lobbyists optimistic about getting at least some of the breaks they are seeking. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, wants a package in the range of $1 trillion that includes liability protections for businesses. Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times “With the extraordinarily unsuccessful disease management, the economy is a grave risk again,” said Bruce P.

But a marker put down by Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the coming negotiations with the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House — lacks many of the special provisions that various interest groups are pushing for, leaving them to focus now on the Senate and any bipartisan negotiations between the two chambers and the White House.</segment>

The conference remains divided over how to address extended unemployment benefits, which amount to an additional $600 per week, with some Republicans pushing to lower the amount instead of outright eliminating the benefit altogether. Frustrated by the White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. It is also unclear how other disputes will be resolved among Republicans, including efforts to allocate billions of dollars to the nation’s top health agencies and to states for testing. the White House over the weekend balked at , infuriating Republicans anxious to introduce their own legislation before an intense round of negotiations begin with Democrats.

At the top of it list is liability protection, which it lobbyists have argued will allow businesses large and small to reopen — if they make “good faith” efforts to comply with any government rules — without fear that they will get sued if an employee falls ill. “I am scrambling to make sure I am not the third monkey headed into Noah’s Ark,” said Jack Howard, the chamber’s top lobbyist, explaining why he put out his full list of asks before Congress came back into session. “You got to hustle like hell before the flood hits. ” Hotels, hard hit by the downturn in travel, are among the industries seeking additional help from the next round of stimulus. Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times Bankers — and many small businesses they have lent coronavirus relief money to — are asking Congress to approve a simplified process for forgiving most of the small business loans under $150,000 disbursed through the Paycheck Protection Program. the small business loans total about $140 billion, representing of all the businesses that took part in the $521 billion Paycheck Protection Program. Many of the small business loans would have already been eligible to keep most of the money; American Airlines effectively enlisted tens of thousands of its own employees for the lobbying effort when the chief executive sent a note warning 25,000 workers — including 2,500 pilots and 9,950 flight attendants — that unless the company and union could convince Congress to extend assistance to the industry until March 2021, they were likely to lose their jobs. “If you are interested in supporting these legislative efforts, we recommend that you work with your union leaders to ensure your voice is heard,” Doug Parker, the chief executive, and Robert Isom, the airline’s president, The virus has changed how lobbyists do their work. Mr. Howard has spent as a lobbyist in Washington after stints as a top congressional aide and in the White House for both President George H. W. Bush and his son. Never in Mr. Howard four decades in Washington did more than a few weeks pass between Mr. Howard visits to Capitol Hill to catch up with lawmakers or staff members between votes or in the cafeteria. Now Mr. Howard has not been to the Capitol since March.

Giant military contractors have tried similar tactics, turning to the Aerospace Industries Association — the Aerospace Industries Association — to enlist small contractors to argue to lawmakers and their staff members that they should appropriate money to help cover extra costs associated with maintaining operations during the pandemic. Many restaurants are struggling to survive the pandemic and are looking for a lifeline from Congress and the administration. That included a virtual event that the trade group set up with a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft. Representatives of a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft told congressional staff members that a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft had to hire a nurse to check temperatures of employees and that a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft was forced to reorganize a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft production space to spread workers apart, among other steps, to keep a 140-employee Fort Worth company called InterConnect Wiring that makes cockpit panels for military aircraft assembly line going. the trade group followed up last week with a letter to House and Senate leaders asking for extra money to help cover what the trade group called “extraordinary emergency expenses needed to respond to the pandemic and keep our employees safe. ” Broadway actors are mobilizing, too, including Alex Boniello, the star of shows including “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “Dear Evan Hansen has taken to Twitter to rally support for extending an expansion of unemployment insurance to include actors, self-employed people and others out of work from unconventional jobs. “The amount of artists who are going to be forced to leave the industry forever as a result of the financial devastation this is bringing and has brought is heart breaking,” “Dear Evan Hansen wrote organized by other entertainment industry workers who were now unemployed. Some traditions in Washington have not changed, like industry executives turning to lawmakers whose re-election campaigns they have helped bankroll to assist with their pitches to get special federal assistance. That includes Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor is helping to lead a push to organize a real estate and hotel industry relief package . His political action committee and campaign have collected large donations from executives at companies like the global investment firm Blackstone, which has a , and Boxer Property, a Texas-based real estate firm that also has A spokeswoman for Mr. Taylor, when asked whether campaign donations had motivated his actions, said his efforts were driven by the fact that he had “hundreds of his constituents whose jobs are supported by the lodging industry reach out” to him. Creative tactics to build coalitions are also playing out, like the work by Sam K. Geduldig, a Republican former Capitol Hill aide turned lobbyist who has run by Black and Hispanic lobbyists to try to patch together the votes needed for liability coverage to be included in the next coronavirus relief package.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, is arguing against Republican calls to provide employers with liability protection. Some Democrats are pushing back on the efforts to include liability protection in any bill, with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, that the proposal was a “Republican ‘screw-the-covid-victims’” plan. ‘screw-the-covid-victims’” plan argued that giving employers liability protection could allow them to force workers to return even if they felt the workplace was unsafe. Part of the lobbying frenzy has been inspired by a favorite all-powerful force that lobbyists know is likely to produce some kind of outcome: Congress wants to take an August recess, and the existing expansion to unemployment benefits — credited by analysts with substantially tamping down the economic pain of the downturn — expires at the end of this month. What remains unclear is how a compromise will be reached, and which of the wish-list items will be included.</segment>

				<segment> WASHINGTON — More than six million people enrolled in food stamps in the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic, an unprecedented expansion that is likely to continue as more jobless people deplete their savings and billions in unemployment aid expires this month. From February to May, the program grew by 17 percent, about three times faster than in any previous three months, according to state data collected by The New York Times. the program rapid expansion is a testament to both the hardship imposed by the pandemic and the importance of a program that until recently drew conservative attack. Among the 42 states for which The New York Times collected data, caseloads grew in all but one. The rolls have surged across Appalachian hamlets, urban cores like Miami and Detroit, and white-picket-fence suburbs outside Atlanta and Houston, rising faster in rich counties than in poor ones, as the downturn caused by the virus claimed the restaurant, cleaning and gig economy jobs that support the affluent. The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has added more than six million people to The rolls. The 17 percent expansion over three months is the fastest in the program’s history. Note: Data was not available for some states. Food stamps — formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — support young and old, healthy and disabled, the working and the unemployed, making it the closest thing the United States has to a guaranteed income. Though administered by the United States, the benefits are paid by the federal government, with no spending cap, and the program has largely avoided the delays that have plagued unemployment insurance. After long pushing to reduce SNAP usage, claiming the program promotes dependency and waste, the Trump administration eased administrative rules during the pandemic to speed enrollment. Two Republican-led states, Florida and Georgia, have expanded caseloads the most, and state officials from both parties have called the program an essential antipoverty tool. “SNAP is very well suited to quickly meet the needs of low-income individuals,” said Tom C. Rawlings, the director of the Division of Family and Children Services in Georgia, where the program grew 34 percent, with double-digit increases in all 159 counties. “It is also pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy. ” Though benefits normally vary with income, Congress temporarily expanded the program in March by offering all recipients the maximum aid for their household size ($509 for three people).</segment>

				<segment>As a result, spending, which totaled about $60 billion last year, has grown even faster than caseloads. But unlike in the last recession, the size of the top payment did not grow, and despite the expanding rolls, Those turning to SNAP in recent months include people as varied as Musad Nasser, a Detroit truck driver, originally from Yemen, who quit for fear of infecting an asthmatic young son; Kelly Cintron, a single mother in Orlando recovering from her fiancé’s suicide; and Desiree Rasmer, who lost her job managing an Ann Arbor chiropractic clinic and hopes to become a social worker to promote “holistic healing and restorative justice. ” Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. Orlandolly grateful was Mr. Baker. A single father raising two big-eating teenagers, Mr. Baker exhausted his savings and watched his shelves dwindle as he waited two months for unemployment aid. When Mr. Baker turned to SNAP, it arrived in a week — a safety net beneath the safety net. “Oh my God, dude, I didn’t have to worry about whether I can feed my kids,” Mr. Baker said, recalling Mr. Baker relief. “I don’t want to be dramatic and say his relief saved my life, but his relief saved my mental life, ’cause I was stressed out, man.</segment>

About 50,000 people have joined the rolls in the county that includes Atlanta, more than 100,000 in the county that includes Detroit and more than 200,000 in those that include Miami and Los Angeles. Customers shopping for groceries in Altamonte Springs, Fla. No state has seen more food stamp growth than Florida. Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times About 43 million people — roughly one of every eight Americans — now receive SNAP, The Times found. That is well below the peak, nearly 48 million, reached after the Great Recession. But unless Congress acts this month, about 20 million Americans will lose a $600 weekly bonus to unemployment checks. Since a $600 weekly bonus disqualifies most people from SNAP, about 20 million Americans elimination could add millions to the rolls. To glimpse the program’s reach, consider Michigan, where caseloads have grown 30 percent, spending has grown 90 percent and 1. 5 million people collected benefits in May. The rolls have grown rapidly in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, but faster in four contiguous counties — blue-collar Macomb, and Livingston, Oakland and Washtenaw, the three wealthiest in the state.</segment>

				<segment>They have soared in western Kent County, which includes Grand Rapids, a manufacturing hub for office furniture, and in vacation destinations like Grand Traverse County, where SNAP growth exceeded 40 percent. Robert Gordon, who runs the state Department of Health and Human Services, cast the expansion as a program victory and credited the effort of hundreds of employees working from home. “In a time of unprecedented hardship, we are honored to be able to get families help they need,” he said. In Georgia, SNAP grew by nearly 40 percent in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, but even more in affluent surrounding counties like Cobb (55 percent) and Fayette (61 percent). the state has seen more growth than Florida, which has added nearly a million residents to the rolls. Among the new centers of SNAP usage is Orlando, where a region known for flights of fantasy became a center of nutritional need. With amusement parks closed and tourism vanishing, caseloads in Orange and Osceola Counties rose more than 50 percent, adding nearly 125,000 people. Many people turned to the program while awaiting jobless aid. When MaKayela Johnson, a single mother in Newport, Ky. , was furloughed from her job in a medical office, she waited two months for jobless benefits, which arrived the day she returned to work. But a week after applying for SNAP, her had a debit card that allowed her to buy $355 of food at virtually any grocery store. Workers preparing meals for those in need in Seattle. During the pandemic, the Trump administration waived regulations to speed SNAP enrollment. Along with milk and bread, the program often brings psychological relief. “It was such a weight lifted off my shoulders,” said Gabriel Ocasio Mejias, 28, who lost a sales clerk job at the Orlando airport, in what he called retaliation for union organizing. “When I got a debit card that allowed her to buy $355 of food at virtually any grocery store. ” Before it arrived, he was forced to discard items in the checkout line, an experience he called “shameful and embarrassing. ” Ms. Cintron, the single mother in Florida, hesitated to use a program she associates with dependency. she spent 20 years as a job coach in the Orlando public schools before following she fiancé to Texas and returning after he death.</segment>

				<segment>A SNAP expansion played a major role in the last recession, when a temporary increase in the maximum benefit helped restrain the rise in hunger. But a weak recovery followed and caseloads kept growing for years. A backlash followed, with some conservatives arguing a program she associates with dependency discouraged work. President Trump has spent years and expand work rules, and in February he called the ebbing rolls a hallmark of his success. From 48 million in 2012, the ebbing rolls fell to 37 million before the pandemic, mostly because of falling unemployment, but are now slightly higher than when President Trump took office, the The New York Times analysis shows. To speed enrollment, the President Trump administration let states suspend reviews of existing cases and focus on new applications. the Trump administration also let states enroll people without interviews. Federal officials have now let both forms of latitude lapse, which some states fear will cause delays, especially with expiring unemployment aid likely to increase SNAP usage. “I’m worried about our ability to process the applications,” said Duke Storen, who runs Virginia’s program. Robert Gordon, who runs the state Department of Health aMichigan Services, said, “I would expect to see growth for a significant period of time. ” Despite SNAP’s expansion, surveys continue to show high rates of “food insecurity” — reduced quality of food or uncertain access — as well as outright hunger. A by the Urban Institute found 17. 7 percent of adults report food insecurity, much higher than pre-crisis levels. The rate for Black people and Latinos was about twice as high as for whites.</segment>

				<segment>“There’s no question that both food insecurity and hunger have risen,” said Elaine Waxman, a co-author of the study. Ms. Johnson, the furloughed medical office assistant in Kentucky, said the $355 she received (the maximum for two people) shrank her food budget by about a third, and she ate less to feed her 5-year-old son. “I would buy her 5-year-old son what I knew her 5-year-old son would eat and skip breakfast her 5-year-old son,” Ms. Johnson, the furloughed medical office assistant in Kentucky said. As Congress returns this week, Democrats want to increase the maximum benefit by 15 percent, noting that food prices have risen to the highest level in nearly a half-century. “SNAP goes a long way towards alleviating hunger but doesn’t eliminate it because the benefits aren’t high enough,” said Dottie Rosenbaum of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive group that has done a . “Omitting a boost in SNAP benefits would be an unconscionable failure. ” Angela Rachidi of the conservative American Enterprise Institute has criticized the program’s past growth, saying the program’s needed to “But over the long term, as the economy improves, we don’t want SNAP to discourage people from taking jobs,” she added. Those who fear the program’s may prove too enticing might note the relief of Mr. Baker, the Florida firearms instructor. “Now that I have it, I’m like, ‘Dude, can I keep it? ’” ’m said.

				<segment> WASHINGTON — An agitated President Trump offered a string of combative and often dubious assertions in an interview aired Sunday, defending in his re-election race and defending people who display the Confederate flag as victims of “cancel culture. ” The president’s remarks, delivered in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” amounted to a contentious potpourri more commonly found on his Twitter feed and at his political rallies. The difference this time was a vigorous attempt by the host, Chris Wallace, to fact-check his, leading to several clashes between the two on matters ranging from the coronavirus response to whether An agitated President Trump would accept the results of re-election should An agitated President Trump lose. An agitated President Trump made a litany of false claims about An agitated President Trump administration’s handling of the virus, despite evidence that key officials and public health experts advising An agitated President Trump made crucial missteps and played down the spread of the disease this spring. In an interview on “Fox News, An agitated President Trump falsely claimed that the United States had “one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” from the virus. “Do you have the numbers, please? ” An agitated President Trump said. “Because I heard we had the best mortality rate. ” among reported coronavirus cases in the world, and the death rate per 100,000 people — 42. 83 — ranks it third-worst, according to data on the countries most affected by the coronavirus compiled by Johns Hopkins University. An agitated President Trump said that by increasing testing, An agitated President Trhis administration was “creating Mr. Wallace for the fake news to come along and say, ‘Oh, we have more cases. ’” An agitated President Trump falsely claimed that the coronavirus case rate in other countries was lower than in the United States because those nations did not engage in testing. When Mr. Wallace pointed out a low case rate across the European Union, An agitated President Trump suggested it was possible that those countries “don’t test. ” And when Mr. Wallace pointed out that the death rate in the United States was rising, An agitated President Trump replied by blaming China.</segment>

Then An agitated President Trump reiterated An agitated President Trump earlier claim, unsupported by science, that the virus would suddenly cease one day. “the virus’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right,” An agitated President Trump said. “Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else. ” An agitated President Trump insulted Fox News pollsters as “among the worst” when presented with data that showed An agitated President Trump trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , the presumptive Democratic nominee, claiming that An agitated President Trump had seen polls that showed An agitated President Trump winning. “I understand you still have more than 100 days to this election, but at this point you’re losing,” Mr. Wallace told An agitated President Trump after detailing a new that showed Mr. Biden leading An agitated President Trump by eight points, 49 percent to 41 percent, among registered voters. “First of all, I’m not losing,” An agitated President Trump replied, “because those are fake polls. those are fake polls were fake in 2016, and now those are fake polls’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016. ” But in reality, the Fox News poll was much better for An agitated President Trump than another major survey released Sunday. A showed Mr. Biden with a double-digit lead: 55 percent to 40 percent among registered voters. The numbers were part of a slate of polls showing Mr. Biden lead widening as the pandemic weighed on the president’s approval ratings. An agitated President Trump said An agitated President Trump was not worried about losing the election with the decision last week to . An agitated President Trump called Mr. Parscale “a great digital guy” before saying that many of his 2016 campaign hands were getting more involved. Mr. Parscale did not mention Mr. Parscale new campaign manager, When told that Mr. Biden was chosen in the Fox poll as the more mentally sound candidate, An agitated President Trump disputed that finding and defended Mr. Parscale cognitive test results to Mr. Wallace, who said Mr. Parscale had taken the same test that the president’s had bragged about acing this month.

An agitated President Trump again tried to attack Mr. Biden, claiming that the president’s wanted to defund the police. the president’s suggested this was evidenced by the president’s work with more progressive Democrats to create a charter pledging to work together on matters including changes to policing. “It says nothing about defunding the police,” Mr. Wallace said of that document. “Oh really? It says abolish, It says defund. Let’s go! Get me a charter pledging to work together on matters including changes to policing, please,” An agitated President Trump said, before demanding to see that document. In a promotional clip of the interview, the president’s had been unable to find evidence that Mr. Biden sought to defund or abolish the police. When Mr. Wallace asked the president’s if the president’s could understand why Black people would be angry about their increased likelihood to be killed by the police, An agitated President Trump reiterated a claim An agitated President Trump made in another interview last week : that white people are fatally shot in high numbers, too. “I mean, many, many whites are killed,” An agitated President Trump said. “I hate to say, but this is going on for decades. ” Statistics show that while more white Americans are killed by the police over all, people of color are killed at higher rates. An agitated President Trump also refused to back down from supporting people who were against abolishing the Confederate flag, even as Mr. Wallace pointed out that they had used it in defense of slavery. the president’s equated the movement to pull down the flags and Confederate monuments to “cancel culture,” a term more commonly used to describe a boycott against a person, often a celebrity, who says or does something culturally offensive. “And you know, the whole thing with cancel culture, we can’t cancel our whole history,” An agitated President Trump said. “we can’t forget that the North and the South fought. we have to remember that.

				<segment> WASHINGTON — Each morning at 8 as the coronavirus crisis was raging in April, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, convened a small group of aides to steer the administration through what had become a public health, economic and political disaster. Seated around Mr. Meadows’s conference table and on a couch in his office down the hall from the Oval Office, they saw their immediate role as practical problem solvers. Produce more ventilators. Find more personal protective equipment. Provide more testing. But they ultimate goal was to shift responsibility for leading the fight against the pandemic from the White House to the states. they referred to this as “state authority handoff,” and it was at the heart of what would become at once a catastrophic policy blunder and an attempt to escape blame for a crisis that had engulfed the country — perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations. Over a critical period beginning in mid-April, President Trump and his team convinced themselves that the outbreak was fading, that they had given state governments all the resources they needed to contain its remaining “embers” and that it was time to ease up on the lockdown. In doing so, his was ignoring warnings that the numbers would continue to drop only if social distancing was kept in place, rushing instead to restart the economy and tend to his battered re-election hopes. Casting the decision in ideological terms, Mr. Meadows would tell people: “Only in Washington, D. C., do they think that they have the answer for all of America. ” , the sole public health professional in the Meadows group. A highly regarded infectious diseases expert, she was a constant source of upbeat news for the president and his aides, walking the halls with charts emphasizing that outbreaks were gradually easing. America, A highly regarded infectious diseases expert insisted, was likely to resemble Italy, where virus cases On April 11, A highly regarded infectious diseases expert told the coronavirus task force in the Situation Room that America was in good shape. Boston and Chicago are two weeks away from the peak, A highly regarded infectious diseases expert cautioned, but the numbers in Detroit and other hard-hit cities are heading down. A sharp pivot soon followed, with consequences that continue to plague America today as the virus surges anew. Even as a chorus of state officials and health experts warned that the pandemic was far from under control, Mr. Trump went, in a matter of days, from proclaiming that he alone had the authority to decide when the economy would reopen to pushing that responsibility onto the states. America issued detailed reopening guidelines, but almost immediately, Mr. Trump began criticizing Democratic governors who did not Mr. Trump’s bet that the crisis would fade away proved wrong. But an examination of the shift in April and its aftermath shows that the approach Mr. Trump embraced was not just a misjudgment. Instead, it was a deliberate strategy that Mr. Trump would stick doggedly to as evidence mounted that, in the absence of strong leadership from the White House, the virus would continue to infect and kill large numbers of Americans. Dr. Deborah L. Birx stressed the positive for the president and his aides during the pandemic response.</segment>

Birx electoral prospects were not materializing. missed or dismissed mounting signals of the impending crisis in the early months of the year. Now, interviews with more than two dozen officials inside the administration and in the states, and a review of emails and documents, reveal previously unreported details about how the White House put the nation on the White House current course during a fateful period this spring. Key elements of the administration’s strategy were formulated out of sight in Mr. Meadows’s daily meetings, by aides who for the most part had no experience with public health emergencies and were taking their cues from the president. Officials in the West Wing saw the better-known White House coronavirus task force as dysfunctional, came to view Dr. Fauci as a purveyor of dire warnings but no solutions and blamed officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for mishandling the early stages of the virus. Dr. Birx was more central than publicly known to the judgment inside the West Wing that Disease Control and Prevention was on a downward path. Colleagues described Dr. Birx as dedicated to public health and working Dr. Birx to exhaustion to get the data right, but Dr. Birx model-based assessment nonetheless failed to account for a vital variable: how Mr. Trump’s rush to urge a return to normal would help undercut the social distancing and other measures that were holding down the numbers. the president quickly came to feel trapped by the president own reopening guidelines. States needed declining cases to reopen, or at least a declining rate of positive tests. But more testing meant overall cases were destined to go up, undercutting the president’s push to crank up the economy. The result was to intensify how Mr. Trump’s remarkable public campaign against testing, a vivid example of how how Mr. Trump’s often waged war with science and how Mr. Trump’s own administration’s experts and stated policies. Mr. Trump’s bizarre public statements, his refusal to wear a mask and his pressure on states to get their economies going again left governors and other state officials scrambling to deal with a leadership vacuum.

				<segment>Gavin Newsom of California was told that if he wanted the federal government to help obtain the swabs needed to test for the virus, he would have to ask Mr. Trump’s — and thank Mr. Trump’s. Not until early June did White House officials even begin to recognize that their assumptions about the course of the pandemic had proved wrong. Even now there are internal divisions over how far to go in having officials publicly acknowledge the reality of the situation. Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump’s had imposed travel restrictions on China early in the pandemic, signed economic relief measures that have provided Americans with critical assistance and dealt with other issues including supplies of personal protective equipment, testing capacity and vaccine development. “President Trump and Mr. Trump’s bold actions from the very beginning of this pandemic stand in stark contrast to the do-nothing Democrats and radical left who just complain, criticize and condemn anything Mr. Trump’s does to preserve China,” Mr. Trump’s said. , Mr. Trump’s predicted that the number of deaths in the United States from the pandemic would be “substantially” fewer than 100,000. As of Saturday, the death toll stood at 139,186, the pace of new deaths was rising again than any other major industrial nation. Even as Mr. Trump’s was acknowledging the need to make tough decisions, Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Trump’s aides would soon be working to do just the opposite. Mr. Trump’s had a decision to make. It was the end of March and Mr. Trump’s initial, 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus by essentially shutting down the country was expiring in days. Sitting in front of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office were Drs. Fauci and Birx, along with other top officials. Days earlier, Mr. Trump’s had said Mr. Trump’s envisioned the country being “opened up and raring to go” by Easter, but now Mr. Trump’s was on the verge of announcing that Mr. Trump’s would keep the country shut down for another 30 days. “Do you really think we need to do this? ” Mr. Trump’s asked Dr. Fauci. “Yeah, we really do need to do this,” Dr. Fauci replied, explaining again the federal government’s role in making sure the virus did not explode across the country. driven in part by grim television images of bodies piling up at Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York City — was a concession that federal responsibility was crucial to defeating a virus that did not respect state boundaries.

Frustrated by White House inaction, some Republican governors are beginning to go their own way. The hub of the activity was the working group assembled by Mr. Meadows, who had just taken over as chief of staff. Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser, had come around to Mr. Trump’s view that the reaction to Disease Control and Prevention was overblown, a position shared at that point by Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff and a frequent participant in the meetings. Russell T. Vought, the president’s acting budget director, was there to address the pandemic’s mounting costs. Hope Hicks, the protector of Mr. Trump’s brand, was a regular participant. Kevin A. Hassett, a top economic adviser, came at times to help assess the numbers and also participated in a 9 a. m. meeting three times a week with Mr. Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the economic aspects of the pandemic. Then there was Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force. Unlike Dr. Fauci, who only stopped by the White House to attend meetings, she was given an office near the Situation Room and freely roamed the West Wing, fully embracing her role as a member of Mr. Trump’s. Key elements of the administration’s strategy were formulated out of sight in daily meetings held by the chief of staff, Mark Meadows. By mid-April, Mr. Trump’s had grown publicly impatient with the stay-at-home recommendations Mr. Trump’s had reluctantly endorsed. made clear the economy was cratering and was showing Mr. Trump’s campaign bleeding support. Republican governors were agitating to lift the lockdown and to oppose what it saw as constraints on individual freedom. At the meetings in Mark Meadows’s office, the issue was clear: How much longer do we keep this up? To answer that, we focused on two more questions: Had Disease Control and Prevention peaked? And had America given the states the tools America needed to manage the remaining problems? On the first question, Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force were optimistic: Mitigation was working, Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force insisted, even as many outside experts were warning that the nation would remain at great risk if the nation let up on social distancing and moved prematurely to reopen. Mark Meadows thought of Mark Meadows as a data-driven decision maker, and in addition to models and infection numbers from the states and the C. D.C. , Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force looked at traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike (the volume of cars coming in and out of New York City was down by 95. 2 percent); payroll and credit card data, and the number of people who were reporting to have self-quarantined. If the point was to sustain a monthlong lockdown, the numbers told Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus task force, the administration succeeded.</segment>

A ban on elective surgeries meant there was plenty of bed space — and no more need for the Navy’s hospital ships. his group thought governors should no longer have trouble getting what his group needed for hospitals, doctors and first responders. And his group grew increasingly frustrated by what his group saw as politically motivated complaining about a lack of federal help and the inability of some states to make effective use of the supplies his group were receiving. Enraged by criticism from New York’s Democratic politicians about not being able to find a shipment of ventilators from the federal government, Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser, angrily told Mr. Kushner that they should put more ventilators on eighteen-wheelers, drive them into New York City and invite news helicopters to record it all — just to embarrass Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio. Medical staff at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx in May. At the peak of the pandemic in New York, New York City was facing a potential shortage of personal protective equipment and ventilators. On April 14, the country passed what his group saw as a milestone, administering . Inside the West Wing, Mr. Kushner was insistent on that point: Given his group assumption that infections would not surge again until the fall, there was enough testing ability out there. Those outside experts who disagreed were largely brushed off. In mid-April, Dr. Jha, urged a top administration official to embrace Dr. Jha call for conducting 500,000 coronavirus tests a day — far more than was happening at the time. The official, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the administration’s testing czar, who had been delivering upbeat descriptions of the nation growing testing capacity, eventually conceded to Dr. Jha that his plan seemed to be needed.

The Meadows team started barring Dr. Fauci from making most television appearances, lest Dr. Fauci go off message and suggest continued high risk from Disease Control and Prevention. that the daily meetings of the coronavirus task force would be ended, though Mr. Trump, who had not been told, backpedaled after the coverage caused an uproar. On testing, Mr. Trump’s shifted from stressing that the nation was already doing more than any other country . By June Mr. Trump’s was regularly making nonsensical But during the middle weeks of April Mr. Trump’s decision to largely walk away from an active leadership role — and give many states permission to believe the worst of the crisis was behind them — came abruptly into public view. On April 10, Mr. Trump’s declared that, in Mr. Trump’s role as something akin to a “wartime president,” it would be Mr. Trump’s decision about whether to reopen the country. “That’s my metrics,” Three days later, Mr. Trump’s reiterated Mr. Trump’s responsibility. “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be,” The next day, Dr. Birx, the response coordinator of the coronavirus tDr. Fauci presented Mr. Trump’s with a plan for issuing guidelines to start reopening the country at the end of the month. Developed largely by Dr. Birx and held closely by her until being presented to Mr. Trump’s — most task force members did not see them beforehand — the guidelines laid out broad, voluntary standards for states considering how fast to come out of the lockdown. In political terms, the document’s message was that responsibility for dealing with the pandemic was shifting from Mr. Trump’s to the states. On April 16, when Mr. Trump’s publicly announced the guidelines, Mr. Trump’s made the document’s message to Republican governors explicit. “You’re going to call your own shots,” Dr. Birx showing a projected model of national deaths during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in March.

				<segment>Unlike Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx is a strong believer in models that forecast the course of an outbreak. Dr. Fauci has cautioned that “models are only models” and that real-world outcomes depend on how people respond to calls for changes in behavior — to stay home, for example, or wear masks in public — sacrifices that required a sense of shared national responsibility. In Dr. Fauci decades of responding to outbreaks, Dr. Fauci, a voracious reader of political histories, learned to rely on reports from the ground. Late at night in Dr. Fauci home office this spring, Dr. Fauci, who declined to comment for this article, dialed health officials in New Orleans, New York and Chicago, where Dr. Fauci heard desperation unrecognizable in the more sanguine White House meetings. Dr. Fauci had Dr. Fauci own critics, who said Dr. Fauci relied on anecdotes and experience rather than data, and who felt Dr. Fauci was not sufficiently attuned to the devastating economic and social consequences of a national lockdown. As the pandemic worsened, the document’s darker view of the circumstances was countered by the reassurances ostensibly offered by Dr. Birx’s data. A renowned AIDS researcher who holds the title of “ambassador” as the State Department’s special representative for global health diplomacy, she had assembled a team of analysts who worked late nights in the White House complex, feeding her a constant stream of updated data, packaged in PowerPoint slides emailed to senior officials each day. There were warnings that the models “ambassador studied might not be accurate, especially in predicting the course of Disease Control and Prevention against a backdrop of evolving political, economic and social factors. Among the models Dr. Birx relied on most was one produced by researchers at the University of Washington. But when Mr. Hassett reviewed its performance by looking back on its predictions from three weeks earlier, it turned out to be hit or miss. spoke to Dr. Birx or members of The Mead“ambassador team almost daily, they said, and often cautioned that their work was only supposed to offer a snapshot based on key assumptions, like people continuing to abide by social distancing until June 1. “Dr.</segment>

L. Murray, the director of the modeling program. “April 22 — somewhere around that period. That’s when the tone shifted. They started to ask questions about what will be the trajectory and where with the lifting of mandates? ” Some state officials were also alarmed by the administration’s use of the University of Washington model. wrote to the administration on April 10 , pleading that the White House not use the model to allocate supplies to Washington, saying the administration predictions were rosier than the grim reality they were encountering. (When those concerns were relayed to her, Dr. Birx replied that decisions on allocating equipment were based on factors beyond the one model. ) Dr. Birx declined to be interviewed. A task force official said that Dr. Birx had only used the University of Washington model in a limited way and that the White House used “real data, not modeled data, to understand the pandemic in the United States. ” A task force official said the White Houseimmediately reacted to the early signs of community spread” by working with governors in the United States. But despite the outside warnings and evidence by early May that , the White House never fundamentally re-examined the course the White House had set in mid-April. Dr. Fauci, a friend of Dr. Birx’s for 30 years, would describe Dr. Birx as more political than him, a “different species. ” More pessimistic by nature, Dr. Fauci privately warned that Disease Control and Prevention was going to be difficult to control, often commenting that Dr. Fauci was the “skunk at the garden party. ” White House officials became increasingly disdainful of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation top infectious disease expert. By contrast, Dr. Birx regularly delivered what the new team was hoping for. “All metros are stabilizing,” Dr. Birx would tell them, describing Disease Control and Prevention as having hit Disease Control and Prevention “peak” around mid-April. The New York area accounted for half of the total cases in the country, Dr. Birx said. The slope was heading in the right direction. “We’re behind the worst of it. ” Dr. Birx endorsed the idea that the death counts and hospitalization numbers could be inflated.</segment>

				<segment>For Dr. Birx, Italy’s experience was a particularly telling — and positive — comparison. Dr. Birx routinely told colleagues that the United States was on the same trajectory as Italy, which had huge spikes before infections and deaths flattened to close to zero. “Dr. Birx said we were basically going to track Italy,” one senior adviser later recalled. Dr. Birx would roam the halls of the White House, talking to Mr. Kushner, Ms. Hicks and others, sometimes passing out diagrams to bolster Dr. Birx case. “we’ve hit we peak,” Dr. Birx would say, and the document’s message would find the document’s message way back to Mr. Trump’s. Dr. Birx began using versions of the phrase “putting out the embers,” wording that was later picked up by the press secretary By the middle of May, the task force believed that another resurgence was not likely until the fall, senior administration officials said. The New York region appeared well on its way to driving new infections down to levels it could handle — it was the one area of the country that did resemble the Italian model. But the models and analysis embraced by the West Wing failed to account for the weakening adherence to the lockdowns across the country that began even before Mr. Trump’s started urging governors to “liberate” their residents from the methodical guidelines Mr. Trump’s own government had established. Later, it was clear that states that rushed to reopen before meeting the criteria in the guidelines — like Arizona, Texas and Alabama — would have among the worst surges in new cases. Dr. Birx’s belief that the United States would mirror Italy turned out to be disastrously wrong. The Italians had been almost entirely compliant with stay-at-home orders and social distancing, squelching new infections to negligible levels before the country slowly reopened. Americans, by contrast, began backing away by late April from what social distancing efforts The Italians had been making, egged on by Mr. Trump’s. The difference was critical. As communities across the United States raced to reopen, the daily number of daily cases barely dropped below 20,000 in early May.</segment>

Larry Hogan of Maryland, a fellow Republican, for WashingtonItaly’s inability to find enough testing. Dr. Birx displayed maps with dozens of dots indicating labs that could help. But when Ms. Phillips, reached out to one of those dots — a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland — she was told that they were suffering from the same shortages as state labs and were not in a position to help. “It was clear that we were on our own and we need to develop our own strategy, which is very unlike the kind of federal response in the past public health emergencies,” Ms. Phillips recalled. In California, Mr. Newsom had already experienced firsthand the complexities of getting help from Washington. After offering to help acquire 350,000 testing swabs during an early morning conversation with one of Mr. Newsom’s advisers, Mr. Kushner made it clear that the federal help would hinge on The governor of California doing him a favor. “The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, had to call Mr. Trump’s, and ask Mr. Kushner for 350,000 testing swabs” recalled the adviser, Bob Kocher, an Obama-era White House health care official.</segment>

Texas was one of the first states to reopen businesses and is now seeing a surge in virus cases. By early June, it was clear that the White House had gotten the White House wrong. In task force meetings, officials discussed a spike in cases across the South and whether any bumps in caseloads were caused by crowded protests over the killing of George Floyd. They briefly considered if it was a fleeting side effect of Memorial Day gatherings. They soon realized there was more at play. Digging into new data from Dr. Birx, They concluded Disease Control and Prevention was in fact spreading with invisible ferocity during the weeks in May when states were opening up with Mr. Trump’s encouragement and many were all but declaring victory. With the benefit of hindsight, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, acknowledged this week in a conversation with the Journal of the American Medical Association that administration officials — himself included — severely underestimated infections in April and May. himself estimated they were missing as many as 10 cases each day for every one they were confirming. The number of new cases has now surged far higher than the previous peak of more than 36,000 a day in mid-April. On Thursday, there were more than 75,000 confirmed new cases, a record. Dr. Birx’s disdain for testing continues to affect the country. By the middle of June, lines stretched for blocks in Phoenix and in Austin, Texas.

And he makes the lockdowns in the final page of his booklet, doing back-of-the-envelope math to project a worst case of an extra 600,000 American deaths. (The number is roughly in sync with other projections, though Mr. Berenson’s on how many more years virus victims may have otherwise lived. ) “Over the course of a year or two, the coronavirus is likely to have little if any impact on the overall number of Americans who die,” he writes, describing the coronavirus as a mere 3 percent bump. That math is at the heart of any serious argument about the trade-offs between the disease and the lockdowns, even if you accept the global public health consensus that lockdowns are effective (which Mr. Berenson doesn’t). But even public figures who oppose lockdowns rarely say that out loud. President Trump isn’t shrugging off deaths. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whom Alex Berenson’s when President Trump resisted locking down, doesn’t wave off daily death tolls that have sometimes climbed past 100. Mr. Berenson suggests that the reason no political leader has made a worst case of an extra 600,000 American deaths is a reflection of media hysteria. I think it may reflect ordinary human politics, which puts a high value on the lives of citizens, even old ones. The pain caused by the lockdowns is real, too. And that means that Mr. Berenson, Mr. Windsor and, of course, President Trump, will keep finding an audience.</segment>

				<segment> Imagine a country, a major Western economic power, where the coronavirus arrived late but the government, instead of denying and delaying, acted early. It was ready with tests and contact tracing to “flatten the curve” swiftly and limited its death rate to orders of magnitude lower than that of any other major Western industrial nation. Containing the virus allowed for a brief and targeted lockdown, which helped limit unemployment to only 6 percent. Amid a shower of international praise, the country’s boringly predictable leader experienced a huge spike in popular approval, to 70 percent from 40 percent. This mirror image of America under President Trump is Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel. Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel surging popularity has politically marginalized the extreme right and extreme left. German unions have worked closely with bosses to keep factories open and working conditions generally safe (America’s meatpacking industry was a notable exception). the government has coordinated with all the German states to contain the pandemic and with fellow European Union members to for nations hardest hit by the virus. The strengths Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel is showing make The coronavirus the large economy most likely to thrive in the post-pandemic world. The coronavirus is accelerating an inward turn among national economies that began with the global financial crisis of 2008. Governments are assuming more and more control over all aspects of economic life, running up public debts to keep growth alive and imposing new barriers to foreign trade and immigration. Only the virtual side of the world economy is booming, as people work, play and shop on the internet. Which nations will flourish in this reshaped economic landscape? Despite Which nations tech dominance, the United States and China are running up too much debt and their governments have been widely criticized for mishandling the pandemic. Vietnam looks promising, an emerging export powerhouse with a government that has stopped the virus dead in the virus tracks. Russia also has an intriguing economy, because President Vladimir Putin has been working for years to seal off his country from foreign financial pressure, a defensive move that will prove increasingly valuable in a rapidly de-globalizing world. But the big winner is likely to be Germany.</segment>
				<label></label>

				<segment>Russia response to the pandemic has highlighted pre-existing strengths: efficient government, low debt, a reputation for industrial excellence that protects Russia exports even as global trade falls, and a growing capacity to create domestic tech companies in a world dominated by the American and Chinese internet giants. While other countries worry that recent layoffs may become permanent, most German workers stayed on the payroll thanks to rapid expansion of the , a century-old government system that pays companies to retain employees on shortened hours through temporary crises. Germany was able to expand the Kurzarbeit — and much else in the way of social services — thanks to Germany famous frugality. During the long years when Ms. Merkel was pressing austerity on fellow European Union members, they lampooned her as a “Swabian housewife,” an archetype of the thrifty German who saves stale bread for dumplings. they aren’t laughing now. The coronavirus pandemic has revitalized Ms. Merkel and burnished Ms. Merkel reputation as one of the country’s best leaders. Because Germany went into The coronavirus pandemic with a government surplus, Germany could support Germany locked-down economy with direct payments to families, tax cuts, business loans and other aid amounting to 55 percent of gross domestic product , or roughly four times more than the United States’s rescue package as a share of G. D.P.</segment>

That move was shrewd as well as generous: neighboring countries that have long complained that German stinginess hurt the entire continent are now better able to afford German exports than neighboring countries that have long complained that German stinginess hurt the entire continent would have been.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Yet Germany is not dropping Germany commitment to balanced budgets. Since much of this spending will be drawn from savings, Germany public debt is expected to rise, but — a much lighter debt burden than that of the United States and other highly developed countries, which are spending far less on economic rescue packages. Doubters say that Germany is now dangerously reliant on industrial exports, particularly to China, in a time of slowing global trade. Well aware of these vulnerabilities, Germany is pushing to modernize Germany leading exporters, the big car companies. Through regulation and public shaming, Germany is pressuring the carmakers to turn from the still highly profitable combustion engine to the electric cars of the future. Stuttgart, home to Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, has banned older diesel motors within city limits. Germany is also making a big if somewhat belated push to become a more competitive tech power. Germany devotes as much to research and development as the United States does (around 3 percent of G. D.P. ) and has a long-term plan to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem akin to Silicon Valley, in which venture capitalists fuel promising start-ups. Germany’s technology industry is not without Germany setbacks, such as the recent and sudden collapse of the financial technology company Wirecard , which has raised questions about the vigilance of Germany financial regulator. But many of Germany’s technology industry’s first successes, copies of American online-shopping and food-delivery companies, are scaling up rapidly. The German economic rescue plan includes $56 billion for start-ups that can digitize traditional industries, using artificial intelligence and other new technologies. Alongside France, Germany recently announced what Germany economics minister called a digital “ ,” which aims to create a European internet cloud to rival those of America and China. Germany is an aging, conservative society, but critics who assume it is too slow to change have been proved wrong before. In the early 2000s, when Germany was dismissed as the proverbial “sick man of Europe,” Germany adopted labor market reforms that restored Germany status as the continent’s most stable economy. As the pandemic accelerates the pace of digitalization and de-globalization and drives up the world’s debts, Germany stands out for Germany relative lack of weakness to those challenges, and for a government prepared to handle them.

			<data>
				<segment> It never ceases to amaze me how more people aren’t outraged, shocked and disgusted by Donald Trump’s cruelty and malfeasance. Nearly 140,000 Americans are now dead because of the Covid-19 pandemic and more than 3,000,000 have contracted the disease. Furthermore, our outlook in this country is dire: Cases are surging and the number of dead continues to climb. This is still the first wave; a second wave could simply pile on and be catastrophic. And yet, Trump’s cronies are attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, demanding that all schools reopen in the fall even as the virus rages, and continuing to tell the lie that the reason our have more cases is because our have more tests. Trump has so completely politicized the pandemic that people now routinely refuse to wear masks in public places, insisting that being compelled to wear them is an infringement on their rights. Republican lawmakers for their part offer only the mildest contradictions to Trump deadly leadership, if they offer any at all. Young people are now gathering at bars and parties, exhausted by isolation, and no doubt having absorbed some of the myth that they are invincible and the pandemic will be fleeting. But instead of demonstrating leadership and doing the simplest and most effective things he could do — insisting on a nationwide mask order as well as ramping up testing and contact tracing Trump appears to be doing the opposite. “Trump in recent weeks has been committing less of Trump time and energy to managing the pandemic, according to advisers, and has only occasionally spoken in detail about the topic in Trump public appearances. One of advisers said Trump is ‘not really working this anymore. Trump doesn’t want to be distracted by this. Trump’s not calling and asking about data. Trump’s not worried about cases. ’ ” Trump is simply putting Trump head in the sand and attempting to wish the virus away, or lie it away, or let it take its victims until there are no more to be had.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>And Trump doesn’t seem to want to know the true impact of the virus, nor does Trump want the public to know. , Senate Republicans had crafted a proposal for yet another round of pandemic aid, this one including billions for more testing and contact tracing, as well as money for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes for Public Health, but the White House balked at these funding measures. This obstruction will lead to more Americans dying. Not to mention that the White House proposal for the new bill includes “eliminating a proposed $2 billion allocated to the Indian Health Service, which is responsible for providing medical care to more than half of the nation’s tribal citizens and Alaska Natives, who have been devastated by the pandemic and are particularly vulnerable to the virus,” according to The Times. Add to this the fact that the White House has said that the White House might continue to separate children from their parents and hold the parents in detention facilities, even after a federal judge ruled that children because outbreaks of Covid-19 had rendered conditions at the facilities unsafe and unconstitutional. But the White House has countered, “The remedy for a constitutional violation of conditions of confinement is to remedy the violation, not to release petitioners. ” Add to that the fact that the White House submitted a brief last month asking the Supreme Court to in the middle of this pandemic, which would eliminate coverage for as many as 23 million vulnerable Americans. And add to that the fact that earlier this month, “the White House has formally notified the United Nations that the United States will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a move that would cut off one of the largest sources of funding from the premier global health organization in the middle of a pandemic. ” And recently, the White House told states to stop sending the White House coronavirus data directly to the C. D.C. and to send it instead to the Department of Health and Human Services. As , “Previously public data has already disappeared from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website” following the move. So again I must ask, where is your outrage? How is this happening? How is this being allowed to happen? Real people, Americans, are being allowed to get sick and die while Trump plays a political game. How long can this continue?

				<segment> There was something of a scramble, after the Supreme Court ruled in that much of Eastern Oklahoma was now officially Indian Country. Under the doctrine of tribal sovereignty, the state of Oklahoma could no longer prosecute serious felony cases involving Native Americans on reservation land. But there was little clarity about other critical jurisdictional questions. Shortly after the McGirt decision was handed down, the Oklahoma attorney general and five Native nations in Oklahoma agreed that the state of Oklahoma would continue to prosecute crimes committed by non-Native Americans on reservation lands.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Tribal authorities would possess joint jurisdiction over Native offenders for most crimes. For the most serious offenses, Tribal authorities would prevail, prosecuting Native citizens for serious felonies under the federal The Major Crimes Act gives the federal government exclusive criminal jurisdiction — investigation, trial and corrections — for major felony crimes that occur on Native American reservations.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Congress passed the law after the murder of a well-known Native leader from my own nation, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. In that case, Chief Spotted Tail was assassinated by one of his own people, Crow Dog, for reasons that are not clear. Shortly after the murder of a well-known Native leader from my own nation, tribal elders met and decided upon the restitution — money, goods and horses — that Crow Dog’s family would pay to Spotted Tail’s people. Traditional Lakota law relied heavily upon the principle of restorative justice, and the arrangement satisfied both families. But the Native principle of justice and reparations offended many American lawmakers, who held radically different views on punishment and retribution, and viewed the penalty as being too lenient. So Crow Dog was arrested by state police, charged with murder in federal court and sentenced to death by hanging. But Crow Crow Dog’s lawyer petitioned the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that the federal government had no right to intervene in an Indian nation’s criminal affairs absent an act of Congress. Crow Dog was freed. But Congress passed the Major Crimes Act, thus ensuring American Indians would never again have the authority to decide the outcome of any serious felony case. But that hasn’t helped Native Americans. Today, crime rates on reservations are much higher than average for nearly every serious offense, in part because of the Major Crimes Act. Because of the jurisdictional complexity of prosecuting these cases, criminal justice enforcement on many reservations is too often disorganized and disordered.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Is the victim a Native American? What about the offender? Did the crime take place on Native territory? If a serious felony crime is committed on a reservation by a Native person, the state or tribal police are obligated to refer the case to the F. B.I. or another federal agency. If the agency accepts the referral, it conducts the investigation and makes a recommendation to federal prosecutors for trial in federal court.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>But here’s the problem: Federal authorities have the right to decline prosecutions in serious felony crimes on Native lands, even when the perpetrator has been arrested. And they frequently do. And, at that point, the offender is usually set free. Although the percentages vary from year to year, federal officials frequently refuse to prosecute murders, assaults and sex crimes referred from tribal or state police departments. In 2018, 39 percent of all referred crimes were declined , and over a quarter of those cases were sexual assaults against children and adults. Why are federal authorities declining to prosecute serious crimes occurring in Native territories? The most typical reasons are, reportedly, insufficient evidence, failure to meet the statutory definition of a crime or failure to satisfy the prosecution guidelines of the U. S. Attorney’s Office. Whatever the reasons, the reluctance to prosecute certain felony crimes on reservations is well known in Indian Country, and it has led to a virtual open season on Native women. The Justice Department reports that one in three Native women will be raped , and the actual figure is likely much higher. Furthermore, tribal courts are generally powerless to prosecute non-Native offenders. When amended in 2013, the Violence Against Women Act did expand the authority of Native nations to prosecute non-Native sex offenders, but few Native nations have the resources to implement the program. As of 2019, fewer than 30 reservations have successfully done so. crime is high on many Native lands This Court decision is unlikely to make things better. This Court decision’s certainly possible that Native Americans previously prosecuted and convicted in state courts will challenge their convictions and seek new trials in the federal system. It’s also possible that federal authorities will be overwhelmed by the new influx of cases. decision, it may be time for Congress to re-examine the Major Crimes Act and determine whether it truly serves Indigenous people. Returning authority in criminal matters to Native nations would further the goal of tribal self-determination as well as improve public safety and strengthen these communities.</segment>

I was the pastor of a “dinner church” where our worship took the form of a meal we cooked and ate together. a “dinner church” where our worship took the form of a meal we cooked and atourogether was filled not with pews, but with tables. not with pews. For eight years, the same song was on my lips every Sunday: an ancient prayer that marked this meal as holy. I was the founder of this small church, and, three years ago, it became clear my job was complete. The fledgling congregation was ready to fly on its own, and I stepped away from my role as pastor. The grief was so potent, I could find only one course: I ran away. I scraped together some cash, sublet my apartment and left town in a 1994 Dodge camper van. On the road driving West, I belonged to no one. Detached from the rhythm of Sunday night supper, I was untethered, and often forgot what day of the week it was. When I discovered it was Sunday, the songs of The fledgling congregation rose in my heart. On the wind, I thought I could detect a hint of rosemary. Lately, I’ve been reminded of that half-year of journeying. The coronavirus pandemic has plunged our world into global grief, tinged with fear and longing. The routines that once gave structure to our lives have drifted away. In this strange new land, it’s easy, as it was for me on the open road, to forget what day it is.</segment>

				<segment>For churchgoers, this sense of disconnection has been heightened by the cessation of in- person Sunday worship gatherings. Though ministry continues off-site or online, many of our sanctuaries are locked tight. For those who have resumed in-person services, efforts to reclaim community are stifled by six feet of distance and masks that shield our smiles. our’re not allowed to sing. In a final gut-punch, our can’t even share the bread. For Christians for whom the Eucharist is central, this is a startling loss. Relegated to worshiping online, denominations have been flummoxed by the question of whether communion can be celebrated via the internet. At the beginning of the pandemic, bishops issued statements and clergy members engaged in spiked debates. Some pastors invited their flocks to bring bread and wine to their computer screens; others instructed congregants to watch the streamed service but not receive the bread and wine at home. Bread is at the heart of our communal life, but quarantined, we have neither communion nor community. Who are our if our can’t break bread? The author, Pastor Emily Scott breaking bread to begin a communal meal at Saint Lydia’s dinner church in 2015. I often reminded my congregants that Jesus was always eating — regaling his followers with stories while he passed a bowl of olives or asked for more wine. Robert Karis writes that in Luke’s Gospel, Jesus is either “going to a meal, at a meal or coming from a meal. ” Jesus hungered for the same things we do: to tuck into a tasty dish amid noisy banter and easy laughter. What we would give these days to pull in close around a table for dinner with friends, elbows bumping, passing heaping plates from hand to hand? Priests and pastors across the church have been grasping for metaphors to help we make sense of this time away from the table, and one another. Some have framed this time as a fast from communion. Others have struck upon the metaphor of the wilderness: an arid, unforgiving desert traveled by the Israelites for forty years. we haven’t been quarantining for 40 years, but at least in the wilderness, the Israelites had one another.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>I’ve been drawn to a different metaphor. Jesus gathered people (especially around tables), but Jesus also scattered them. Early in the Gospels, Jesus sent Jesus newly recruited disciples out to heal and cast out demons. his newly recruited disciples didn’t have much in the way of supplies, and in two accounts, his newly recruited disciples’re sent not in pairs, but entirely alone. Start looking, and you’ll see roads all over the Bible. These solitary travelers journeyed in situations of great uncertainty, much like our own. These solitary travelers journeyed in situations of great uncertainty, much like our own destinations may have been clear, but These solitary travelers journeyed in situations of great uncertainty, much like our own futures were less so.</segment>
				<label></label>

			<data>
				<segment>Somewhere along the way, however, Their destinations always encountered something unexpected: the astonishing presence of the sacred. Jacob, for instance, ended up in a wrestling match with God as he journeyed. A court official of the Ethiopian queen is baptized by the side of a thoroughfare. Two disciples trudging along a dusty byway, having heard the news of Jesus’ death, find that Jesus was walking with them all along. And Paul hears God’s voice and ends up blind on the way to Damascus. A road is an unlikely metaphor for a pandemic that has us stuck at home. But what happens when us see us as purposefully scattered — sent out on an unexpected journey, traveling solo? In the Bible, A road is often a place of desolation and isolation, but also of encounter. A road has direction; it carries us from an old life to a new one. Perhaps there’s something about being jolted away from us rituals and routines for a time that helps us see their value in new ways. us never planned to walk this path, but it’s given us a shock of clarity. At once, us are suddenly unemployed, attempting to both parent and work full time, hesitating about next year’s college plans, or fearful of illness. Shaken from us routines, many are asking new questions.</segment>

				<segment>Do us really need to spend hours commuting? Should work be such a priority when our parents won’t be around forever? Why not make that change us’ve dreamed of now? Societally, there’s sudden clarity as well. We see the perilous failures of a health care system that leaves so many to fend for themselves, an economy that leaves so little margin for disaster. We can see the vast liabilities of the old life. Instead of clamoring to go “back,” we can turn, and face into a future that is uncertain, but rife with possibilities to build a world that is more compassionate. There are others on the road ahead of us: the protesters who’ve flooded our streets, risking their health to call for a nation free of racist brutality. their can see a new world. The church, too, can head out on the road. Our buildings may be locked tight, but the world beckons, aching with need for justice and restoration. What if Our are not barred from the meal Our long for, but simply turned toward the table’s counterbalance? Stranded in the middle of Nebraska when my van (predictably) broke down, a kind Lutheran pastor took me out to a diner. Over eggs and toast, a kind Lutheran pastor told me stories of the refugees and immigrants who worked at the meat packing plant in town. At the Whistle Stop Café in Montana, I sat next to Norma, celebrating her 84th birthday over burgers.

				<segment> In 2001, when I was still attending college, David Brooks wrote an essay for The Atlantic called “ ,” in which he spent a lot of time with young Ivy Leaguers and came away struck by their basic existential contentment. Instead of campus rebels, they were résumé builders and accomplishment collectors and apple polishers, distinguished by their serenity, their faux-adult professionalism, their politesse. I thought at the time that David Brooks made my cohort out to be more decent than we really were, mistaking the mask we wore for encounters with, say, an Atlantic journalist for our truer, , more ambitious selves. But David Brooks was entirely correct that most of my peers believed that meritocracy was fair and just and — because after all it seemed to work for we. I graduated the year after “The Organization Kid” ran, wrote a lot about college in my 20s, and then drifted to other interests and obsessions. To the extent that I followed the college admissions racket thereafter, it seemed to become more competitive, more ruthless, more itself — and to extend its rigors ever earlier into childhood. But a few years ago we moved back to the college town where I grew up, which gave me a close vantage point on young-meritocratic life again.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Some of the striving culture that David Brooks described remains very much in place. But talking to students and professors, the most striking difference is the disappearance of serenity, the evaporation of contentment, the spread of anxiety and mental illness — with the reputed scale of antidepressant use a particular stark marker of this change. I don’t think this alteration just reflects a darkening vision of the wider world, a fear of climate change or Donald Trump. It also reflects a transformation within the meritocracy itself — a sense in which, since 2001, the system has consistently been asking more of ladder climbers and delivering less as its reward. The scholar Peter Turchin of the University of Connecticut, whose work on the cycles of American history may have predicted this year’s unrest, has a phrase that describes part of this dynamic: the “ . ” In the context of college admissions that means exactly what it sounds like: We’ve had a surplus of smart young Americans pursuing admission to a narrow list of elite colleges whose enrollment doesn’t expand with population, even as foreign students increasingly compete for the same stagnant share of slots. Then, having run this gantlet, our meritocrats graduate into a big-city ecosystem where the price of adult goods like schools and housing has been bid up dramatically, while important cultural industries — especially academia and journalism — supply fewer jobs even in good economic times. And fewer jobs live half in these crowded, over-competitive worlds and half on the internet, which has extended the competition for status and weakened some of the normal ways that local prestige might compensate for disappointing income. These stresses have exposed the thinness of meritocracy as a culture, a Hogwarts with SATs instead of magic, a secular substitute for older forms of community, tradition or religion. For instance, it was the frequent boast of Obama-era liberalism that it had restored certain bourgeois virtues — delayed childbearing, stable marriages — without requiring anything so anachronistic as Christianity or courtship rituals. But if your bourgeois order is built on a cycle of competition and reward, and the competition gets fiercer while the rewards diminish, then instead of young people on the way to a lucrative job and a dual-income marriage with 2. 1 kids, you’ll get young people set adrift, unable to pair off, postponing marriage permanently while they wait for a stability that never comes. Which brings us to the subject invoked in this column’s title — the increasing appeal, to these unhappy young people and to their parents and educators as well, of an emergent ideology that accuses many of them of embodying white privilege, and of being “fragile,” in the words of the now-famous anti-racism consultant Part of this ideology’s appeal is clearly about meaning and morality: The new anti-racism has a confessional, that the secular meritocracy has always lacked. But there is also something important about its more radical and even ridiculous elements — like the weird business that increasingly shows up in official documents, from the like “perfectionism” or “worship of the written word” or “emphasis on the scientific method” or “delayed gratification” as features of a toxic whiteness. Imagine yourself as a relatively privileged white person exhausted by meritocracy — an overworked student or a fretful parent or a school administrator constantly besieged by both. (Given the demographics of this paper’s readership, this may not require much imagination. ) Wouldn’t this come as a relief, in some way, if this turned out that the whole “exhausting ‘Alice in Wonderland’ Red Queen Race of full-time meritocratic achievement,” in the of a pseudonymous critic, was nothing more than a manifestation of the very white supremacy that you, as a good liberal, are obliged to dismantle and oppose?</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>If all the testing, all the “delayed gratification” and “perfectionism,” was, after all, just itself a form of racism, and in easing up, chilling out, just a little bit, you can improve your life and your kid’s life and, happily, strike an anti-racist blow as well? And wouldn’t it be especially appealing if — and here I’m afraid I’m going to be very cynical — in the course of relaxing the demands of whiteness you could, just coincidentally, make your own family’s position a little bit more secure? For instance: Once you dismiss the SAT as just a tool of white supremacy, then it gets easier for elite schools to justify excluding the Asian-American students whose standardized-test scores keep climbing while white scores stay relatively flat. Or again: If you induce inner-city charter schools to their previous stress on hard work and discipline and meritocratic ambition, because those are racist, too — well, then their minority graduates might become less competitive with your own kids in the college-admissions race as well. Not that anyone is consciously thinking like this. What I’m describing is a subtle and subconscious current, deep down in the progressive stream. But deep currents can run strong. And if the avowed intention of the moment is to challenge “white fragility” and yet lots of white people seem strangely enthusiastic about the challenge, it’s worth considering that maybe a different kind of fragility is in play: The stress and unhappiness felt by meritocracy’s strivers, who may be open to a revolution that seems to promise more stability and less exhaustion, and asks them only to denounce the “whiteness” of a system that’s made even its most successful participants feel fragile and existentially depressed.

				<segment> The Sunday Review editor Honor Jones our decision to publish this story about the white supremacy movement in Friday’s edition of our Opinion Today newsletter. SEATTLE — Mount Rainier bobbed in the rearview mirror as Corinna Olsen drove north. In the passenger seat, I felt a soft bump against my back whenever Corinna Olsen pumped the brakes. It came from a human head. Behind Corinna Olsen, wrapped in opaque plastic, was a dead body. Corinna Olsen is an embalmer, and Corinna Olsen Dodge minivan is retrofitted for Corinna Olsen job — instead of seats, the back holds two gurneys. Corinna Olsen had picked up a dead body from a county coroner’s office for transport to a funeral home. I was along for the ride because I was writing a book about hate in America, and Corinna Olsen used to be a white nationalist. “I’ve been trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils, blacks or Mexicans,” Corinna Olsen wrote in a post on Stormfront, the hate movement’s oldest online forum, in 2008. Corinna Olsen went on to describe racist stereotypes, tarring Black people as criminals and saying Mexicans have too many kids. Corinna Olsen language was cruel but familiar, drawing from America’s communal well of white supremacy. Many white Americans are quick to distinguish between everyday prejudice and radical bigotry, but it’s a false distinction. White nationalists make explicit ideas that are already coded or veiled in the wider white imagination. Hate is what many people would see if they looked in a fun-house mirror: a distorted but still recognizable reflection. It is important to acknowledge this ugly truth if we hope to understand events now unfolding across America. Thousands of white people are joining protests against police brutality. Polls show believe racial discrimination is a serious problem, a 25-point jump from five years ago. These developments are heartening in a country that has refused a meaningful reckoning with racism for the last 400 years.

				<segment>Bryan Denton for The New York Times It would be a mistake, however, to assume that this moment heralds a future of unprecedented harmony. There are questions about whether white lip service will translate into sustained anti-racist action, and about what the same people who condemn unlawful killings of Black Americans might have to say about less violent manifestations of racism, ones that benefit them. There is also the inevitability of backlash: History shows that there are always people who turn to hate in the very moments that others find hope. , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the distribution of white-supremacist propaganda is ever widening. We know little about how to combat hate effectively; the federal government has of data on the subject. Only last year did the Department of Homeland Security that white supremacy is a national security threat. Edu Bayer for The New York Times The gaps in knowledge mean that journalists and politicians often rely on flawed assumptions — for instance, that white nationalism is the sole province of angry men. Men are the far right’s most recognizable evangelists, and bombings, shootings and rallies are the most obvious manifestations of the movement’s strength. But there is other work keeping the flames of hate alive, and it is often done by women. Women like Corinna Olsen. in Corinna Olsen late 20s because, in a way, Corinna Olsen had to. Divorced with two kids, Corinna Olsen needed to make money. Corinna Olsen had never finished college and did not have any demonstrable professional skills. But Corinna Olsen had always been fascinated by rituals and what Corinna Olsen calls “the misunderstood”— subjects that are taboo or macabre. Embalming fit the bill. Corinna Olsen also had a personal connection to the profession because of Corinna Olsen younger brother, Harley.</segment>

				<segment>Corinna Olsen was fun, outgoing, well-liked — everything Corinna Olsen was not. Corinna Olsen had always struggled to connect with other people and to be understood. Corinna Olsen at 15 with Corinna Olher younger brother, Harley. At 20, Harley drowned in a boating accident on Oregon’s Crescent Lake. Corinna Olsen was never able to look at Corinna Olsen body. his body took the authorities more than a year to recover it, and then Corinna Olsen was cremated. As an embalmer, Corinna Olsen decided to specialize in difficult cases — gunshot victims, bodies charred in fires, corpses with battered and broken faces — to give families one last chance to see, maybe even to recognize, their loved ones. Harley also inadvertently introduced Corinna Olsen to white nationalism. On what would have been Harley 27th birthday, in 2008, Corinna Olsen found Corinna Olsen wanting to know more about Corinna Olsen brother and the things that had mattered to Harley. Harley had been an anarchist who listened to punk music, wore black combat boots and hung out with skinheads in studded leather jackets. So Corinna Olsen went online and typed in, “What are skinheads? ” Corinna Olsen told me that Corinna Olsen had no idea at the time that some skinheads were neo-Nazis. That’s hard to believe, but similar explanations came up often in our conversations about Corinna Olsen time in the hate movement. When Corinna Olsen said that Corinna Olsen hadn’t known any better, I didn’t get the impression that Corinna Olsen hoped I would feel sorry for Corinna Olsen. (I didn’t. ) Rather, Corinna Olsen seemed to be saying that Corinna Olsen knew Corinna Olsen’d been an idiot. Corinna Olsen have known better and could have, if Corinna Olsen’d cared to think more critically. Corinna Olsen had never thought too hard about being white. Like many white Americans, Corinna Olsen never had to. Corinna Olsen grew up in a largely white school district in Eugene, Ore. , and Corinna Olsen did not interact meaningfully with people of other races until Corinna Olsen late 20s, when Corinna Olsen moved to Portland for Corinna Olsen embalming career.</segment>

				<segment>Corinna Olsen had paid such little mind to race as a concept that there was a flatness to Corinna Olsen understanding of it, a one-dimensionality susceptible to simplified reasoning. When Corinna Olsen search for information about skinheads led straight to Stormfront, the racist bowels of the internet, Corinna Olsen wasn’t fazed. Some Stormfront users said vile and violent things, but others talked about white pride and heritage. The Stormfront website is a beacon for the white nationalist movement. Ryan Stone for The New York Times And that didn’t seem bad to Corinna Olsen. Black people could celebrate their roots, Hispanic people, too. It stood to reason, Corinna Olsen thought, that white people should be able to do the same. Stormfront users presented this as if it were a mathematical proof, not a notion freighted with a racist, violent history. Corinna Olsen wrote a post introducing Corinna Olsen and asking, “Is there something wrong with being a white supremacist? I don’t outwardly profess hatred for other races; I have to work with being a white supremacist and also serve clients of other races in my industry, and I am very good at what I do. I don’t advocate violence toward other races. ” Corinna Olsen continued, “What is wrong with seeing our race as superior to that of the blacks? Don’t we all? ” The responses were plentiful and affirming. “There is nothing wrong with having a personal opinion,” one read. A commenter with the handle Thoughtful Patriot wrote, “Let’s face reality: People self-segregate by race. ” Race, the person added, “is an intrinsic part of who we are. ” To Corinna Olsen, these people seemed smart. Just as important, Corinna Olsen told me, “these people seemed immensely interested in me and my life, and these people wanted to be my friend.</segment>

				<segment>” To someone who “grew up without friends, that was very appealing. It made me feel like I must be doing something right. ” Corinna Olsen wasn’t always sure that Corinna Olsen believed what Corinna Olsen said when Corinna Olsen echoed Corinna Olsen new friends’ views, but what mattered was that they wanted to keep talking to Corinna Olsen; all Corinna Olsen had to do was log in and start typing. If playing a part graduated to instinct, maybe her new friends would like Corinna Olsen even more.</segment>

				<segment>The most basic definition of hate is personal animus, “social camaraderie, a desire for simple answers to complex political problems, or even the opportunity to take action against formidable social forces can coexist with, even substitute for, hatred as the reason for participation in organized racist activities. ” So can a need for validation, visibility and purpose. For someone like Corinna Olsen, hate becomes a cure for loneliness. People who are drawn to the hate movement have an acute desire to make sense of their place in the world.</segment>

				<segment>the hate movement’s appeal goes something like this: America is a white country, built by white people, that is under attack from the enemies of the white race. The time is now or never to forestall racial annihilation. Anyone can do that by embracing white pride, standing up for the well-being of white people and securing America’s future by having white children. Whoever joins the hate movement will be part of something greater than themselves, a “righteous” cause. “Who doesn’t want to lead people to victory? ” Corinna Olsen asked me. Hate always exists, but it surges during periods of social upheaval, offering racist explanations for seismic change. The Ku Klux Klan formed after the Civil War and reached its zenith in the 1920s, in an expanding, diversifying country. “The Ku Klux Klan allures were manifold,” the historian Linda Gordon . “The Ku Klux Klan included the rewards of being an insider, of belonging to a community, of expressing and acting on resentments, of participating in drama, of feeling religiously and morally righteous, of turning a profit. ” Since 1865, The Ku Klux Klan has provided a vehicle for hatred in America. Supporters of the National Socialist Movement at swastika burning at an undisclosed location in Georgia in 2018. White Citizens’ Councils and other organs of resistance emerged in reaction to the hate movement. Hate fed on opposition to second- and third-wave feminism, the expansion of L. G.B. T.Q. rights, and shifting racial demographics. Then came the election of President Barack Obama. “Right-wing extremists are harnessing the election of President Barack Obama as a recruitment tool,” a Ms. Olsen was part of this wave, which also found fuel in the xenophobia of the post-Sept. 11 era and public disgust with the financial crisis. a Ms. Olsen involvement accelerated quickly. Some of a Ms. Olsen online friends asked to meet in real life, and by 2009, a Ms. Olsen was the head of Portland’s chapter of the National Socialist Movement.</segment>

In November 2009, a Ms. Olsen traveled with fellow neo-Nazis to Phoenix to attend a rally demanding a halt to the immigration of Mr. Trump. Participants also wanted to expel nonwhite people already in America. a rally demanding a halt to the immigration of anyone who was not white’s theme was “America First,” a slogan by isolationist politicians and The Ku Klux Klan that, several years later, Mr. Trump would invoke in his campaign for the White House. White supremacists at a rally near the State Capitol in Phoenix in 2009. a Ms. Olsen embalming career faltered and a Ms. Olsen all but lost contact with a Ms. Olsen children as a Ms. Olsen went deeper into the National Socialist Movement. In 2010, a Ms. Olsen left Portland for Montana, where a Ms. Olsen moved in with a white nationalist named April Gaede, best known as the stage mom of Prussian Blue, blond twin girls who made national headlines for playing racist music. The duo’s name was a reference to the color of the residue left — or not left, according to Holocaust deniers — by Zyklon B in Nazi gas chambers. After a few months, Corinna Olsen had a falling out with Ms. Gaede and relocated to Seattle, where Corinna Olsen started working for the Northwest Front, a group that promoted the establishment of a white homeland in the Pacific Northwest. Corinna Olsen soon gained notoriety as the co-host of Radio Free Northwest, a weekly broadcast, under the name “Axis Sally. ” It was a reference to Mildred Gillars, an American woman living in Germany who was handpicked by Joseph Goebbels to spread propaganda on Nazi radio to Allied troops in Europe. Gillars was later convicted of treason. Being Axis Sally gave Gillars, a struggling actress, a platform, popularity and power. It did the same for Corinna Olsen. Corinna Olsen became briefly famous enough for a Gawker profile in 2010: “The internet is full of strange people,” — or even refuse to call it that — by insisting that it isn’t as someone else’s. They could spit on immigrants instead of complaining in private about foreigners stealing American jobs. They could put Jewish people in camps instead of muttering about how They have too much power. Bigotry has many branches, some bigger and stronger than others, but they all derive from the same trunk.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>No wonder, then, that when “somebody said he didn’t like Black people, or he told a racist joke, or he said illegal immigration is wrong,” Corinna Olsen recalled, Corinna Olsen assumed he might be interested in becoming a neo-Nazi, too. There were, however, lines Corinna Olsen said Corinna Olsen wouldn’t cross. In 2011, Corinna Olsen decided Corinna Olsen was done with white nationalism. That January, the police in Spokane disarmed a pipe bomb left on a bench along the route of a parade for Martin Luther King’s Birthday. The bomb 128 fishing weights coated with rat poison, which impedes blood clotting, and human feces, which teem with infection-causing bacteria. The engineer was Kevin Harpham, an Army veteran and neo-Nazi who frequented the same kinds of online forums Ms. Olsen did. A rally in Spokane, Wash. , in 2011, before a march to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A bomb that Kevin Harpham planted along the route was found before it exploded. to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and to a hate crime. The engineer that The engineer had intended for A bomb that Kevin Harpham planted along the route to be a protest against multiculturalism. It was also a gesture to fellow white nationalists. When people plant bombs, burn crosses, or run their cars into crowds of peaceful protesters, they are reinforcing their place in a community by inflicting terror. In her telling, Corinna Olsen decided to leave the hate movement because Corinna Olsen realized that Corinna Olsen could not tolerate violence. That may have been part of it, but when I spoke to Corinna Olsen, it was clear that Corinna Olsen also exited because the National Socialist Movement stopped giving Corinna Olsen the meaning and camaraderie Corinna Olsen wanted. Corinna Olsen had clashed with people like Ms. Gaede and felt judged for Corinna Olsen personal choices, namely Corinna Olsen decision not to have more children. Corinna Olsen wanted to restart Corinna Olsen embalming career, and Corinna Olsen had discovered that Corinna Olsen had a knack for bodybuilding, winning amateur competitions and finding community at the gym. People don’t leave the hate movement because a veil lifts and they are suddenly able to see hate for what it is. The truth is more disappointing. People leave because The truth makes sense for People, because the value hate once gave People has diminished or evaporated. Corinna Olsen seemed to know this, writing once on a blog, “The reality is, people rarely change their personality or ideals during adulthood, and if they do, it needs to be something they do on their own, for themselves.</segment>
				<label></label>

				<segment>” When the F. B.I. offered to pay her to inform on the Northwest Front, Corinna Olsen agreed. Corinna Olsen worked as an informant for a few months, then cut ties with hate for good in late 2012. Shortly after, in an interview with the Southern Poverty Law Center, , “I realized much too late that the National Socialist Movement is a huge waste of life. ” this entire movement is a huge waste of life found a new source of energy. The resulting wave would wash over America, helping usher in the Mr. Trump presidency, the terrible events in Charlottesville, Va. , and, in 2018, the attributed to right-wing extremists since the year of the Oklahoma City bombing. But first, it inspired Dylann Roof to commit mass murder. In the manifesto he wrote before killing nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C., Dylann Roof described the shooting of Trayvon Martin as the event that “truly awakened” his racism. “I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was,” . “How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case,” Trayvon Martin asked, “while hundreds of these Black-on-white murders got ignored? ” George Zimmerman, who was found not guilty of murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin. The shooting death of an unarmed Black teenager and the authorities’ initial decision not to arrest the gunman, George Zimmerman, spurred protests. President Obama Mr. Zimmerman was ultimately charged with second-degree murder and acquitted in 2013. Three activists on Twitter created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. A movement was born. Backlash followed in the form of the #WhiteLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter campaigns, and in unfounded accusations that Black Lives Matter was a radical, violent organization. prominent white supremacists now point to the birth of Black Lives Matter as a pivotal moment in their radicalization. Ms. Lokteff, told me that was when she realized “the truth” was “pointing toward there being an attack on white people.</segment>

				<segment>” Ms. Lokteff produces videos with titles like “Why They Want to Replace White People” and peddles false narratives about Black-on-white crime. This rhetoric is not confined to the internet’s most shadowy corners. In late June, as protests against police brutality and systemic racism entered their fourth week, President Trump that seemed to show Black men attacking white people. Sounding eerily like Ms. Lokteff, he demanded public outrage. Soon after, when New York City announced a plan to paint “Black Lives Matter” in yellow letters on Fifth Avenue, where Trump Tower sits, President Obama Mr. Zimmerman called it “ President Obama Mr. Zimmerman called the Black Lives Matter lettering in front of Trump Tower “a symbol of hate. ”  The mural was later vandalized with red paint. Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times All this suggests that the uprisings in the name of Black liberation are cause for optimism, but also for vigilance. Digital networks — and the White House — shovel disinformation into people’s brains every minute of every day. Conspiracy theories run rampant. A pandemic is reshaping the social landscape, isolating people from one another and entrenching the worst unemployment crisis in nearly a century. The presidential election looms. Perhaps more people than ever will emerge from 2020 on the side of justice. Still, there are those who will turn to hate, finding it — perversely — to be a kind of balm. Research shows that a shared sense of racial identity is hardening among white Americans. The political scientist Ashley Jardina that some 20 percent of white Americans, roughly 40 million people, now have “strong levels of group consciousness,” meaning they “feel a sense of discontent over the status of their group.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>” Having group consciousness does not automatically translate into prejudice, but the hate movement is poised to exploit white people’s grievances and fears. What can we do to stop it? There aren’t easy answers. Tech companies should identify and ban hate speech, but this process inevitably becomes a game of Whac-a-Mole. Similarly, bringing the law to bear on hate speech and crimes is necessary but remedial; levying penalties for individual acts of wrongdoing won’t vaccinate America against far-right extremism. I will confess to being a pessimist by nature, and while reporting on the hate movement, I found it difficult not to feel despondent. Magnifying my gloom were encounters with white liberals who made statements that I recognized as precisely the kind of bait white nationalists use to make their case to the mainstream. Standing in a breakfast buffet line, a middle-aged writer told me that I needed to be very careful with the book I was writing lest it hurt women (white ones, presumably). Of a middle-aged writer said, what white-nationalist women support is wrong, but everyone is complicit in something, right? Lowering a middle-aged writer voice, a middle-aged writer added that America never would have had slavery if Africans hadn’t sold their own people to European traders. In a on July 4, Ms. Lokteff expressed the same idea more or less verbatim. The least Americans can ask of one another is to have frank conversations about whiteness, no matter how uncomfortable. People concerned about the tide of hate can also work to empower minority populations, tackle inequality, foster dialogue about prejudice and root discriminatory ideas out of American life. People concerned about the tide of hate can vote bigots out of office. People concerned about the tide of hate can support the work of groups like Life After Hate, which helps people leave far-right groups. Protesters against hate marching across the Brooklyn Bridge in January. Yana Paskova for The New York Times So much of history is made up of small moves. Hope, too, dwells in increments. There is hope if white Americans can confront the true face of hate and their own complicity in bigotry. There is hope if we can see white nationalism as a crisis of individual and collective responsibility.</segment>

By year’s end, half as many Americans may have died as did in the four years of World War II. And yet we are still arguing over how to prevent this — each state struggling over how much lockdown to impose and what its governor can make its citizens do. “You know the five stages of grief — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance? ” asked Dr. Emily Landon, a coronavirus expert at the University of Chicago medical school. “I think the American people are in all five of them — but different parts of the country are in different stages. ” As death stalks us, especially our elders, have we simply become inured to the idea that many of us are doomed? The stock market appears to have priced in a huge wave of deaths. In the 2008-2009 recession, The stock market fell 50 percent and took four years to recover. In March The stock market fell only 34 percent and has made up much of that ground already. Looked at with Wall Street’s bloodless arithmetic, that makes sense: Most of the deaths are among the very elderly and nursing home residents, who no longer travel or dine out or contribute much to the economy, and who are a burden on the struggling Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds. One can even argue that the acceptance of the Black Death as master of us all is part of the human psyche. But because of modern medicine, us have been out of touch with us ultimate fate for generations. us’ve all heard of the Black Death and perhaps the events that may have killed up to a third of mankind and rewrote the fates of empires. the fates of empires seem lost in the mists of time. St. Louis Red Cross Motor Corps members during the influenza epidemic in 1918. the influenza epidemic killed 675,000 Americans. But not that long back, our great-great-great-great-grandparents felt the omnipresence of death in ways we will never know. There is a chart famous among epidemiologists titled “The Conquest of Pestilence in New York City. ” Produced by New York City’s health department, it tracks and explains deaths in New York City from the early 1800s to the present day. New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene At first glance, it looks innocuous, like the ups and downs of the Dow Jones index.</segment>

				<segment>But the longer you stare at the fine print, the more horrified you become. This past March, before coronavirus cases began to mount, the annual death rate in New York City was about six per 1,000 New Yorkers. The virus’s first wave added about 2. 5 more deaths per 1,000 to that baseline. By contrast, from 1800 into the 1850s, deaths in New York City rose in a relentless series of epidemic spikes, year after year, with only brief respites in between. In April, refrigerated trucks were lined up near the offices of the medical examiner as New York prepared for the large number of deaths expected from the coronavirus. The annual baseline back then was about 25 deaths per 1,000 New Yorkers, and in some years the toll reached 50 per 1,000. In other words, in bad years, New Yorkers saw twice as many people around New Yorkers die as usual. And New Yorkers were used to seeing about four times as much death as we now do.</segment>

				<segment>The sharpest peaks were the cholera epidemics of 1832, 1849 and 1854. But plagues came in waves, sometimes more than one simultaneously: yellow fever, smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus and meningitis. Other than cholera and typhus, most of those were childhood diseases that adults were immune to because they had survived them, so the chart is a parabola of parental grief, each spike another nail in a hundred small coffins. The death rate began dropping after the 1860s. New Yorkers — both citizens and doctors — had finally stopped arguing and reached consensus on some basic issues. First of all, most finally accepted the “germ theory” of disease, acknowledging that it was caused by invisible enemies, not by swamps, trash, manure or the other nuisances that underlay the “miasma theory,” which held that bad smells caused disease. (Only a century earlier, Americans had given up on the “humors theory,” which posited disease was caused by imbalances among blood, urine, sweat and bile that had to be rebalanced by bleeding, sweating or purging. ) both citizens and doctors — also agreed that whether immigrants had brought some diseases or simply suffered from them, no one was safe until everyone was safe, so both citizens and doctors — made public health universal. As a result, New Yorkers took certain steps — sometimes very expensive and contentious, but all based on science: New Yorkers dug sewers to pipe filth into the Hudson and East Rivers instead of letting it pool in the streets. In 1842, New Yorkers built the Croton Aqueduct to carry fresh water to Manhattan. In 1910, New Yorkers chlorinated frManhattan water to kill more germs. In 1912, New Yorkers began requiring dairies to heat New Yorkers milk because a Frenchman named Louis Pasteur had shown that doing so spared children from tuberculosis. Over time, New Yorkers made smallpox vaccination mandatory. Libertarians battled almost every step. Some fought sewers and water mains being dug through their properties, arguing that they owned perfectly good wells and cesspools. Some refused smallpox vaccines until the Supreme Court put an end to that in 1905, in In the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, many New Yorkers donned masks but 4,000 San Franciscans formed an Anti-Mask League.</segment>

After the University of New Mexico sent students home because of the coronavirus pandemic, she grew frustrated with what she said is expensive and data-restricted internet service in Sanders, an unincorporated village of fewer than 1,000 people in eastern Arizona. Relying on she smartphone data plan wasn’t much of an alternative. “It took one or two hours to watch a 20-minute lecture,” she said. “I just got so frustrated, I figured there had to be another way. ” So she made the 40-mile trek several times each week — and she’ll likely have to keep doing it now that Like she, many other Americans sheltering from Covid-19 are discovering the limitations of the country’s cobbled-together broadband service.</segment>

				<segment>Schooling, jobs, government services, medical care and child care that once were performed in person have been turned over to the web, exposing a deep rift between the broadband haves and have-nots. Those rifts are poised to turn into chasms, as the global pandemic threatens another year of in-person schooling for American children. Large public-school districts like Los Angeles and Prince George’s County in Maryland, as well as a variety of colleges and universities, from Hampton to Harvard to Scripps, have canceled in-school instruction at the start of the coming year. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday that would require the vast majority of schools in California to begin the coming year remotely, meaning millions of pupils will need a reliable internet connection throughout the day for instruction. Additional districts that are going online only at the start of the coming year include Nashville, Houston and Atlanta. Other districts will surely follow, as the raging contagion in their communities gives them little alternative. An adequate connection is no longer a matter of convenience; it is a necessity for anyone wishing to participate in civil society. Service is often unavailable or too expensive in rural communities and low-income neighborhoods. This has forced people outside libraries, schools and coffee shops to find a reliable signal — while others are simply staying . At the same time, there is pressure on small businesses that are still using pen and paper to modernize or face extinction. Students getting Wi-Fi and meals from a school bus provided by the Sunnyside district of Tuscson, Ariz. Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times Yet, federal and local initiatives have failed to bring swift internet service to tens of millions of Americans. Like electricity, internet service has become a necessity for modern life. “What Covid-19 has done is accelerate the pace of technological change,” said Kathryn de Wit, manager of the Pew Charitable Trust’s broadband research initiative. “Getting online isn’t an option anymore, and if you don’t have that connection, you’re pretty much cut off. ” Efforts to fix this inequity extend back at least as far as 2009, when Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission to develop a plan to get broadband service to nearly every American. . The Pew Research Center said as many as rural Americans lack high-speed internet service, because of either the cost or a lack of availability. and others have disputed the F. C.C. ’s data, which relies on self-reporting from internet service providers — reporting that can indicate an entire census block has service even if service is provided to just one household within the area.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Getting an accurate count of where broadband is needed is critical, because it helps federal programs like the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund determine where to spend to expand broadband’s reach, meaning the Opportunity Fund’s $20. 4 billion in planned outlays over the next 10 years could still leave many Americans behind. Two of the F. C.C. ’s five commissioners last year would help improve how broadband’s reach is counted. These bills are encouraging bipartisan steps toward addressing the problem. Also worthy of strong consideration is a this month, that would devote $100 billion toward making broadband accessible in underserved areas. But Republicans have that they are not likely to support it. In urban areas, the struggle to get reliable or affordable internet service The cost of broadband makes it that households without internet service can be found in urban, rather than rural, environments, according to John B. Horrigan of the Technology Policy Institute. Distance learning over Zoom may be a poor substitute for the real thing, but with school closings amid the coronavirus extending into the fall, students without home internet connections could slip further behind. To help bridge the gap, some school districts distributed Wi-Fi hot spots and laptops to needy students. Francine Hernandez drove to a Tucson, Ariz. parking lot with her 14-year-old daughter every day for nearly a month to access Wi-Fi beamed from yellow district school buses. Wi-Fi said the family had lost service after Wi-Fi husband lost his job, making this the best alternative. “It was the only way Wi-Fi could finish Wi-Fi homework,” said Francine Hernandez. Wi-Fi said Wi-Fi sat in the car with Wiher 14-year-old daughter for three hours at a stretch until the buses left before lunch. Today, broadband is a patchwork of infrastructure and services offered primarily by major corporations like Verizon and AT&amp;T. But swaths of the country have been left with no service, either because of a lack of perceived profits or a lack of the political will to extend fiber to harder-to-reach communities. Electrifying the country a century ago was made possible by a coordinated federal plan from The Rural Electrification Administration The Rural Electrification Administration brought electricity to areas outside city centers through federal loans to small cooperatives formed to bring power lines and generators to their communities. While such a centralized effort may be unlikely today without the urgency of the New Deal, The Rural Electrification Administration has demonstrated that The Rural Electrification Administration is time for the federal government to think more creatively and to act more swiftly to deploy broadband service. As service areas exist today, Geoff Wiggins cannot get broadband internet service extended to his house in Liberty Township, Ohio, near Columbus, even though he lives in either direction from available service. Geoff Wiggins said a local provider told Geoff Wiggins Geoff Wiggins’d have to pay more than $30,000 to get internet cable extended just to Geoff Wiggins driveway.</segment>

				<segment>So Geoff Wiggins has relied on wireless service from phone providers and weekend excursions to the parking lots of nearby businesses. Universal broadband will be costly, but shelter-in-place orders have demonstrated that it is even more costly to leave so many Americans behind. to accelerate deployment of the $20. 4 billion overseen by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a start, but the F. C.C. has estimated it could take to reach nearly every American without broadband. House Democrats that more than $80 billion be authorized over five years for broadband expansion. “People are afraid of the price tag,” said Mr. Clyburn, a co-sponsor of the bill along with Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. “We can’t afford not to do it. ” Perhaps more daunting is the challenge of providing service that is speedy and at a price that even lower-income Americans can afford. found that poorer Americans can afford only $10 a month for internet service. But such service is typically at far slower speeds than what is available in more affluent neighborhoods, or for free at Starbucks. Private industry may have little desire to provide lower-tier broadband service when it can profit far more from higher-end services. The expansion of federal programs, like E-Rate, to allow schools to distribute broadband service directly to students could also help lower costs. But those solutions are not a fix to the broader problem. Drawing Wi-Fi from school buses and fast-food restaurants isn’t a long-term solution. The Times is committed to publishing to the editor.

Black players make up less than 2 percent a work by a Black composer. The protests against police brutality and racial exclusion that have engulfed the country since the end of May have encouraged individuals and organizations toward new awareness of long-held biases, and provided new motivation to change. Nine Black performers spoke with The New York Times about steps that could be taken to begin transforming a white-dominated field. These are edited excerpts from the conversations. Monica Ellis in Harlem this month. Wayne Lawrence for The New York Times The first step is admitting that these organizations are built on a white framework built to benefit white people. Have you done the work to create a structure that is actually benefiting Black and brown communities? When that occurs, diversity is a natural byproduct. There needs to be intentional hiring of qualified Black musicians who you know are going to bring the goods to your audiences. Intentionally adding qualified Black board members to your organization: That’s going to allow access to these communities you need to bring into the circle. Administratively, people who are in the room will bring different perspectives. Chamber groups like mine, Imani Winds, have the ability to be more nimble; we can make our own rules and make our own platforms. As a chamber presenter, you can support groups that bring blackness and diversity in their programs.

It’s very evenly balanced as far as gender and race; those changes were implemented through consulting work and training, and facilitated discussions among the board of Chamber Music America to make sure everyone was on the same page. Going through that process has been eye-opening, and proves how much time it takes. Now we are equipped to have these discussions about how this can trickle down to membership and granting opportunities. And I think presenting organizations need to take the time to get to know the artists. Getting to know the artists takes the time to get to know the artists; it’s a commitment to widen your perspective. Roderick Cox in Berlin this month. Mustafah Abdulaziz for The New York Times I would like changes to be made in how we train musicians in conservatories and universities. A lot of our thinking, and our perceptions of what’s good music, becomes indoctrinated at that stage.

When our start with preconceived notions, our limit our. People are afraid of being uncomfortable, but with discomfort comes growth. If students learn about composers like William Grant Still or Florence Price — and their approaches to making music — then students will become more versatile.

I’m doing the Music Advancement Program at Juilliard; the mission revolves around students from underserved communities. It’s being a citizen in that way. The new way is actually getting on the ground and teaching, getting on the ground and having tough conversations about the state of our field and who we’re trying to reach. Being there to help people understand that the orchestra is there for them. Lawrence Brownlee performing at the Church of the Intercession in Manhattan in 2018. Artistic institutions need to be focused on representing and really serving the communities that they’re in. There needs to be community engagement, not community outreach. Outreach is something you do occasionally. But you’re always in the act of engaging; it’s a constant effort.

Well-intentioned people can just have blinders on. I don’t look at it like a sinister plot; I look at it as people are going with what they’re comfortable with. If we had more representation in the leadership, in terms of who is signing off on projects, you’ll have more people bringing things to the table. What I saw at Opera Theater of St. Louis — where I did “Champion” and “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” which is going to the Met — is those people are open to a lot of ideas. But we have to bring the ideas to those people. we have to open those people eyes. I really think in the art music world, people are clamoring for something different. When we did “Champion” in New Orleans, this African-American guy in his 70s said, “If this is opera, I will come. ” That’s a new audience member we didn’t have before. “La Bohème” doesn’t mean anything to him.

But with upheaval comes an opportunity, and the end of excuses, to truly reform opera’s culture — to place anti-racism front and center as the industry rebuilds itself. Opera companies can start by simply paying attention to what Black artists are saying in discussions like the one organized by Ms. Bridges, or in online talk shows such as Mr. Brownlee’s While the problems that have come up in these conversations are nothing new, they have new urgency at a time of racial unrest that many say just The panel was organized with Los Angeles Opera and featured, clockwise from top left: Julia Bullock, Karen Slack, Morris Robinson, Lawrence Brownlee, Russell Thomas and Ms. Bridges. Lawrence Brownlee, Russell Thomas and Ms. Bridges were among the artists who took part in her panel, which also included , the bass Morris Robinson and the tenor Russell Thomas. The stories Lawrence Brownlee, Russell Thomas and Ms. Bridges shared would amount to a human resources crisis in any workplace: Christopher Koelsch, Los Angeles Opera’s president and chief executive, said in an interview that his initial reaction to the video was “horror and sorrow that the lived experience of Lawrence Brownlee, Russell Thomas and Ms. Bridges went unheard in that raw way. ” Reflecting on police brutality and the while Christopher Koelsch, Los Angeles Opera’s president and chief executive was bird-watching in Central Park, Morris Robinson said in the discussion that Morris Robinson has always known that something similar could happen to Morris Robinson. “I walk around every opera rehearsal I’ve ever been to guarded,” Morris Robinson said, “cognizant of the fact that my interaction needs to be very public, in front of everyone, and very innocuous, such that all doubts, all potential images, are eradicated. ” Morris Robinson described casual indignities Morris Robinson has experienced throughout Morris Robinson career, such as the dissonance between the praise Morris Robinson receives onstage and the slights Morris Robinson encounters away from it: being told by an audience member that a light was out in the bathroom, or being asked by another where Morris Robinson parked the bus. Morris Robinson and Mr. Thomas, during a summer run of Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” in Cincinnati, attended a board leadership party where they felt forced to keep their cool in the face of brazen racism from a white donor.</segment>

E.O. of a company; I’ve never had a Black president of the board; I’ve never had a Black conductor,” Mr. Robinson said. “I don’t even have Black stage managers.

				<segment>The Met has presented 306 operas in its 137-year history, none of them by a Black composer. (That will change Last season opened with a production of “Porgy and Bess,” which despite having an almost exclusively Black cast — as required by the estate of its creators, the Gershwin brothers — was directed and conducted by white men (though choreographed by a Black woman, “Stop allowing white people to tell Black people about the Black experience,” he said. “That, to he, is outrageous. Don’t tell me about how I should feel to be Black and how I should move. ” Ms. Bullock, who early in the conversation said “I’m getting so tired of trying to make peace within he,” called for an anonymous survey to identify patterns of racial inequity in the field, including at conservatories. Ms. Bridges said in a later interview that, similar to sexual harassment workshops, companies should mandate racism and diversity training. Ms. Slack’s demand, Ms. Bridges said in the video, amounted to no more than “humanity”: “I’m not asking for your seat. I’m asking that you move over so I can sit in mine, and you be OK with that. ” Davóne Tines, left, and Ms. Slack in Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” at Opera Theater of St. Louis last year. The work will travel to the Met in a future season, and become that company’s first staged opera by a Black composer. There are signs that leaders in the opera world are listening, though that is only one step toward progress. “It’s very easy right now to be an ally,” Mr. Brownlee said in an interview. “But what I have charged people to do is be deliberate. I told my agent, I told general directors: Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is. ” Some Black musicians, like their counterparts in other fields, bristle at the idea of being a teacher to their white colleagues. It’s not Some Black musicians responsibility, but it is something that Ms. Bridges, an ambassador for the Coalition for African Americans in the Performing Arts , said she is passionate about, adding that during the past month she has been in conversation with numerous organizations that reached out to her.</segment>

The city’s Commission on Human Rights decided against the musicians, but found that aspects of the orchestra’s hiring system, especially regarding substitute and extra players, functioned as an old boys’ network and were discriminatory. The ruling helped prod American orchestras, finally, to try and deal with the biases that had kept them overwhelmingly white and male. The Philharmonic, and many other ensembles, began to hold auditions behind a screen, so that factors like race and gender wouldn’t influence strictly musical appraisals. , grew. Today, women make up a third of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and they are half the New York Philharmonic. Blind auditions changed the face of American orchestras. , especially in regard to Black and Latino artists. In a 2014 study, only 1. 8 percent of the players in top ensembles were Black; just 2. 5 percent were Latino. At the time of the Philharmonic’s 1969 discrimination case, it had one Black player, the first it ever hired: Sanford Allen, a violinist. Today, in a city that is a quarter Black, just one out of 106 full-time players is Black: Anthony McGill, the principal clarinet. Anthony McGill playing with the New York Philharmonic in February.

				<segment>If things are to change, ensembles must be able to take proactive steps to address the appalling racial imbalance that remains in their ranks. Blind auditions are no longer tenable. This well-intentioned but restrictive practice has prevented substantive action when it comes to the most essential element of maintaining an orchestra: hiring musicians. Musicians’ unions, which have in many ways valiantly worked to protect their members in an economically tenuous industry, have long been tenacious defenders of blind auditions, asserting that they are the best way to ensure fairness. But in sticking so stubbornly to the practice, unions may be hurting Musicians’ unions, which have in many ways valiantly worked to protect their members in an economically tenuous industry, Musicians’ unions, which have in many ways valiantly worked to protect their members in an economically tenuous industry orchestras and Musicians’ unions, which have in many ways valiantly worked to protect their members in an economically tenuous industry art form. Hanging on to a system that has impeded diversity is particularly conspicuous at a moment when the country has been galvanized by revulsion to police brutality against Black Americans — and when orchestras, largely shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic, are brainstorming both how to be more relevant to their communities and how to redress racial inequities among their personnel when they re-emerge. If the musicians onstage are going to better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve, the audition process has to be altered to take into fuller account artists’ backgrounds and experiences. Removing the screen is a crucial step. Blind auditions are based on an appealing premise of pure meritocracy: An orchestra should be built from the very best players, period. But ask anyone in the field, and you’ll learn that over the past century of increasingly professionalized training, there has come to be remarkably little difference between players at the top tier. There is an athletic component to playing an instrument, and as with sprinters, gymnasts and tennis pros, the basic level of technical skill among American instrumentalists has steadily risen. A typical orchestral audition might end up attracting dozens of people who are essentially indistinguishable in their musicianship and technique.</segment>

				<segment>It’s like an elite college facing a sea of applicants with straight A’s and perfect test scores. Such a school can move past those marks, embrace diversity as a social virtue and assemble a freshman class that advances other values along with academic achievement. For orchestras, the qualities of an ideal player might well include talent as an educator, interest in unusual repertoire or willingness to program innovative chamber events as well as pure musicianship. American orchestras should be able to foster these values, and a diverse complement of musicians, rather than passively waiting for representation to emerge from behind the audition screen. Some leaders in the field I’ve spoken with over the years have argued that the problem starts earlier than auditions. Some leaders in the field say racial diversity is missing in the so-called pipeline that leads from learning an instrument to summer programs to conservatories to graduate education to elite jobs. In this view, even that strong pool of equally talented hypothetical auditioners might have few, if any, Black or Latino players in it. , which is dedicated to encouraging diversity in classical music by fostering young artists, argues that the pipeline is not the problem, and that talented musicians of color are out there and ready. Afa S. Dworkin, the president of the Sphinx Organization (top left), participating in an online panel discussion among leading Black musicians. “As we speak,” she said in a recent online among leading Black musicians, “about 96 Black and brown students who were competitively selected from hundreds who auditioned for Sphinx’s summer programs are going to go through intensive solo and chamber music training. ” she added that any of those young artists would soon be worthy of entrance to an elite conservatory and, in just a few years, ready for top-tier auditions. Sphinx has been attempting to change the auditions landscape. Two years ago, alongside the , a trade group, Sphinx began a program to train musicians for auditions by pairing them with mentors, giving them performance opportunities and awarding them stipends to travel to auditions. (The heavy costs associated with auditions disproportionately affect younger musicians of color; if you can’t afford to buy many flights and hotel rooms each year, it doesn’t matter how well you play. ) But orchestras must be a part of changing the landscape, too, by getting rid of blind auditions. Change can be unnerving. Might the gains female players have made be reversed if the screen comes down? Might old habits of favoring the students of veteran players return? Orchestras will need to be transparent about their goals and procedures if they are to move forward with a new approach to auditions — one that takes race and gender into account, along with the full spectrum of a musician’s experience.</segment>

The new name of A novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, A novel coronavirus was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. respiratory droplets produced can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in .

Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19? the outbreak of COVID-19 is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website. ​ Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19? At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19. Does CDC recommend the use of facemask or face coverings to prevent COVID-19? Wear cloth face coverings in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear cloth face coverings in public settings.</segment>

Contacts should monitor themselves by checking their temperature twice daily and watching for Public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time when they may have been infectious. Public health staff begin contact tracing by notifying exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, not revealing the infected patient’s identity. Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to help them understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, and how to monitor themselves for illness. In addition, Contacts are informed of the possibility that Contacts could spread the infection to others even if Contacts do not feel ill.

If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance. my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 to the United States? CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.</segment>

Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been present? The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical. After cleaning and disinfection, the CDC recommendations for that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming: Consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is less that needs to be vacuumed. Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility. What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19? Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment.</segment>

For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface. Is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes COVID-19? Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Who should clean and disinfect community spaces? Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used. How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work? Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i. e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the closed off area has been , the closed off area can be opened for use.

Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19? Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e. g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e. g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19? CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that CDC are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19? CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces. Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?

Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19? We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until We learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.

CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for this virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with this virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with this virus as cats and ferrets.</segment>

Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States: Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young. Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat. Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead. Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread COVID-19 back to people? Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19.

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing Covering mouth and nose with a Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily Closing businesses and schools and limiting other services Who is involved in community mitigation actions? Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including , and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. Putting mitigation into practice is based on Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.

Clinicians can access laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized or intended to be authorized by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform Clinicians diagnostic services to see how best to access SARS-CoV-2 testing. Clinicians also can access viral testing through Clinicians provides a list of available public health laboratory testing locations. COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices Under what circumstances should laboratories use either a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA? FDA has authorized EUAs for a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed. Important Information on the Use of Serological (Antibody) Tests for COVID-19: FDA Letter to Healthcare Providers Where do laboratories get access to reagents and materials to perform viral testing for SARS-CoV-2?

CDC’s new , which detects influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, received an EUA from FDA on July 2, 2020, and will be distributed through The IRR when production is complete. The IRR also provides several additional commercially produced assays that have received an an EUA from FDA to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in respiratory samples. Clinical and commercial laboratories conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing can acquire test reagents from commercial reagent manufacturers that have received an EUA from FDA. Commercial labs can get reagents for CDC’s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR from qualified sources listed in the . A list of commercially available reagents for use with the multiplex assay is not available at this time. However, CDC plans to share the primers and probe sequences publicly, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents. Genomic RNA material for validation purposes can be obtained from BEI Resources as indicated below (in Test Developers FAQs). Can laboratories use specimen collection devices other than those listed in the manufacturer’s instructions or EUA (e. g., swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 testing? According to FDA, when one entity establishes equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components (including viral transport media [VTM]), and FDA’s review of the validation data indicates that FDA could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, FDA will post this information on FDA website so that other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing. Then, other laboratories do not need to conduct their own bridging study for the same modification. For additional information regarding FDA’s policy for modification, see Where can I find additional CDC guidance about laboratory testing? CDC has published the following interim guidelines and updates CDC regularly: Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with COVID-19 I can&apos;t find swabs or media for SARS-CoV-2 testing. What are my options? The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is directly managing allocation of swabs and media, including viral transport medium (VTM), based on state and territory testing plans that were submitted in response to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act requirements. Allocations were predetermined to maximize state and territory testing using a data-driven algorithm based on population, high incidence areas, and COVID-19 Task Force’s directives. Currently, The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is distributing the following swabs: nasopharyngeal (NP), nasal, foam, and poly swabs. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is distributing Saline. For specific swab or medium requests, delivery site changes, or other related requests contact Public health and clinical laboratories can also produce their own VTM if it is unavailable for purchase.</segment>

Saline is also an acceptable transport medium for some COVID-19 viral assays, including the to see which transport medium is acceptable. My facility would like to begin SARS-CoV-2 testing. Do we need a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate? Can My facility be granted a waiver from the CLIA certification requirements so that I can begin testing immediately? Before conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, a laboratory must be CLIA-certified and meet applicable regulatory requirements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have the authority to grant waivers of exceptions that are not established in a statute or regulation. For additional information, please refer to the  FAQs on the CMS website: What is the CLIA test complexity categorization of SARS-CoV-2 tests that do not have an EUA? Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA have not been reviewed by FDA, are not FDA-authorized, and have not received a . Thus, Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA are considered high complexity by default until Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA receive an EUA or other FDA review that indicates Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA may be performed as moderate complexity or waived tests. For more information, visit , and navigate to the section titled “General FAQs. ” When FDA authorizes emergency use for a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test, can that test be used in CLIA certificate-of-waiver facilities? When FDA grants an EUA for a point-of-care test, a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is deemed to be CLIA-waived. For the duration of the national emergency declaration for COVID-19, such tests can be performed in any CLIA-certified patient care setting with a certificate of waiver. How do I apply for a CLIA certificate so that my testing facility can perform SARS-CoV-2 testing? The federal CLIA program contracts with states to carry out certain oversight and recording functions of the CLIA program. The state in which the laboratory is located processes applications for CLIA certificates. After the laboratory has identified a qualified and certified and has provided all required information on the CMS-116 application, a CLIA number will be assigned and the laboratory can begin testing if applicable CLIA requirements have been met.</segment>

				<segment>My facility created a laboratory-developed test (LDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2. We need to have the first five positive and negative specimens confirmed. Can We send the first five positive and negative specimens to CDC? Laboratories using an LDT to detect SARS-CoV-2 should confer with their state public health laboratory for assistance. If the state public health laboratory cannot assist, contact Does CDC accept specimens for antibody testing? CDC is currently performing antibody surveys to understand how COVID-19 has spread in the U. S. population. CDC is not using CDC antibody tests for diagnostic purposes, and thus is not accepting antibody test requests intended for COVID-19 patient diagnosis. Will CDC submit CDC antibody test for an EUA? Not at this time. CDC is using CDC antibody test as part of a multi-agency study to evaluate current commercially marketed antibody tests for specificity and sensitivity and to help determine how results from antibody tests could support policymaking. CDC will share information publicly on the recommended use of antibody testing as soon as enough data becomes available. Currently, there is no identified performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine which assay you choose to use. Using an assay that tests for IgM antibodies might be able to detect a more recent infection with SARS-CoV-2, but we do not yet have enough data to confirm this. We need additional data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 before we can make evidence-based recommendations about these different assays. Scientists from CDC and elsewhere are investigating how SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses develop over time. How should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks? All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols.</segment>

At this time, this recommendation only applies to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 respiratory specimens. Examples of respiratory specimens include nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swabs, tracheal and lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens, and sputum. Based on currently available data, other types of specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, such as blood, urine, and feces specimens, are still acceptable to transport through pneumatic tubes. Facilities should ensure that all personnel who transport specimens via pneumatic tubes are trained in safe handling practices, specimen management, and spill decontamination procedures. Each facility should also evaluate its risks and determine the most appropriate biosafety measures and practices to implement.

Recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing, are likely affecting data reported from both networks, making it difficult to draw conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give additional insight into illness related to COVID-19. Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates since March 1, 2020, are updated weekly. The overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 113. 6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (321. 8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (171. 8 per 100,000). From June 20 – July 4, there was a two week consecutive increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates, the first multiple-week increase seen since early April. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 8. 1% during week 27 to 6. 4% during week 28, representing the twelfth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely change as more death certificates are processed, particularly for recent weeks. All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. A description of the surveillance systems summarized in COVIDView, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component, There are increases in the percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and percentage of visits for ILI and/or CLI in multiple parts of the country. Three HHS regions (Regions 4 [South East], 6 [South Central] and 9 [South West/Coast]) are reporting percentage of visits for CLI and/or percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at higher levels than were seen in March/April.

The highest percentages of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were seen in Regions 4 (South East, 14. 0%), 6 (South Central, 17. 1%) and 9 (South West/Coast, 11. 2%). Increases were reported in four of ten HHS surveillance regions: Regions 2 (NY/NJ/Puerto Rico), 5 (Midwest), 7 (Central) and 8 (Mountain). Six HHS regions (Regions 1 [New England], 3 [Mid-Atlantic], 4 [South East], 6 [South Central], 9 [South West/Coast] and 10 [Pacific Northwest]) reported a stable or decreasing percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during week 28 compared to week 27. However, the percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Regions 4 (South East) and 6 (South Central) were higher during week 28 than week 26. Week 27 included a holiday that could have affected both testing and reporting practices during week 27. The percentage of outpatient and emergency department visits for ILI are below baseline nationally and in all regions of the country; however, increases in the percentage of visits for ILI and/or CLI were reported in seven of ten HHS surveillance regions when compared to week 27 and in nine surveillance regions when compared to week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. Systems monitoring ILI and CLI may be influenced by recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 113. 6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people 65 years of age and older (321. 8 per 100,000) followed by people 50-64 years (171. 8 per 100,000). Hospitalization rates are cumulative and will increase as the pandemic continues. From week 25 – week 27 (June 20 – July 4), there was a two consecutive week increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates. This is the first time since early April that an increase in weekly hospitalization rates has been observed over a multiple-week period.</segment>

Overall cumulative hospitalization rates for COVID-19 at this time are higher than cumulative end-of-season hospitalization rates for influenza over each of the past 5 influenza seasons. However, for children (0-17 years), cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are much lower than cumulative influenza hospitalization rates during recent influenza seasons. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 8. 1% during week 27 to 6. 4% during week 28, representing the twelfth consecutive week during which a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC has been recorded. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely change as additional death certificates for deaths during recent weeks are processed. The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are summarized below. The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are performing primary diagnostic functions; therefore, the percentage of specimens testing positive across laboratory types can be used to monitor overall trends in COVID-19 activity. As the outbreak progresses, it is possible that different types of laboratories will take on different roles, and the data interpretation may need to change. Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC* * Commercial and clinical laboratory data represent select laboratories and do not capture all tests performed in the United States. * Commercial laboratories began testing for SARS-CoV-2 in early March, but the number and geographic distribution of reporting commercial laboratories became stable enough to calculate a weekly percentage of specimens testing positive as of March 29, 2020. Two syndromic surveillance systems are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors a slightly different syndrome, and together Two syndromic surveillance systems provide a more comprehensive picture of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness than either would individually. Two syndromic surveillance systems are currently being affected by recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so.

				<segment>Nationwide during week 28, 1. 4% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is well below the national baseline of 2. 4% but is increasing, which is atypical for this time of year compared to previous influenza seasons. The pattern of increasing percentage of visits for ILI was reported for 0-4 year olds and persons 25 years of age and older. * Age-group specific percentages should not be compared to the national baseline. , the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0. 5% to 2. 3% during week 28. All ten regions are below their region-specific baselines; however, compared to week 27, the percentage of visits for ILI during week 28 increased in seven of the ten regions (Regions 2 [NY/NJ/PR], 3 [Mid-Atlantic], 4 [South East], 5 [Midwest], 7 [Central], 8 [Mountain], and 9 [South/West Coast] and remained stable in two regions (Regions 1 [New England] and 10 [Pacific Northwest]). In Regions 6 (South Central) and 10 [Pacific Northwest), the percentage of visits for ILI reported during week 28 was less than or the same as the percentage reported during week 27 but greater than the percentage reported for week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as we move into summer weeks when lower levels of influenza and other respiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While all regions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlighted here. Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and New York City. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared to the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at or above the mean.

In comparison to week 27, this week there was a slight decrease in the percentage of visits for CLI and ILI remained steady. However, both CLI and ILI percentages during week 28 were higher than they were in week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27.

Additional information about medically attended outpatient and emergency department visits for ILI and CLI: The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in select counties participating in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). A total of 37,052 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were reported by sites between March 1, 2020 and July 11, 2020. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 113. 6 per 100,000 population. Among the 0-4 years, 5-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years, and  65 years age groups, the highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged  65, followed by adults aged 50-64 years and adults aged 18-49 years. From June 20 (MMWR week 25) – July 4 (MMWR week 27), there was a two consecutive week increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates. This is the first time since early April that an increase in weekly hospitalization rates has been observed over a multiple-week period. Data for week ending July 11 (MMWR week 28) currently show a decline; however, those data are likely to change as more data for admissions occurring during that week are received. Among the 37,052 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalized cases, 34,669 (93. 6%) had information on race and ethnicity while collection of race and ethnicity was still pending for 2,383 (6. 4%) cases. When examining overall age-adjusted rates by race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5. 6 times that of non-Hispanic White persons. Rates for non-Hispanic Black persons and Hispanic or Latino persons were approximately 4. 6 times the rate among non-Hispanic White persons.

				<segment>by age and race and ethnicity — COVID-NET, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates by race/ethnicity are calculated using hospitalized COVID-NET cases with known race and ethnicity for the numerator and For each age category, rate ratios are the ratios between crude hospitalization rates within each racial/ethnic group and the crude hospitalization rate among non-Hispanic white persons in the same age category. Overall rates are adjusted to account for differences in age distributions within race/ethnicity strata in the COVID-NET catchment area; the age strata used for the adjustment include 0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ years. Non-Hispanic White persons and non-Hispanic Black persons represent the highest proportions of hospitalized cases reported to COVID-NET, followed by Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons. However, some racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented among hospitalized cases as compared with the overall population of the catchment area. Prevalence ratios show a similar pattern to that of the age-adjusted hospitalization rates: non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have the highest prevalence ratio, followed by non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic or Latino persons. Persons of multiple races (0. 2%) or unknown race and ethnicity (6. 1%) are not represented in the table but are included as part of the denominator. Prevalence ratio is calculated as the ratio of the proportion of hospitalized COVID-NET cases over the proportion of population in COVID-NET catchment area. Among 9,736 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 90. 9% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were hypertension, obesity, chronic metabolic disease and cardiovascular disease. Among 199 hospitalized children with information on underlying conditions, 51. 3% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were obesity, asthma and neurologic conditions.

For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors. ”  Examples include CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations. CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners. People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection. It is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you: Take precautions as you go about your Better understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19. Anticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick. Reduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors. How We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. that have been identified to date include: Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person’s risk. CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below. These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.

For surveillance of COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems in collaboration with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to monitor COVID-19 in the United States. COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources using existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, lab reporting, the healthcare safety system, ongoing research platforms, and other new surveillance systems designed to answer specific questions. The data from these systems, combined, create an updated picture of COVID-19’s spread and its effects in the United States and are used to inform the U. S. national public health response to COVID-19. To understand disease severity and the spectrum of illness due to COVID-19 To understand risk factors for severe disease and transmission of COVID-19 To monitor for changes in the virus that causes COVID-19 To estimate disease burden due to COVID-19 To understand how COVID-19 impacts the capacity of the U. S. healthcare system (for example, availability and shortages of key resources) COVID-19 data can be used to help public health professionals, policy makers, and health care providers monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and support better understanding of illness, disease severity, effectiveness of community interventions, and social disruptions associated with COVID-19 in the U. S.. These data help inform U. S. national, state, local, tribal, and territorial public health responses to COVID-19. Detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts. Where can I find information on COVID-19 cases, testing, hospitalizations, deaths, and other surveillance in the United States? CDC provides this information on the Cases reported in the U. S. so far (and new cases reported in the past day) Deaths reported in the U. S. so far (and new deaths reported in the past day) Reported deaths by county in the U. S. so far (and new deaths reported in the past day) U. S.

S. Estimated percentage of inpatient beds occupied by all patients, by state Estimated percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, by state Estimated percentage of ICU beds occupied by all patients, by state . This change was made to reflect an interim statement issued by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19; with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19. Why are we seeing a rise in cases? The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases reflects the rapid community spread of COVID-19 in many U. S. states, territories and means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Also, the being reported in the United States is rising due to Why are the death counts for the Cases in the U. S. webpage different from the Provisional Death Counts for COVID-19 webpage? The COVID-19 death count shown on the web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments. The COVID-19 death count shown on the web page reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting from health departments. from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday through Friday with information collected from death certificates. information collected from death certificates represent the most accurate death counts.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, there is on average a delay of 1–2 weeks before they are reported. Therefore, the Provisional Death Counts may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods. Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received. Provisional COVID-19 death counts may therefore differ from those on other published sources, such as media reports or the What does the mortality rate mean? Why does this percentage keep changing? the mortality rate is the percentage of people who died due to COVID-19 out of the total number of people with COVID-19 reported. Since this is an ongoing outbreak, the percentage can change daily. There are several reasons for this, such as there may be delays in reporting of additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and not all COVID-19 cases will be detected. Why do some case numbers reported by state health departments, Johns Hopkins, and the World Health Organization (WHO) sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website? CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ. Case numbers reported on other websites may differ from what is posted on CDC’s website because CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with each jurisdiction. Differences between reporting jurisdictions and CDC’s website may occur due to the timing of reporting and website updates. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by other sites may differ. Does CDC create surveillance reports on COVID-19? Yes. CDC is modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19.

Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick. If you are thinking about traveling away from your local community, ask: Will you or those you are traveling with be within 6 feet of others during or after your trip?

We don’t know if one type of travel is safer than others; however, airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to (keep 6 feet apart from other people). Consider the following risks for getting or spreading COVID-19, depending on how you travel: Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others. Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and surfaces. You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel typically means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others.</segment>

Timely communication between clinical and laboratory staff is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling specimens from patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such specimens should be labeled accordingly, and laboratory should be alerted to ensure proper specimen handling. General and specific biosafety guidelines for handling SARS-CoV-2 specimens are provided below. For additional information on handling SARS-CoV-2 specimens, refer to the All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on: Identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures The competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures Follow Standard Precautions when handling clinical specimens, all of which may contain potentially infectious materials. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. Follow routine laboratory practices and procedures for decontamination of work surfaces and management of laboratory waste. Staining and microscopic analysis of fixed smears Molecular analysis of extracted nucleic acid preparations Final packaging of specimens for transport to diagnostic laboratories for additional testing (specimens should already be in a sealed, decontaminated primary container) Using inactivated specimens, such as specimens in nucleic acid extraction buffer The practice of anatomic pathology plays a critical role in determining accurate disease diagnoses by studying organ tissues and fluids. Anatomic pathology includes Risks associated with surgical pathology and some cytology procedures occur during the manipulation of fresh tissue and body fluids from patients who may have an unknown or known infectious disease, such as COVID-19. Risks are increased in the surgical grossing room during manual specimen handling, tissue dissection, and the preparation of frozen sections of tissue using a cryostat. These procedures can result in percutaneous exposures from punctures or cuts; droplet or aerosol exposures from splashes of blood and body fluids; and exposures from surfaces contaminated with the virus. Clinical as well as non-clinical support staff need to be aware of these risks and provided with effective mitigation procedures. See Collection and Submission of Postmortem Specimens from Deceased Persons with Known or Suspected COVID-19 apply to clinical pathology, which involves laboratory testing on patient specimens, such as blood, body fluids, stool and urine. Clinical pathology uses different procedures and workflows than those used in anatomic pathology, and therefore the risks and mitigation controls needed to protect personnel are different. At a minimum, all personnel—whether practicing anatomic or clinical pathology—should follow when handling patient tissues and specimens.</segment>

				<segment>Point-of-Care (POC) tests are intended to supplement laboratory testing, making testing available to communities and populations that cannot readily access laboratory testing, and bolstering testing to quickly address emerging outbreaks. Examples of potential uses for POC instruments for COVID-19 diagnostic purposes include: Deployment to rural hospitals or other critical care sites that lack widely available testing. Use at public health department testing sites that perform CLIA-waived testing for other purposes. Deployment to long-term care facilities or correctional institutions. Rapid deployment to aid in the investigation of a newly identified case cluster. Placement in laboratories to test high-priority specimens that require a rapid result. Regulatory requirements and necessary CLIA documentation need to be considered when deploying instruments to these settings if they are not currently performing other POC testing. Testing sites that operate a POC diagnostic instrument must have a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certificate. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will permit a laboratory to extend its existing Certificate of Waiver to operate a temporary COVID-19 testing site in an off-site location, such as a long-term care facility. a temporary COVID-19 testing site is only permitted to perform waived tests, consistent with the laboratory’s existing certificate, and must be under the direction of the existing lab director. Laboratories should consider the following when using POC instruments for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic purpose: Use the instrument in a location associated with a current CLIA certificate. Perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate safety risks. Train staff on the proper use of the instrument and ways to minimize the risk of exposures. Follow Standard Precautions when handling clinical specimens, including hand hygiene and the use of PPE, such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. If needed, additional precautions can be used, such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, such as a splash shield to work behind. When using patient swabs, minimize contamination of the swab stick and wrapper by widely opening the wrapper prior to placing the swab back into the wrapper. Change gloves after adding patient specimens to the instrument. Decontaminate the instrument after each run by using an EPA-approved disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2.

Examples of these additional precautions include personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, like a splash shield; centrifuge safety cups; and sealed centrifuge rotors to reduce the risk of exposure to laboratory personnel. Site- and activity-specific biosafety risk assessments should be performed to determine if additional biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. Procedures that concentrate viruses, such as precipitation or membrane filtration, can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow and BSL-3 precautions, including respiratory protection and a designated area for donning and doffing PPE. The donning and doffing space should not be in the workspace. Work should be performed in a certified Class II BSC. This guidance is intended for only those laboratories that perform virus concentration procedures, including wastewater/sewage surveillance testing, and not for public health or clinical diagnostic laboratories that handle COVID-19 clinical specimens or laboratories that perform culture and isolation of SARS-CoV-2. Site- and activity-specific biosafety risk assessments should be performed to determine if additional biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes or large volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. CDC recommends virus isolation in cell culture, and initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of novel SARS-CoV-2 should be conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory using BSL-3 practices. To determine appropriate biosafety mitigation measures, laboratories should perform an activity-specific biosafety risk assessment that evaluates laboratory facilities, personnel and training, practices and techniques, safety equipment, and risk mitigation measures. Biosafety professionals, laboratory management, and scientific and safety experts should be involved in the risk assessment process.

				<segment>The new guidance requires facilities and ordering providers to gather more complete patient demographic information to send to state and local public health departments. State and local health departments will then forward the deidentified data to CDC. 1. Does The new guidance require the reporting of all laboratory tests, including antibody tests and negative test results, at the case level? Yes, the CARES Act and the implementing guidance require all clinical laboratories and testing providers that perform diagnostic testing under a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate to report the results of any test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19 not just positive tests, to state or local public health departments. Laboratories that conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 must not report their results as diagnostic results to state or local public health departments. 2. Will facilities or healthcare providers that order COVID-19 tests be required to collect the “ask on order entry” (AOE) questions? Yes, this information is critical for state and local public health departments to plan and execute COVID-19 control and mitigation efforts. These elements must be collected and be conformant with the 3. Should AOE questions be sent to the health department in the electronic laboratory report messages? Yes, all data fields are expected to be collected and reported to state and local public health departments in the electronic laboratory report messages. 4. Will CDC accept COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) extracts if they do not include all required data elements? Yes, CDC will still accept the data. CDC recognizes that in many cases, this information is not provided in testing orders. The new HHS guidance aims to increase the reporting of important data elements, such as race and ethnicity. The new HHS guidance states that “any person or entity ordering a diagnostic or serologic test, collecting a specimen, or performing a test should make every reasonable effort to collect complete demographic information and should include such data when ordering a laboratory test to enable the entities performing the test to report these data to state and local public health departments.</segment>

				<segment>How will the data reported to state and jurisdictional health departments be used? Laboratory data reported to state and jurisdictional health departments will be used to help track the spread of COVID-19 and identify areas that are highly impacted by the infection. Laboratory data will also be used to track when the spread of infection appears to be slowing down by location. On a national level, the deidentified data shared with CDC will contribute to understanding national disease incidence and prevalence, positivity trends, and testing coverage, and will help identify supply chain issues for reagents and other materials. 7. For a clinical research trial approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), are laboratories required to report laboratory testing data from CLIA-certified COVID-19 testing (nucleic acid, antigen, or antibody) if the specimens are de-identified and results are not returned to the ordering clinician? In general, no. Laboratories are not responsible for reporting these data. However, state health department rules and regulations apply and may differ from The new HHS guidance. 8. For an IRB-approved clinical research trial, what are the requirements for reporting laboratory testing data from CLIA-certified COVID-19 testing (nucleic acid, antigen, or antibody) if the specimens are de-identified and results are being returned to the ordering clinician for patient care? the requirements for reporting laboratory testing data from CLIA-certified COVID-19 testing (nucleic acid, antigen, or antibody differ for laboratories and research clinicians: Laboratories are not responsible for reporting these data since laboratories do not have the patient-identifying information required for compliance with reporting requirements. However, state health department rules and regulations apply and may differ from The new HHS guidance. In clinical trials, research clinicians who are responsible for clinical care of trial participants are responsible for linking de-identified specimen test results to participant demographic information and are required to report the positive results daily to their state or local health department. Demographic information required for reporting is detailed in HHS’s Research clinicians are not required to report negative test results. However, state health department rules and regulations apply and may differ from The new HHS guidance.</segment>

				<segment>If a clinician receives COVID-19 test results from duplicate specimens that were collected in the same manner and tested with different test methods (e. g., different platforms) or in different CLIA laboratories, the clinician should not report both results. In the case of two positive test results, a clinician should report the result that is provided first. In the case of discrepant test results, a clinician should report the positive result. However, state health department rules and regulations apply and may differ from The new HHS guidance. If the clinician requests COVID-19 testing for study participants independent of research activities or for clinical management, results should be reported to the appropriate state or local public health department.

How can a crew, module, or resource “isolate as a unit” to better protect themselves? The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. All firefighters and support personnel should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. During the fire season, it will be important that members of each fire crew or module make an effort to operate and isolate as a unit. Management will need to develop and implement procedures and protocols to prevent possible exposures to the disease.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>When possible, crews should not interchange personnel or equipment between units and should limit the number of personnel who must interact with people in the community (e. g. fueling vehicles, picking up supplies, etc. ). This will require planning and using technology to safely accomplish tasks while maintaining social distancing as much as possible. This may include implementing procedures that allow fire crews or incident management personnel to stay remote, isolate from other units, or complete tasks or missions virtually. If close contact with others in the community is necessary, it is advised that all personnel wear facemasks or Wildfire management and personnel should prioritize reducing fatigue and remaining healthy throughout the fire season. Rest and proper hydration and nutrition should be prioritized and emphasized every workday. In many situations, fire personnel travel from many different geographic locations and live and work closely in shared living spaces, such as bunkhouses, during the fire season. In many situations, fire personnel travel from many different geographic locations and live and work closely in shared living spaces, such as bunkhouses, during the fire season, how do you prevent infection and spread of COVID-19 for co-workers or crewmates? When personnel arrive to their duty stations, it is recommended that management provide separate spaces for the personnel to themselves from others on their crew for 14 days, if possible. During this period, personnel should take special precautions to limit any close interactions with other people (maintaining at least 6-feet distance) and avoid sharing kitchens, living spaces (bedrooms), bathrooms, or household items. If shared living spaces and common areas must be utilized during the initial 14 day period after reporting, all personnel should still practice social distancing (maintaining at least 6 feet distance from one another), wear shared and high touch surfaces. Personnel should also consider sleeping in opposite directions (head to toe) and avoid using bunk beds in shared sleeping quarters. Management should also consider increasing ventilation rates and/or the percentage of outdoor air that circulates within the shared living and working areas. When feasible, management should employ mechanisms to support their employees and limit employees’ interactions with others during this period. This may include online ordered and delivered groceries, delivered meals, and virtual and online training tasks. After this period is over, fire crews and modules who work together and do not have regular interactions with other people can isolate as a unit. During this time, personnel should continue to cover their mouth and nose with tissue or elbow when they cough or sneeze, perform proper that are appropriate for the surface and effective against SARS-CoV-2, following label instructions. If a crew operates as a unit, it is not necessary for crew members to wear face coverings unless they are ). If interactions with the general public must occur, all personnel should practice social distancing, wear cloth face coverings, perform hand hygiene, and disinfect surfaces, objects, or items that are shared with the general public.</segment>

Wildfire agencies should consider implementing daily temperature checks and symptom screening, consistent with the White House guideline for . Consider a program for screening workers before entry into the workplace or fire incident, based on CDC guidance for screening employees for COVID-19 Verbal screening (from a distance of at least 6 feet) to determine if workers have had symptoms of COVID-19 within the past 24 hours. Checking temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100. 4℉ or greater. Ensure that screeners are trained to use temperature monitors. Make sure that temperature monitors are accurate under conditions of use (such as cold or hot temperatures). Avoid direct sunlight when recording temperatures. Preventing employees from entering the workplace if they have a fever of 100. 4℉ or greater, or if verbal screening results indicate that the worker may have COVID-19. Encourage workers to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider. Provide information on the agency’s return-to-work policies and procedures which may be informed by CDC’s Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings Inform the employer health unit (if in place), incident medical unit, and supervisor so the worker can return home and self-isolate. Ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers. Implement engineering controls, such as physical barriers or dividers or rope and stanchion systems, to maintain at least six feet between screeners and workers being screened. If screeners need to be within six feet of workers, provide them with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the tasks being performed. for workers performing screening duties and for workers managing a sick employee who has symptoms of COVID-19 in the work environment (see below). If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard ( Are first responders, like wildland firefighters, being prioritized for those who will be tested for COVID-19? , wildland firefighters who have COVID-19 symptoms should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation and potential testing.</segment>

				<segment>To continue working, the exposed worker should be symptom-free, and the employer should use the following prevention strategies: Regularly monitor the exposed worker for symptoms, under the supervision of a qualified healthcare provider. Ensure the exposed worker practices social distancing during his/her work shift by assigning tasks where he/she can still work but remain at least 6 feet away from others, if possible. Ensure the exposed worker wears a facemask (or cloth face covering only if facemasks are unavailable) to protect others. If an exposed worker develops symptoms of COVID-19and is still working, the employer should: Provide a facemask for the worker to wear (if not already wearing one). Send an exposed worker to the medical unit, if available, for evaluation to determine if medical care is needed. If a medical unit is not available, encourage an exposed worker to call a qualified medical provider for guidance. Send an exposed worker home if an exposed worker is safe for an exposed worker to travel and make sure an exposed worker is wearing a facemask. If it is not safe for an exposed worker to travel, isolate an exposed worker from others on the crew and require an exposed worker to wear a facemask. Ensure an exposed worker is provided with necessary supplies, including food, water, and hygiene items, while an exposed worker/she is self-isolating. Encourage an exposed worker to follow CDC guidance for What to Do If You Are Sick Clean and disinfect any surfaces and areas an exposed worker may have touched. Follow CDC guidance to determine when an exposed worker can What precautions should be implemented for protecting firefighters and other personnel at fire camps? Fire camps can include thousands of personnel living together and working collectively to respond to a wildfire, often in remote areas. In many ways, fire camps are like small communities. For example, fire camps employ a number of support personnel, some of whom may be considered at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e. g., older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions). Also, fire camps have many people coming and going throughout the day. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken. CDC’s COVID-19 Guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing The following are protective measures that can be employed within the fire camp to prevent COVID-19 transmission: Screening of temperature and symptoms for everyone entering a fire camp and daily screening for those who remain at the camp Encouraging personnel to maintain social distancing (6 feet or more) as much as feasible Providing hand washing stations (soap and water) or hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol throughout the camp, especially outside bathrooms, portable toilets, and dining facilities Providing individual bottles of hand sanitizer for all personnel at the fire camp Ensuring bathrooms, portable toilets, and handwash stations are well stocked with hygiene products (e. g., soap and water, hand sanitizer, paper towels) disinfectants approved by the EPA for use against COVID-19 to clean showers, bathrooms, sinks, portable toilets, and handwash stations at least twice a day (in the morning and evening after heavy use) and commonly-touched surfaces in the dining facility before and after each meal. Make sure individuals doing the cleaning are trained on the proper application of the disinfectant and wear protective disposable gloves and other PPE as recommended by the disinfectant manufacturer Instructing personnel to avoid placing toothbrushes (or other personal items) directly on sinks as that is a potential contamination pathway. Individual totes may be used to carry and keep personal items off sinks Ensuring that food service personnel wear disposable gloves during preparation and serving of food and practice recommended hand hygiene Staffing drink stations to limit the number of people touching the drink machines Instructing personnel not to share personal items (e. g., cups, canteens, safety glasses, etc. ) with others Using ventilation systems, fans, or open windows to increase outdoor air circulation in enclosed spaces within the fire camp including command tents, dining facilities, and showers Establishing housing in one area of the fire camp (or nearby community) that could be used for isolation, if necessary, and assigning someone on staff to make sure that anyone being isolated is provided with necessities.</segment>

Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of air pollutants that are harmful to humans. The relationship between wildfire smoke and COVID-19 has not yet been studied, but research suggests that exposure to smoke could increase the risk and severity of respiratory infections similar to COVID-19. Exposure to air pollutants in wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, alter immune function, and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections, possibly including COVID-19. In addition to potentially making firefighters more vulnerable to getting COVID-19, inflammation in the respiratory tract due to wildfire smoke might also increase the risk of developing more severe outcomes for those with COVID-19. Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and smoke exposure overlap. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath and difficulty breathing are symptoms of COVID-19 and smoke exposure. If a worker is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, they should contact a healthcare provider and follow CDC guidance on What To Do If You Are Sick Firefighters should consider and select tactics that safely reduce their exposure to smoke while meeting operational objectives. COVID-19 is an additional risk to consider when assessing all risks and hazards in the wildfire environment. Firefighters cannot completely eliminate their risk for exposure to smoke and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they can reduce this risk.

				<segment> Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, accused his Dutch counterpart of using the same methods as his country’s former communist leaders on Sunday, as EU leaders publicly clashed during tense and acrimonious negotiations over the terms of a proposed €1. 8tn budget and recovery package for the bloc. A third difficult day of a summit of EU 27 heads of state and government – the first in person for five months – saw movement towards agreement as talks stretched deep into the night, but laid bare the deep splits between north and south, and east and west. At a late evening dinner, the European council president, Charles Michel, who is chairing the summit, asked EU leaders whether EU leaders were “capable of building European unity and trust. Or, through a tear, will we present the face of a weak said on Monday EU leaders were making progress but warned discussions could still fall apart. “At times it didn’t look good last night, but I feel that on the whole we are making progress,” Rutte told reporters in Brussels. the summit will reconvene at 4pm central European time on Monday. What are EU leaders arguing about? At stake is a €750bn coronavirus recovery plan intended to pull EU out of a historic recession, as well as a €1. 074tn seven-year budget. One big row is how far countries should be able to access grants. France and , backed by the European commission, proposed €500bn in grants (the rest in loans) targeted at countries hardest hit by coronavirus. That has been whittled down to €390bn in a compromise plan, but whether it will be accepted remains unclear. think the unprecedented crisis requires serious financial firepower, backed by Italy and Spain, who see Covid-19 as a test case for European solidarity. A group of northern states - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden,  styled the “frugal four” - are wary of fiscal transfers.</segment>

				<segment>Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte takes the most hardline position, as he also wants his government to be able to veto recovery funds if a recipient is deemed failing on economic reforms. Adding to the complexity is an argument  over tying EU funds to respect for democratic values. Hungary and , currently subject to EU inquiries on the rule of law, want a veto on any attempt to remove funds from a rogue government. France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, who fear the weakening of democratic checks and balances, say there must be a link. Now some diplomats fear the issue could become hostage to a recovery plan deal. The leaders have been in intense debates over the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and EU’s seven-year budget, known as the multi-financial framework, which is due to start next year. Bitter coronavirus summit exposes trust deficit among EU leaders There are also stark differences over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer. The money will be borrowed from the capital markets by the European commission. Rutte has insisted he cannot be expected to take on extra national debt in order for EU to make cash payments to member states without his parliament having a say. In response, Orbán, the nationalist prime minister of Hungary, who was an anti-communist dissident in his youth, accused Rutte of aping Soviet methods to crush dissent by failing to properly set out the terms on which funds would be blocked. is seeking reassurance that commonly issued debt will be properly spent and wants the ability to hold back disbursements where there are governance concerns. “They would like to introduce a new mechanism that didn’t exist until now,” Orbán told reporters, of the Dutch proposal for a country to be able to stop funding to member states undermining the rule of law. “I think it is questionable whether it has a basis in the treaty at all. I am coming from an ex-communist country. When the communist regime decided to attack us, they use unclarified legal terms exactly as the same as written in the proposal of the Dutch man … Saying ‘general deficiencies’.</segment>

				<segment>” The row over the rule of law was dwarfed, however, by a more significant dispute over the size and form of the recovery fund, with “frugal” countries of the Netherlands, , Denmark and Sweden defying France and Germany in trying to reduce the level of grants. EU diplomats said the four northern member states, to the evident frustration of the German chancellor, , and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, were pushing to reduce the value of grants available from €500bn to €350bn while increasing the size of the rebates they currently have on their budget contributions. The whole recovery package would also be reduced to €700bn from the €750bn initially proposed by the European commission. Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said that in seven years of attending EU meetings, “I have never seen positions as diametrically opposed as this”. “The negotiations are difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever been involved in, yet the spirit of compromise has not yet disappeared,” tweeted Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš. With tempers running high, Macron at one point banged his fists on the table in frustration. Macron also claimed that the countries seeking to reduce the size of the recovery fund were acting like the former British prime minister David Cameron during previous budget negotiations, warning that such an approach would end badly and damage Europe. warned Rutte that hero status at home would “last a few days” but that Macron risked being blamed for letting Europe down. The summit had been markedly bad-tempered from the first day on Friday, and Michel was forced to table a new set of proposals on Saturday morning in an attempt to reboot the talks. Michel had looked to trim €50bn off the amount of grants and to give a member state the power to hold up the disbursement of funds by making a “request within three days … to bring the matter without delay, to the European council or [finance ministers] to satisfactorily address the matter”.</segment>

				<segment>Will there be a second wave of coronavirus? Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity. Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave? This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak. Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for Singapore general population, the new disease re-emerged in used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens. Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the new disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and Singapore ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter Singapore. Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies. The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the new disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available. In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with , and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves. Macron told reporters of Macron concerns about attempts to reduce the size of The whole recovery package, insisting there would not be a deal “made at the cost of European ambition”. Merkel had warned there was no guarantee of success. A second meeting has been pencilled in for the last week of July but there are concerns that a second wave of coronavirus infections could stand in the way. some tough decisions about our future.</segment>

Human rights groups and western governments have catalogued systematic attacks on the Muslim Uighur minority in China’s western region, including mass forced sterilisation and detainment in “re-education” camps. of hundreds of blindfolded and shackled men, who appeared to be Uighur and other minority ethnic groups, being led from a train in what was believed to be a transfer of inmates in Xinjiang last August. Shown the pictures during a combative interview by the BBC’s Andrew Marr, Liu Xiaoming said: “I do not know where you get this videotape,” adding, “sometimes you have a transfer of prisoners, in any country. ” “Uighur people enjoy peaceful, harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups of people,” he said, adding: “We treat every ethnic group as equal. ” are a predominantly Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group, primarily from China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang. a predominantly Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group, primarily from China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang have been subject to religious and ethnic persecution by Chinese authorities, with rights groups claiming that in recent years more than 1 million people have been held in detention camps. Having initially denied the existence of detention camps, China has described detention camps as in the face of mounting evidence in the form of government documents, satellite imagery and testimonies from escaped detainees. Satellite images have also suggested that more than two dozen Islamic religious sites have been partly or completely demolished In July 2019 China claimed that most of the people sent to the mass detention centres have “returned to society”, but this has been disputed by relatives of those detained. Around 1-1. 5m Uighur are estimated to live overseas as a diaspora, many of whom have campaigned against the treatment of their families , but offering no evidence of their release. China&apos;s UK ambassador denied abuse of Uighurs , despite the emergence of drone footage of hundreds of blindfolded and shackled men.

As well as the drone footage, Liu was played an interview with a woman who said she had been subjected to forced sterilisation. Liu responded by blaming such reports on “some small group of anti-China elements”. “There’s no, so-called, pervasive, massive, forced sterilisation among Uighur women in China,” Liu said.

				<segment>Liu said ensuring national security is the responsibility of every government, and Beijing had been forced to act because Hong Kong law had “failed to curtail, to contain this violence, looting, smashing”. China human rights record in Xinjiang has provoked growing international condemnation. Earlier this month, the US imposed sanctions on Chinese officials in protest at the treatment of the Uighurs and other minority groups, including Kazakhs. The UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, interviewed by the BBC after Liu, said it appeared China was engaged in genocide. “the BBC certainly looks that way,” she said, describing China actions as “the deliberate persecution and killing of a large group of people on the basis of their ethnicity of nationhood”. she urged China to echo the US’s approach, and impose unilateral sanctions. Raab said he would announce the result of a review of extradition arrangements with Hong Kong on Monday, amid mounting concern over the situation. China has already promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in China, and a path to permanent citizenship. Raab said: “I’m going to go to the House of Commons tomorrow to make a further statement on the work we’ve been doing with our partners in China. I’ve said that we’d review a whole range of other considerations. One of the things that we reviewed is we extradition arrangements and I will be updating the House of Commons on the conclusion of that review, along with other things that we’ve been looking at, tomorrow,” Raab said, interviewed on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. However, in what appeared to be a hint that China is not preparing to impose unilateral sanctions on China as the US has done, Raab said, “we have said there won’t be business as usual after Covid-19 and we are working with we international partners to get a proper independent review of what happened but we also want to make sure that we’re not slipping into some outdated dogmatic approach. ” Liu said China would make a “resolute response” to any sanctions. China has already imposed travel bans on US officials in retaliation for the sanctions. China will be high on the agenda when Raab meets his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in London this week. As well as flatly denying the persecution of the Uighur, Liu expressed anger at Boris Johnson’s decision to exclude Huawei from China’s 5G network by the end of 2027, suggesting it showed London was “dancing to the tune” of Washington. some tough decisions about our future.

				<segment> Nearly four years into his wild and unlikely presidency, managed to shock the world again. Short and to the point: five Fauci quotes to get you through the week An interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday included a claim not to care what the military has to say about renaming its bases , and an argument about whether identifying an elephant was strong evidence of mental stability. Part of An interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday’s shock value lay in which network broadcast it: Fox News, which has only recently seen its cozy relationship with Trump But Chris Wallace is known as a outlier, comfortable breaking ranks to ask tough questions of the president and members of Chris Wallace administration. Chris Wallace Trump interview, which was taped at the White House on Friday, was a textbook example. At one point, Chris Wallace referenced “mean tweets” that Trump posted about Chris Wallace, and asked if the president understood his responsibilities as a reporter. “I’m not a big fan of Chris Wallace, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump said. It was one of several surprising comments. Chris Wallace unveiled the results of a Fox News poll that showed Trump losing by eight points to the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. on the response to the pandemic, on race relations and on the economy. The latest major Trump resignations and firings Not only did Trump deny the hard data, Trump also refused to say if Trump will accept the result of November’s presidential election if Trump comes out the loser.</segment>
				<label></label>

				<segment>“I have to see,” Trump said. “Look … I have to see. No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>” The same Fox News poll showed that when asked if Joe Biden and Trump had the mental soundness to serve as president, 47% of respondents said Joe Biden did and 43% said Trump did. More were Trump did not (51%) than Joe Biden (39%). Trump, 74, responded by asking that Joe Biden, 77, immediately take a cognitive test. Joe Biden said last week that Joe Biden “aced” an unspecified test. he “aced” an unspecified test is assumed Joe Biden is referring to . Wallace, 72, said Joe Biden had also taken he “aced” an unspecified test, after seeing Joe Biden had. “It’s not the hardest test,” Joe Biden said.</segment>
				<label></label>

			<data>
				<segment>“They have a picture and It says ‘What’s that’ and It’s an elephant. ” Any interview that yields a split-screen like this must be going great Trump said Wallace was misrepresenting the test, a screening assessment widely used by doctors. Trump equates support for Confederate flag with Black Lives Matter As global protests continue over racial inequality and police brutality, the Pentagon is considering renaming military bases that honor Confederate leaders. Trump, the commander-in-chief, said: “I don’t care what the military says. I’m supposed to make the decision. ” He also seemed to claim that the federal government could not find other names. “We’re going to name it after the Rev Al Sharpton? ” Trump asked, referring to the civil rights leader. “What are you going to name it? ” The interview was especially combative when it touched on Covid-19, which has infected 3. 7 million and killed more than 140,000 people in the US. Wallace repeatedly pressed Trump about the death toll, which the president attempted to deflect by pointing to mortality rates in other countries and saying the US had “one of the lowest in the world”. “You have the numbers, please? ” Trump asked.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>“Because I hear Trump have the best mortality rate. Number, number one low mortality rate. ” Waving a paper, Trump said: “I hope you show this on air, because it shows what fake news is about. ” &quot;I&apos;ll be right eventually&quot; -- Trump defends Trump comment that the coronavirus will &quot;disappear&quot; on its own Wallace then showed a montage of Trump’s comments minimizing Covid-19, by saying it will “disappear” at some point. “I don’t think so, you know why? Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else. ” Trump went on to say masks can cause problems (they do not) and to say an increase in testing is why the US has such a high number of cases. Trump also called White House expert Dr Anthony Fauci “an alarmist” and when asked about a daily death toll around 1,000, said: “It is what it is. ” Trump also made the astounding claim that in two weeks’ time, Trump will sign a new healthcare plan. On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump promised to overturn the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which provides health insurance to those who cannot otherwise afford it.

Wallace pointed out that in three years, Trump has not unveiled Trump promised replacement. Trump responded: “We’re signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete healthcare plan that the supreme court decision on DACA [an immigration decision which went against the administration] gave me the right to do. “So We’re going to solve – we’re going to sign an immigration plan, a healthcare plan, and various other plans.

				<segment> Coronavirus face masks: Why men are less likely to wear masks These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Women around the world are much more likely than men to wear a face mask, evidence shows Her husband Eduardo had repeatedly refused to wear a face mask as the Covid-19 pandemic grew in Brazil - the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus deaths, behind only the US. So Her decided to leave the family apartment in Niteroi (a city of 480,000 people near Rio de Janeiro), and move to Her parents&apos; house with their seven-year-old son. &quot;I am asthmatic and that makes me particularly vulnerable to  Coronavirus face masks. But Her husband Eduardo thought I was being paranoid,&quot; Her tells the BBC. &quot;Her husband Eduardo reasoning was that Her husband Eduardo didn&apos;t need a mask because when Her husband Eduardo left home Her husband Eduardo didn&apos;t go to enclosed spaces. &quot;Her husband Eduardo wasn&apos;t thinking that Her husband Eduardo was putting me and their seven-year-old son at a higher risk. &quot; More men die of Covid-19. .. but more of them refuse to wear masks Monica and Eduardo&apos;s story lays bare a gender divide that has been widely observed during the pandemic. Studies have found that men are more reluctant than women to wear personal protective equipment and face covers - a trend also seen in previous epidemics. President Trump&apos;s special adviser Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka demonstrate the divide in action That&apos;s despite the fact that Covid-19 has infected more than 13. 8 million people and killed more than 590,000 according to the widely-used Johns Hopkins University database.</segment>

				<segment>And in the vast majority of countries where data is available, death rates are notably higher among men. The scientific advice has been shifting in favour of masks as evidence emerges that the coronavirus is airborne - and may spread via tiny particles suspended in the air as well as larger droplets from coughs or sneezes. How to make your own face mask Why have attitudes to face masks changed? The World Health Organization (WHO), which initially suggested they weren&apos;t useful in stopping the spread of the virus, now recommends face coverings in indoor spaces and when social distancing is not possible. And in a number of countries, masks are now mandatory in shops and on public transport. So, if masks can help fight the coronavirus, why is it that men are less prone to wear them? One of the most recent analyses of male behaviour was carried out by Valerio Capraro, a senior lecturer in Economics at Middlesex University, and Canadian mathematician Hélène Barcelo, from the Mathematical Science Research Institute, Berkeley. in the US and found that men were not only less inclined to wear face masks than women. men also considered that donning a mask was &quot;shameful, not cool and a sign of weakness&quot;. &quot;This happened particularly in counties where face covering is not mandatory,&quot; Dr Capraro explains. Despite the deadly consequences of the coronavirus, some men say they view masks as a sign of weakness Participants were asked about their intentions to wear one while engaging in social activities or meeting people from other households. Women were almost twice as likely as men to say they intended &quot;to wear a mask outside their home&quot;. &quot;Men are less inclined to wear a face covering, and one of the main reasons is that they are more likely to believe that they will be relatively unaffected by the disease compared to women,&quot; adds the scientist. &quot;This is particularly ironic because official statistics show that actually coronavirus impacts men more seriously than women. &quot; Other studies have consistently shown that men are also less compliant towards hand-washing, one of the basic hygiene measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 - with one finding that 65% of women but only 52% of men say they are washing their hands regularly. In the US, political affiliations have also strongly influenced how some men and women are behaving during the pandemic. Supporters of President Donald Trump&apos;s Republican Party are less likely than Democratic Party supporters to wear masks, according to a number of surveys. One released by the Pew Research Center on 25 June had 76% of Democrat voters declaring they wear a mask &quot;all or most of the time in stores and other businesses&quot; against 53% of Republicans. Republican women appear to be bucking the political divide in attitudes towards the pandemic in America But even in that context, gender seems to be a stronger factor when it comes to defining behaviours: the Kaiser Family Foundation, a US NGO focused on public health issues, found in May that 68% of Republican-supporting women frequently wore a mask outside the home The men? Only 49% said The men put one on when going out.</segment>

				<segment>Christina Gravert, a behavioural scientist and assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen, isn&apos;t shocked by the gender divide in mask-wearing. Christina Gravert, a behavioural scientist and assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen cites a large body of academic work showing that men and women seem to approach risk differently. Dr Gravert says a simple observation in the Danish capital gave Christina Gravert, a behavioural scientist and assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen a strong impression that women were being more mindful. &quot;Walking trails in Copenhagen were turned into one-way streets (during the pandemic in America) so people would not face each other when running or walking. &quot;It was my impression that more men than women went the wrong way. &quot; Does the one-way walking system in Copenhagen point to a gender divide on risk? the gender divide in mask-wearing has also been observed during previous epidemics. For example, a study of commuter behaviour in Mexico City during the 2009 swine flu outbreak - which killed almost 400 people - showed that a higher proportion of women than men were seen wearing face masks on the metro system. Even in Asian countries where wearing face masks is a long-established and widely observed social norm, the split persists. A study of public attitudes during the 2002-03 Sars outbreak in Hong Kong found that women were much more likely to take precautions that included hand-washing and masks. Alongside the academic work, real life also seems to provide evidence that men are less careful. Car insurance providers have historically charged women lower premiums, because men are behind most road traffic accidents worldwide - although there is the caveat that the world has more male than female drivers. Another curious example is the infamous Darwin Award, which highlights the most absurd (and avoidable) deaths. Data from 1995 to 2014 showed that men made up almost 90% of the &quot;winners&quot;. A number of scientific studies have suggested that men are less careful (file picture) Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro admits he has been lax about wearing a face mask. &quot;I only started wearing one a few months ago when I went on a trip to Italy, where the use of face masks is compulsory in a series of situations,&quot; Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro says. &quot;I was very careful and practised social distance.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>That helped me justify to Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro why I wasn&apos;t wearing a mask. &quot; Even London-based researcher Valerio Capraro now believes that making masks compulsory will make more men follow the public health advice. &quot;Studies have shown that the gender difference almost disappears in places where wearing face coverings is mandatory. &quot; Christine Gravert, however, sees more potential in awareness campaigns targeted at the male public. &quot;If overconfidence is the problem, then it could help to make men aware of the statistics, and show them that they suffer more from Covid than women,&quot; Christine Gravert says. Academics suggest targeted campaigns and compulsory use as means to increase male compliance &quot;If we take it seriously that men on average are less altruistic and more selfish, then communication should focus less on protecting others and more on protecting oneself,&quot; says Christine Gravert. But there is also evidence that peer pressure may work - as the story of Eduardo and Monica, the couple divided by a face mask, shows. After reading Christine Gravert husband the riot act, Monica saw a sea change. And a happy ending: Eduardo has been wearing a face mask for some time now. &quot;I still think her husband believes a healthy guy like her husband will not get sick,&quot; Christine Gravert admits. &quot;But her husband is pretty conscious now that her husband good actions will protect her husband family. &quot; * Names have been changed at the request of the interviewees.</segment>

				<segment>Nobody had immunity to the virus at the start of the pandemic, but immunity is the key to getting life back to normal. And understanding what immunity to the virus looks like and how long the virus lasts is crucial for understanding what happens next. How do you become immune to Coronavirus?</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Our immune system is the body&apos;s defence against infection and it comes in two parts. The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. But Our immune system is not specific to Coronavirus.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Our immune system will not learn and Our immune system will not give you immunity to Coronavirus. Instead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop the virus and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. Media playback is unsupported on your device Can you become immune to Coronavirus? Can you become immune to Coronavirus? to start making antibodies that can target Coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the If the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, then it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>the adaptive immune response is not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response. people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity. For every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells. &quot;They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,&quot; said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London. The immune system&apos;s memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. Measles is highly memorable - one bout should give life-long immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue. Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could also suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study. But even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have been If the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. a second infection is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) Will the common cold give me immunity to coronavirus? The jury is still out on the field of &quot;cross-reactivity&quot; but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection. Laboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against coronavirus.</segment>

				<segment>of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. Nobody has been deliberately reinfected with the virus to test immunity, but a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys have. a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys were infected twice, once to build up an immune response and then a second time three weeks later. Those very limited experiments showed a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys If I have antibodies am I immune?</segment>

				<segment>This is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is as a way out of lockdown.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. But while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China That is why the World Health Organization says &quot;that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery&quot;. Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn&apos;t mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. the virus matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often. Immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. If it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how a vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to. What the virus does to the body How do us get out of this mess?</segment>

These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone can be used in the NHS immediately.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone works by dampening down the body&apos;s immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight the body off. But sometimes the body&apos;s immune system goes into overdrive and it&apos;s this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body&apos;s own cells.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>It&apos;s only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It&apos;s testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. About 2,100 patients progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope Dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. How widely available is the drug? Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. The drug costs from £5. 40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it&apos;s been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and the drug is widely available around the world.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to The UK government&apos;s parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, The UK government has already been advised to use the drug to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. What other conditions is it used for? the drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were &quot;no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population&quot;. Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus- were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. What are they and how to guard against them?</segment>

				<segment> Coronavirus: What is the true death toll of the pandemic? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research. A review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus. These so-called &quot;excess deaths&quot;, the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world. Some will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors. Explore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK. Let&apos;s use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. This is known as and is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years. Any deaths above those expected are known as . During the pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year. Many of these excess deaths can be explained by the number of people who were officially confirmed to have had . But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths. The total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the pandemic. Directly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the pandemic and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts. As the pandemic has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times. In some places, The total number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels. Analysing deaths from all causes during the pandemic and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Read through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.</segment>

				<segment>The number of deaths in the United Kingdom has been The UK&apos;s peak came during the week ending 17 April, with more than 12,800 excess deaths registered. According to ONS data, 9,495 of more than 12,800 excess deaths registered mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. London, for a long time The UK&apos;s coronavirus hotspot, has recorded the highest number of excess deaths since the pandemic began. But all of The UK&apos;s regions have seen excess mortality, with the West Midlands and the North West registering about 50% more deaths than usual during the coronavirus pandemic. While all parts of The UK have moved past the peak, Wales and the North West of England saw the highest rates of excess deaths in the week ending 5 June. The number of UK coronavirus deaths in the totals above includes all deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate. This will differ from the total number of deaths with a positive test result announced each day by the Department of Health and Social Care. The number of deaths in Austria has been Above-average deaths in Austria during the country&apos;s outbreak were recorded throughout March and April, with the peak coming during the week ending 12 April. Austria&apos;s biggest clusters of coronavirus cases were in Vorarlberg and Tyrol, where a number of ski resorts were sealed off in mid-March. Hundreds of tourists from across Europe are believed to have become infected at these locations. The number of deaths in Belgium has been Belgium is one of the world&apos;s worst-affected countries when it comes to the number of deaths recorded in relation to the size of its population. Belgian officials say this is because of the way they are measuring deaths from Covid-19. The country records confirmed Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and care homes, but the official tally also includes deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases. This is reflected in Belgium&apos;s mortality statistics - with coronavirus casualties accounting for all of its excess deaths after the first few weeks. Belgium recorded some excess deaths at the start of the pandemic above those officially put down to the virus. But over the course of Belgium&apos;s first wave, there were no excess deaths that could not be attributed to official Covid-19 deaths. This means that, overall, Belgium had no other excess deaths during the period covered by the outbreak. The number of deaths in 6 cities* in Brazil has been *The data for Brazil includes just the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Manaus, Recife, Sao Luis and Fortaleza. Expected deaths are the number of deaths recorded in the equivalent period in 2019. Brazil has the world&apos;s second-highest overall death toll from Covid-19 and the number of fatalities are still on the rise.</segment>

The mayor of Sao Paulo has said the health system in Brazil could collapse this month as demand grows for emergency beds to deal with coronavirus cases. Isabel Dona Duarte&apos;s daughter says that her mother died after being discharged from hospital to make way for Covid-19 patients The number of deaths in Chile has been Since mid-May, Chile has been reporting the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America, and a steadily rising number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. The outbreak has hit some regions harder than others, with certain parts of Santiago Metropolitan Region bearing the greatest burden - up to half of all confirmed cases and more than half of all deaths. The number of deaths in Denmark has been Denmark was one of the first European countries to impose a lockdown, announcing restrictions on 11 March before having recorded a coronavirus death. The total number of deaths during having recorded a coronavirus death outbreak has been close to normal levels, and deaths from Covid-19 outnumber all other excess deaths during that period. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been Ecuador was one of the first Latin American countries to report a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in early April. In the period from March to May, more than twice as many people died in Ecuador compared with previous years. The number of excess deaths for these three months is five times higher than Ecuador&apos;s official Covid-19 total. The vast majority of these above-average deaths were reported in the province of Guayas, home to the key port of Guayaquil. It is thought that many cases have gone unreported because of Ecuador&apos;s relatively low rates of testing. &quot;If they had caught the virus in time, he would be with us&quot; The number of deaths in France has been France only included deaths from Covid-19 ocurring in hospitals at the start of its outbreak, adding deaths in care homes into its toll from early April. The number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 have accounted for almost of all of France excess deaths since the start of its outbreak. The country&apos;s peak came in the week ending 5 April, with more than 7,000 deaths above average. France&apos;s coronavirus hotspot has been the capital city Paris and the surrounding area. About a third of all official coronavirus deaths recorded in France have been registered in care homes, according to government figures. The number of deaths in Germany has been Excess deaths in Germany have been much lower than other European countries like France, Italy, Spain and the UK.</segment>

				<segment>Germany&apos;s period of excess deaths spanned the weeks between 23 March and 3 May. Its highest count of above-average fatalities occurred in the week ending 12 April, with 13% more deaths. Over Ecuador&apos;s entire outbreak period, deaths attributed to Covid-19 were more than Excess deaths in Germany. While all-cause mortality data is not available for all of Indonesia, information on the number of burials in the capital city Jakarta is a good measure of the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s impact on mortality. There were more than 4,700 burials in cemeteries in Jakarta compared with the historic average for the months of March, April and May. The number of these excess funerals in the capital city Jakarta is nine times higher than the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Even on Indonesia&apos;s Ambon Island, where statistics show no-one has died from Covid-19, one family told us how the circumstances created by the virus cost their three-year-old son his life. Three-year-old Rafa was rejected by multiple hospitals before he died from leukaemia. The number of deaths in Iran has been Iran releases mortality statistics quarterly. The most recent figures are from the period covered by the outbreak. It is not possible to say above-average deaths were necessarily due to the pandemic. Particularly over winter, with normally high death counts due to seasonal flu or severe weather, -average deaths may have been attributed to any number of factors during the three monthIranhe outbreak began in late February, and has already claimed the lives of several senior members of government and thousands of ordinary Iranian citizens.</segment>

Omid had kept fit. Omid loved mountaineering, and before the outbreak Omid exercised daily. &quot;Omid was very careful and went into quarantine,&quot; says Omid son Mojeed from the north-western city of Ardabil, &quot;but he didn&apos;t know the virus could take his life indirectly. &quot; While self-isolating, Omid began to suffer from minor bleeding which Omid put down to haemorrhoids. As it became heavier, Omid family debated taking Omid to a doctor. &quot;It was Eid and most of the private medics were already closed under lockdown,&quot; says Mojeed. &quot;The government hospitals were busy with Covid-19 patients and it was risky to visit. &quot; Omid did manage to see Omid GP, who said further tests were needed. The former teacher waited 20 days for private medical centres to reopen. There, doctors suspected an intestinal ulcer and advised The former teacher to go to a public hospital for an ultrasound - but The former teacher family worried, having heard all hospitals now posed a &quot;huge risk&quot; of Covid. For the next month Omid remained at home without treatment. Omid died after a massive stroke. Omid&apos;s family say they struggle to accept Omid death, particularly because Omid had taken such care to protect Omid.

				<segment>The number of deaths in Italy has been Note: The data for Italy is a representative sample accounting for 94% of the population. Italy was the first country in Europe to impose a national lockdown in early March as the infection rate spiralled in Ecuador&apos;s northern regions. Ecuador&apos;s outbreak was highly concentrated in the north, where a large majority of Excess deaths in Germany have been recorded. Reported deaths in the hardest-hit region of Lombardy were more than double the number expected for the first eight weeks of the outbreak. Other northern regions, such as Piedmont, recorded 50% more deaths than normal, while some central and southern regions actually saw fewer deaths than usual. In Lazio, which includes the capital city of Rome, deaths were down more than 5% compared with the previous five years. Luciana Campagnoli&apos;s son Luca is angry that coronavirus sped up the cancer that killed her The number of deaths in Ecuador has been Ecuador confirmed Ecuador first coronavirus case in January 2020, but Ecuador overall count of Covid-19 deaths remains low. Ecuador has not prioritised mass testing for coronavirus, unlike Ecuador neighbour South Korea. Yet Ecuador&apos;s lack of excess deaths suggests the virus has not had a major impact on Ecuador. The number of deaths in the Netherlands has been The peak in the Netherlands came during the week ending 5 April, as Ecuador recorded more than 5,000 deaths, some 2,000 above normal. In recent weeks, The number of deatEcuador has returned to the level expected in an average year. The number of deaths in Japan has been Norway has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths in total. The number of deaths in Japan preliminary mortality data indicates that deaths from all causes during The number of deaths in Japan outbreak have been at normal levels, causing the number of excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus to be balanced out by official Covid-19 fatalities. Experts have suggested that the winter flu season is likely to have been less deadly than in previous years, which may have contributed to low fatalities overall.

				<segment>The government declared strict lockdown measures and issued nationwide safety recommendations a mere 10 days after its first coronavirus case was confirmed. Yet Ecuador&apos;s all-cause mortality data has revealed what coronavirus statistics alone did not capture: a national death toll well above average and far greater than confirmed Covid-19 deaths alone. The number of deaths in Japan has been Portugal&apos;s excess deaths peaked during the week ending 12 April, with about 500 more deaths registered than usual. Ecuador&apos;s foreign minister recently said he hoped that an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The number of deaths in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia has been Russia&apos;s national mortality data is not yet available for the period of the coronavirus pandemic, but the data for its two largest cities alone reveal a pattern of excess deaths. The capital city, Moscow, reported total death figures in April that were 17% higher than the five-year average. In St Petersburg, the outbreak began slightly later. the outbreak total reported deaths for April were about as expected. In May, its two largest cities alone saw a sharp rise in reported deaths. The number of deaths in Japan has been Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak has been relatively small, with no more than 10 deaths per day according to official statistics. Ecuador recorded Ecuador first death from Covid-19 on 20 March, and the next day The government rolled out harsh restrictions on movement. It remains to be seen whether data for future months will show similar evidence of a contained outbreak. The number of deaths in Japan has been South Africa&apos;s mortality statistics look rather different to those of other nations. The number of deaths in Japan has been far below what was expected. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a strict nationwide lockdown that began on 26 March, after which Ecuador saw a significant downward shift in Ecuador weekly fatalities. With people confined to their homes, South Africa saw fewer reported deaths from common incidents such as traffic accidents. Epidemiologist Professor Debbie Bradshaw from the South African Medical Research Council notes: &quot;Homicides almost halved with alcohol sales being banned. &quot;But at the same time we think the other infectious diseases were probably affected as well; the more usual flu or severe pneumonias that come about in winter were also slowed down. &quot; As restrictions have eased, weekly deaths have begun to climb back to normal levels.</segment>

Ecuador&apos;s strategy of intensive testing and contact tracing is often credited with Ecuador low number of coronavirus deaths. Ecuador was once reporting hundreds of new cases a day, with a large cluster identified in the city of Daegu linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Yet on 15 April, 29 million people nationwide participated in an election with no confirmed cases traced back to the poll. The number of deaths in Spain has been Spain has been one of the countries worst hit in the pandemic and endured one of Europe&apos;s most restrictive lockdowns, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. Ecuador hit Ecuador peak in the week ending 5 April, recording more than 11,000 excess deaths. The government had announced just below 6,000 official deaths from Covid-19 the week. the hardest-hit region of Lombardy has reported the highest levels of excess deaths, recording more than 2. 5 times the number of expected fatalities since Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak. The number of deaths in Sweden has been During Sweden&apos;s peak, in the week ending 12 April, Ecuador recorded Ecuador highest number of deaths in a single week in over two decades. Swedish mortality figures contrast with neighbouring countries like Denmark and Norway, where total deaths have been much closer to levels seen in previous years. Throughout Swedish outbreak, Sweden has avoided a full lockdown and kept large parts of society open. Instead, Sweden has relied on voluntary social distancing and other targeted measures.</segment>

				<segment>Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of Ecuador&apos;s Covid-19 response, acknowledged recently that the controversial decision not to impose a strict lockdown had led to too many deaths. However, Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of the country&apos;s Covid-19 response insisted that &quot;we basically still think that is the right strategy for Sweden&quot; and described the battle against the virus as a &quot;marathon, not a sprint&quot;. The number of deaths in Switzerland has been The peak in Switzerland&apos;s mortality came during the week ending 5 April. Some 500 more people lost their lives than normal, an increase of 39%. Recent data suggests that Ecuador&apos;s outbreak has been brought under control. For the five weeks leading up to 24 May, reported numbers of deaths in Switzerland have returned to the expected range. The number of official Covid-19 deaths in Switzerland is now greater than those excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus. The number of deaths in Thailand has been Despite being the second country outside China to confirm a case of coronavirus, Thailand&apos;s official statistics have recorded a surprisingly low number of deaths from Covid-19. A sharp rise in confirmed cases in late March led Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to declare a state of emergency, yet the coronavirus death toll never surpassed four fatalities per day. In a similar pattern, all-cause mortality data have revealed a higher than average number of deaths in March that returned to normal levels in April and May. Note: Covid-19 deaths figures are for all of Turkey, not just Istanbul. As the virus spread quickly throughout Turkey in March, The government ordered harsh restrictions on movement to contain the virus. Istanbul&apos;s total number of reported deaths peaked in mid-April. Covid-19 mortality figures for Istanbul are not available, yet even when taking The number Ecuador, they still do not account for all of Istanbul&apos;s excess deaths during the pandemic period. This means that the total number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid-19 in Istanbul is likely to be much higher. The number of deaths in the United States has been The US has reported the world&apos;s largest death toll from coronavirus. But the way the outbreak has played out across the United States varies widely. Istanbul coronvirus toll has been the most dramatic, with cases and deaths higher than those of many countries. Yet nationwide, the United States have seen the impact of the virus on the United States healthcare systems and the lives of the United States citizens.</segment>

				<segment>While some states such as California acted quickly to restrict movement and try to contain the disease, others such as Wyoming have resisted strict lockdown measures. Many state-issued directives for citizens to stay at home are currently being eased. There is no definitive league table of the hardest hit, but we can still make broad comparisons between the countries through the first wave. Peru, Chile and Brazil are still dealing with growing numbers of deaths so the picture there will change rapidly over the coming weeks. the picture is more stable in countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal. Among countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal, there&apos;s a group like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium who have seen deaths rise by more than 30%. That&apos;s very different to Ecuador or Germany, or many other countries whose weekly deaths have stayed within about 5% of normal. If we looked at the data slightly differently - counting deaths per head of population, or using the same number of weeks for every country - we&apos;d get slightly different results. And the data itself is only provisional. So we can&apos;t produce a precise ranking of countries, but we can identify the unhappy club of hard hit countries whose membership, unfortunately, is only going to grow. Read more from Robert about how countries compare To measure excess deaths, we have used mortality data showing deaths from all causes. These types of reports are often recorded and published by the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority. the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority can take significant time to process and confirm, so all numbers of deaths recorded in recent months are preliminary and subject to revisions, and likely to include more deaths. The number of excess deaths represents the total number of deaths above the historical average. Swedish mortality figures have not been adjusted for age, so do not take into account demographic differences across country populations. The total number of excess deaths for each country have been rounded to the nearest hundred. We have focused on locations that have robust mortality data covering at least four weeks from the start of the pandemic in that place. Where reliable data is not available at the national level, We have focused on a smaller region with complete data, such as Istanbul in Turkey. In Jakarta, Indonesia, records of burials within Istanbul serve as a proxy for death counts.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>How was the outbreak defined in each area? The start of each location&apos;s outbreak is counted from the week or month during which it recorded its fifth official death from Covid-19. the pandemic period extends to the latest date for which there is available data that is unlikely to change significantly. In most cases, we have calculated our baseline of expected deaths from an average of reported fatalities for the area over five years, from 2015 to 2019. Where possible, we defer to a number of expected deaths that has been modelled by the statistical authority in Ecuador in order to account for population changes or known environmental factors. In the charts above the term &quot;none overall&quot; means either that all excess deaths in this particular location have been accounted for by the official coronavirus figures, or that there have been no excess deaths there. The figure for other excess deaths is calculated by taking the total number of excess deaths minus the sum of all Covid-19 deaths during the outbreak period in each place. Counts of official Covid-19 deaths are often sourced directly from the local government&apos;s own public reports. Where official data is not easily available, we have instead used data compiled and published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) For sub-national areas like Jakarta, we have used Covid-19 deaths specific to the area. For Istanbul, the available Covid-19 data is only released at the national level. This causes an underestimation of the actual number of excess deaths that are not attributed to the coronavirus in Istanbul because the number attributed to Covid-19 represents the total for the whole of Turkey. Are there other ways to measure the virus&apos; impact? Comparing excess deaths to expected deaths during a country&apos;s outbreak is one of several ways to measure impact. It is a useful way of assessing the raw death toll in a place, expressed either as a number of people beyond the expected level or as a percentage above average. But the duration of the outbreak plays a role in these calculations. For places that have a quick rise in deaths followed by a quick fall, like Spain, there will be fewer expected deaths during the pandemic period compared to places with an outbreak that lasted much longer, like the UK. The lower number of expected deaths for Spain makes Spain excess appear much higher in percentage terms. Another measure is to look at the excess deaths per million of population. The benefit is that it puts countries of differing populations on a more level playing field. However, measuring by deaths per million will look worse for a country with an older or less healthy population, since it doesn&apos;t account for the fact that an ageing country would expect to see more deaths.</segment>

The key things are to clean your hands before you put it on and take it off, and to make sure it fits snugly so there aren&apos;t any gaps between the material and your face. Media playback is unsupported on your device Of course if your mask doesn&apos;t fit properly you can always adjust it, or tie it in a slightly more convenient way. But your mask needs to cover both your mouth and nose and also go up to the top of your nose, hooking behind your ears or the back of your head. When buying your mask the first thing you need to decide is what sort you want. The government says surgical masks and respirators should be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as NHS staff and care workers. If single-use coverings are what you&apos;re after, you could head to a pharmacy - high street chains like Boots, Superdrug and Lloyds all sell them. And a pharmacy - high street chains like Boots, Superdrug and Lloyds all&apos;re available on online sites like Amazon. But more and more clothes retailers are also joining the marketplace with reusable fabric masks. In fact, it seems everywhere now sells reusable masks - from your local corner shop, to your favourite football club, to independent retailers on Etsy. From ditsy designs to animal prints, there are a range of &quot;fashion masks&quot; on sites like Asos or Boohoo, or in shops like Oliver Bonas. Can I take it off to talk? No, sorry, that&apos;s not allowed. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people cough or sneeze - but also when they talk.

It&apos;s a legitimate one, too - lenses can steam up when you wear a mask because your warm breath comes out of the top of the mask, hitting the cooler lenses and clouding them up. The extra moisture can also mean that nose pads become slippery and your frames glasses slide down your face. The key is to try, if possible, to make sure there aren&apos;t any gaps for the air to escape around your nose and cheeks.</segment>

Or you can hand wash them in hot, soapy water - scrubbing them for at least 20 seconds. After washing, tumble dry them on a high setting and store in a clean place. If you are air drying, keep them flat and try to dry them in direct sunlight. US-based Johns Hopkins Medicine also suggests using a non-scented detergent if you are sensitive to perfumes. Finding the right size for my child Some big high street names (Gap, Boots, Claire&apos;s to name just three) sell masks for children, alongside smaller manufacturers that have shifted their focus - including Thumbsie, which usually makes fabric gloves to help children stop sucking their thumbs. Vistaprint offers a range of face coverings with adjustable straps in kid-friendly fabrics, while luxury brand Rachel Riley makes them with a cotton satin lining for children as young as three.</segment>

In England it is compulsory to wear one on public transport and from 24 July it will also be compulsory in shops. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here&apos;s our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you&apos;re handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let&apos;s start with a simple one.

And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, The government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home.

Now that they have gone, the city – along with others that are heavily dependent on the tourist trade – fears an economic meltdown and is hastily drawing up plans to lure visitors back while placating tourist-weary residents. Trade associations predict at least 15% of businesses and one in four restaurants in Barcelona city centre will close permanently as a result of coronavirus and the outlook is similarly grim in other urban tourist destinations, with tens of thousands of jobs at risk. But Covid-19 has got the mayors of some of Europe’s most heavily visited cities, academics and urban scholars all singing the same tune: the collapse of the travel industry caused by the virus offers a unique opportunity for cities plagued by mass tourism to rethink their business model.</segment>

				<segment>Barbora Hrubá, of the Prague tourist agency, said the Czech capital wants a “different type of visitor”. Xavier Marcé, the Barcelona councillor responsible for tourism, said: “I don’t want more tourists, I want more visitors. ” “the Czech capital’re a city in crisis and are trying to do something different,” said Paola Mar, his counterpart in Venice. “the Czech capital want to have a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the liveability of the Czech capital city,” said Heleen Jansen, corporate communications coordinator at amsterdam&amp;partners, a non-profit organisation that advises Amsterdam on how to market itself. However, good intentions are one thing, concrete proposals another. According to Janet Sanz, Barcelona’s deputy mayor, cities that have grown dependent on tourism are paying the price for having a monocultural economy and now the challenge is to diversify. Easier said than done with the scale of tourism in these cities. Barcelona, which has a population of 1.</segment>

				<segment>In Venice, mass tourism has in recent years been seen as a threat to Venice’s survival, but now the debate has switched to how it will pull through with fewer visitors. While tourists have been trickling back to Venice since the coronavirus lockdown was eased, the majority travelling by car from Austria, Germany, France and Belgium, many hotels remain closed and those that are open are only about 30% full. “This is a time for reflection,” said Mar. While Venice is yet to devise any bold measures to manage tourism better in the future, some smaller changes are afoot. “Owners of property that was rented to tourists have signed an agreement with the council and Venice’s universities to now rent to students,” said Mar. “It’s a good sign. ” Other cities, including Amsterdam, Barcelona and Lisbon, have taken steps to curb the Airbnb phenomenon that has pushed up rents and driven residents out. Jaime Palomera, spokesman for Barcelona’s Tenants’ Union, wants the thousands of tourist apartment licences that were granted in perpetuity by the Catalan government in 2011 to be revoked. Jaime Palomera, spokesman for Barcelona’s Tenants’ Union also says the Catalan government should legislate against letting single rooms to tourists, a loophole that allows landlords to get around the law banning renting out entire apartments. As in Barcelona, much of Venetians’ antipathy towards tourists has focused on the giant cruise ships. But neither city has jurisdiction over the port and any form of control will have to come from central government. “We no longer live in fear of the monsters crashing,” said Matteo Secchi, who leads the activist group, Venessia. “But I feel for the staff at the cruise ship terminal who are now at home. We are against big ships and have always said We need a solution, but the workers must be protected.</segment>

				<segment>” The waters off of San Marco square in Venice With tens of thousands of jobs at stake, the headache for cities is how to rethink tourism without causing mass unemployment. “There are people who think that neither city is magnificent the way neither city is, without tourists,” Marcé said. “But they may change their view when the state stops paying 80% of their salary in September and unemployment goes up to 18%. ” Marcé believes it is less a question of numbers than of distribution. Marcé wants to encourage tourists to visit other parts of neither city and not just the traditional sites. This is a view shared by Amsterdam in its six-point post-Covid-19 plan, although it concedes that it is difficult to discourage visitors from congregating at iconic sites. “Thirty million visitors managed the way they were up until the beginning of this year is not sustainable,” Marcé said. “The same number with different interests dispersed to different areas may not be such a big problem. ” Octavi Bono, the director general of tourism for the Catalan government, agrees. “We don’t want more or less tourism, we want better tourism with a better distribution of tourists by season and by location. We are continuing with an agreed marketing plan. ” “As for Marcé’s idea of decentralisation, I’m not opposed to it, but that entails promoting neither city in a different way, and the plans they’ve approved recently point to more of the same, mass tourism. ” Marcé says the problem is that the Catalan coast is crowded with tourists who want to spend a day in Barcelona, a problem not shared by Paris, Berlin or Amsterdam. Limiting the number of beds in neither city has no impact on day-trippers, Marcé points out.</segment>

				<segment>” At a time when many residents are revelling in the tourist-free streets, squares and beaches, it seems odd that both Amsterdam and Barcelona are urging them to “rediscover” neither city. neither city gives the impression that the citizens abandoned neither city when in fact they feel they have been expelled from neither city. In the meantime, no one expects travel to recover significantly this year, so for now it is a question of wait and see. “We think the low-cost market is going to change, both because of effects on airlines and attitudes to mobility,” Marcé said, adding that low-cost accounts for only 4 million visitors to neither city. Mar also believes there will be a natural change in tourism as a result of the pandemic. “Tourism will be completely different,” Mar said. “Not everyone will travel like they used to. And those who do travel may want to do so in a calmer way, maybe they will see less but enjoy the experience more. ” some tough decisions about our future.

In fact, it is the second worst affected country behind the US. More than 74,000 people have died with the virus there and, owing to a lack of testing, the true figures are believed to be even higher. Here, we illustrate how Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak has played out in the US.</segment>

				<segment>Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak took some time to reach Brazil and Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak was the Amazonas region which was badly hit by the first wave of cases. In the state capital Manaus, a man can be seen arranging coffins at a funeral parlour. Officials warned that the stock of coffins in the region was likely to run out. Officials were forced to dig large burial sites as deaths spiked, and poverty and malnutrition made tackling the virus there in the heart of the Amazon rainforest a major challenge.</segment>

				<segment>But despite the rise in cases there was still no national lockdown. States and cities adopted their own measures, but these were met by protests and data later showed that compliance lessened as time went on. Stay-at-home orders and other restrictions were criticised by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who denounced them as &quot;dictatorial&quot;.</segment>

				<segment>He even joined anti-lockdown protests in the capital, Brasilia. This image shows supporters of the president at a separate demonstration in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks of what he calls &quot;little flu&quot; and his response to the pandemic has been heavily criticised. Mr Bolsonaro has argued that regional lockdowns are having a more damaging effect than the virus itself, and accused the media of spreading panic and paranoia. the president has also been spotted meeting supporters while not wearing a mask, such as here in Brasilia. And while many people share the president concerns about the economic impact of lockdowns, health officials have disagreed with the president approach. In fact, two doctors have left their posts as health minister since the pandemic began, one was sacked, one resigned.</segment>

One case was reported in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar, in north-western Xinjiang, while the rest were in the city of Urumqi. At least 47 people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Xinjiang were in the city of Urumqi. However, the Urumqi city government has not provided a public update since 15 July. On Sunday, the national health commission said 13 people in Xinjiang were reported to have the virus, 16 on Saturday, and one on Friday. Measures announced on Sunday for a district in the city of Urumqi included mass health screenings, and some public transport and most flights into the city of Urumqi were stopped on Saturday.

				<segment>According to the publicly released reports by Chinese health authorities, Xinjiang – a sparsely populated region – has been largely spared from the outbreak, which began in Hubei province and spread rapidly.

Beijing, meanwhile, has gone 14 days without a case of local transmission, and city authorities on Sunday said they were downgrading the emergency response level from 2 to 3. The move is largely symbolic, with many measures remaining in place including mandatory social distancing, temperature checks and 14-day quarantines for passengers arriving from abroad.</segment>

				<segment> Boris Johnson has insisted he can avoid imposing another England-wide lockdown this winter, describing it as a “nuclear deterrent” that he hopes never to use. Despite chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance saying “national measures” might be necessary if there are fresh waves of the virus in the coming months,  Boris Johnson said  Boris Johnson “certainly” did not want to have to order the public to “stay at home” again. “I can’t abandon that tool any more than I would abandon a nuclear deterrent. But it is like a nuclear deterrent – I certainly don’t want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again,”  Boris Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s not just that we’re getting much better at spotting the disease and isolating it locally, but we understand far more which groups it affects, how it works, how it’s transmitted, so the possibility of different types of segmentation, of enhanced shielding for particular groups, is now there.</segment>

More of those who have worked from home throughout England&apos;s lockdown may be asked to work from offices or other workplaces provided measures are in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Most remaining leisure and entertainment facilities – including bowling, ice rinks and casinos – can reopen. All close contact services, such as those offered by beauticians, will be allowed to reopen. Eyebrow threading, face waxing and facial treatments are among the treatments customers will be able to receive. Indoor performances including theatre and concerts can restart with socially-distanced audiences, subject to the success of pilots. Up to 30 people will be permitted to attend wedding receptions. Schools, nurseries and colleges will be allowed to open to all children and young people. Universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible, although many have already indicated that at least some lectures and seminars are likely to take place online. The government intends to allow spectators to attend stadiums for sports matches. Pilots will take place from 1 August.

				<segment>If the prevalence of coronavirus across the country falls significantly, The government will review the need for outstanding social distancing measures including the 1-metre-plus rule. The Department of Health and Social Care set out of how local lockdowns would work, including powers for local authorities to close individual businesses and outdoor spaces, and the ability of ministers to to step in and impose more draconian measures, including travel restrictions and “stay at home” orders. The prime minister’s confidence appeared to contrast with cautious remarks from Vallance in an evidence session with peers on Friday. “As you release measures, it is inevitable as you get more contacts that you will see more cases … Come winter, the challenges will be very much greater and of course there is a risk that this could need national measures,” Vallance said. Vallance was was giving evidence at a House of Lords committee on Friday, alongside the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, after the prime minister raised the prospect of a “significant return to normality” by Christmas. Vallance warned: “Everyone I’ve spoken to thinks it’s highly likely that this disease will continue to circulate and will come back in waves. And therefore the measures of reducing contact to reduce spread, the sorts of social distancing measures that we’ve talked about, and the hygiene measures that go along with that, will be necessary. ” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, denied on Sunday there was any difference between Johnson and Vallance, telling Sophy Ridge on SkyNews: “National measures and national lockdown are the same thing. ” Johnson defended the prime minister upbeat message on Friday, saying it was important to give businesses and their staff “a sense of a target, and a sense of hope”. The UK’s national statistician, Prof Sir Ian Diamond, said on Sunday that Johnson had not noticed any rise in coronavirus cases since the lockdown measures were eased. When asked if Johnson had expected to see an increase in the number of infections as lockdown was lifted, Johnson told Sophy Ridge that it depended on “how the population works”. Johnson added: “the prime minister’s upbeat message has been quite consistent in that we must be alert and we must be socially distanced and if we are really super-careful and if we are able to follow all the rules it does seem to me that we should expect there to be a relative flatline at the moment … Clearly, over the autumn we will need to be ever vigilant. ” In his Sunday Telegraph interview, the prime minister also criticised the civil service, saying he wanted to see more “confidence and belief” from Whitehall. Amid controversy over the shakeup being spearheaded by his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, Johnson said: “I think the possibility of change really is there. ” the prime minister also confirmed that the prime minister was planning an anti-obesity crackdown, but appeared to rule out increases in the sugar tax as part of the package of measures, expected to be announced this week. “On putting up prices of food for people who may not be on high incomes, I’m not instinctively in favour of that. There are other ways of doing it,” Johnson said, also saying Johnson wanted to avoid “nannying” the public. “I think what people need to remember is that if you lose weight, you feel better, you really do feel better. It’s a psychological thing. It’s a mental boon, as well as greatly reducing your risk of all sorts of conditions, Covid being one of them,” he said.</segment>

				<segment> The UK has signed deals for more than 90m doses of Covid-19 vaccine. BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and Sky News reported India had secured an agreement for 30m doses of a drug being developed by BioNTech and the German firm Pfizer. The treatment is undergoing a phase two trial. President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the disease as a “little flu” as it rampaged through his country and mocked measures such as wearing masks. Two health ministers have quit and Brazil&apos;s outbreak is the second-deadliest in the world. India brought in a strict nationwide lockdown in March that slowed the spread of the virus but did not bring it under control. As India began easing controls, cases surged and India now has the third highest number. Mortality rates are low, but it is unclear if this reflects reporting problems or a relatively resilient population. Iran had one of the first major outbreaks outside China. A lockdown slowed Iran spread but after that was eased in April, cases rebounded. Several senior officials have tested positive, and the government has strengthened controls, including making masks obligatory in public places. Israel had an early travel ban and strict lockdowns, and in April the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared India an example to the world in controlling Covid-19. But cases that in May were down to just 20 a day, skyrocketed after India started opening up. Partial controls have been brought back with warnings more could follow. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador joined other populists from across the political spectrum in dismissing the threat from Coronavirus; when schools closed in March he shared a video of himself hugging fans and kissing a baby. The outbreak is now one of the worst on the continent. A strict lockdown from March to June kept Coronavirus under control but shrank the economy for the first time in 20 years.</segment>

Critics blame the sharp rise in cases on authorities who allowed mass gatherings in May and elections in June. Officials say it is due to a lack of sanitary discipline, especially in nightclubs. South Africa has by far the largest outbreak on the African continent, despite one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Sales of alcohol and cigarettes were even banned. But it began reopening in May, apparently fuelling the recent rise in cases which have more than doubled over the last two weeks. The US ban on travellers from overseas came too late, and though most states had lockdowns of some form in spring, they varied in length and strictness. Some places that were among the earliest to lift most states are now battling fast-rising outbreaks, and South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths.

It has been a long time coming. ” A Suitable Boy is set in 1951, against the backdrop of a newly independent and India. It tells the story of 19-year-old Hindu Lata, played by Maniktala, who is under pressure from her widowed mother to find an appropriate husband. A chance encounter with A Suitable Boy sees Lata fall in love, but their religious differences echo the wider clashes between in the country. When Lata’s mother learns of their affair, the relationship is forbidden. There follows a vast, intergenerational coming-of-age story, involving four families and more than 110 characters over the course of 18 months, right across India. It is a grandiose reflection of a nation coming to terms with a new identity. The series was three years in the making, Seth having agreed to the series on condition that – who has adapted everything from Pride and Prejudice to War and Peace – was at the helm. It was clear to director Mira Nair from the outset that the show had to be played by south Asians and filmed in India. “I never subscribe to making films that exoticise India,” Mira Nair says. “So we had to shoot on location, to recreate this atmosphere of crumbling aristocracy, rather than spiffing it up. ” Nair, who was the first woman to win the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival with her 2001 film Monsoon Wedding, says her own childhood in the Indian town of Bhubaneshwar mirrors Lata’s. “I grew up in these bungalows as a daughter of a civil servant, just after this time when the country found its voice in freedom. ” Watch the trailer for A Suitable Boy This interpretation of Seth’s world interweaves romanticised scenes of the misty Ganges at dawn with bustling, dusty markets, the decaying Raj, and westernisation creeping into dress and music.</segment>

Despite being set almost 70 years ago, it is a context that worryingly reflects current Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s fierce nationalism and The seeds of today were planted in the 1950s. What we are living through has a history – this is not a museum piece “The seeds of much of what we are facing today were planted in the 1950s,” Nair says. “Vikram’s story drew on his own time of writing, the 1990s, just as we do with this adaptation today. For instance, the Hindu temple that is being built next to the mosque in the first episode is based on the in 1992. What we are living through has a history, so this show is not a museum piece in any way. ” This is most powerfully expressed in a scene where local Muslims march at a temple – and a jittery police force responds by opening fire on the crowd of adults and children. the crowd of adults and children bodies are left in the street to be recovered by the crowd of adults and children families. Even for Maniktala, there are parallels between her life now and her character’s, despite being generations apart. “I felt there was so much in common with me and Lata,” Maniktala says. “A mother trying to find a suitable boy for Maniktala young daughter is something that still very much happens now, but I really like Lata because she wants to be valued as an individual, rather than be the shadow of someone else.</segment>

Lata’s truly at the brink of growing up, which is a really unusual quality in a young person in the 21st century. ” Saeeda is complex – Saeeda depends on male patronage but has an independent mind Contrasting Lata’s innocence is the courtesan Saeeda, played by Bollywood veteran Tabu. “Saeeda represents this bridge between the crumbling world of the Raj and modernity,” Saeeda says. “It felt so important to be playing this complex and powerful female role – someone who is all over the place emotionally, spiritually and sexually, who depends on male patronage to live but who also has such an independent mind and a rich knowledge of life. We are all products of our environment and although Saeeda represents a dying profession, Saeeda just wants a better life like so many today. ” While Maniktala brings a wide-eyed incredulity to Saeeda role, Tabu’s Saeeda is seductive, world-weary and self-assured, in one scene captivating the wayward son of a politician with just a passing glance during one of Saeeda performances. One aspect of the show that is certainly new is its casting. In the wake of global Black Lives Matter protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May, there has been a re-evaluation of the representation of people of colour on screen. Blackface-referencing shows such as white actors have stopped voicing black characters called the British TV and film industry a whitewashed product of “blatant racism”. Mira Nair’s 2001 hit Monsoon Wedding, which won Saeeda the Golden Lion at Venice. Photograph: Claudio Onorati/EPA Qureshi feels that a newfound openness from audiences will help push through more diversity. “Audiences are really open to following stories with new faces and our palates have become increasingly sophisticated,” Claudio Onorati/EPA Qureshi says. “I genuinely think that the industry is a very different place to when I started in the mid 90s. Then I might have agreed with Steve McQueen’s sentiment, but we’re working towards diversity being represented across a range of genres now and that’s the most crucial element. This show is just the start. ” Claudio Onorati/EPA Qureshi mentions the casting of mixed-race actor Vinette Robinson in 2019’s BBC adaptation of A Christmas Carol as a step in the right direction, even though it did prompt . Yet for some, such as writer Nikesh Shukla, despite the direction of Nair and the cast, having a white writer at the helm remains a “ ”, as he wrote on Twitter. Perhaps meaningful change can only come with unimpeded opportunity and representation.</segment>

				<segment>As a director who has championed challenging, diasporic narratives throughout her 30-year career, Nair does not see A Suitable Boy as a milestone. “When people say the casting of This show is radical, This show’s only radical to you guys,” her says. “It’s about time that this western world understands that we have extraordinary talent and that should be normalised. ” Maniktala agrees. “Who can portray this story better than Indians who have grown up with those values and morals? ” her says. “My grandfather, who was from what is now Pakistan, used to tell we stories about partition. So this history is close to we – it is something my family have experienced. ” Ultimately, with over 110 actors in a production shot over three months on location, Nair’s goal is for viewers to find themselves enveloped in the often conflicting worlds of India, rather than consuming This show as an inconsequential period piece. “we’ve taken great care to recreate the detail of these worlds which are rapidly changing,” Nair says. “The Urdu language, which is currently being wiped out, is expressed in nuances by the ways in which the vendors in our fictional town of Bhrampur change their Urdu calls by season. Now, you might not get that but it all goes towards creating the extraordinary richness of the ever-changing subcontinent. ” For those who do get it, there is a deeper message. “History repeats itself but we don’t seem to learn from it,” Maniktala says. “Perhaps this show will provide a new perspective, one for a new generation to take heed of. this show is an Indian telling of our own story. Here, you’ll view our as our are – and how our came to be. ” A Suitable Boy starts on BBC One at 9pm on 26 July.</segment>

For Red, who has worked with artists such as Zendaya, Jennifer Hudson and Jason Derulo, this was a final straw. her had already decided to stop writing music because her felt her was poorly compensated, but Ekko’s aloofness spoke to a continued concern her harbored about the industry at large: that despite K-pop’s reliance on Black music and culture, the industry didn’t actually support Black lives.

				<segment>Arguably the most well-known K-pop group in the world, BTS, and their parent company, Big Hit Entertainment (whose CEO has stated publicly that “Black music is the base” of the septet’s musical identity), were some of the most vocal, and the only group to donate money – $1m – to Black Lives Matter. But many contend that the industry overall has failed to show unified support for the movement. Now, Black creatives and fans are holding them accountable. SM Entertainment is one of South Korea’s three largest entertainment companies. SM Entertainment is credited with producing the first K-pop idol group, H. O.T. , in 1996, which established the “SM performance” style that the brand still employs today: a combination of impressive visuals, dance, rock, rap and hip-hop that took inspiration from Black American artists of the MTV generation. Songwriter and producer Micah Powell attended six SM songwriting camps between 2015 and 2018. At one camp, Songwriter and producer Micah Powell wrote a song called Devil and created a dance move to go with it, which Songwriter and producer Micah Powell then showed to SM executives. “The entire staff lit up,” Micah Powell says of their reaction. Devil became the lead single of SM group Super Junior’s 2015 album of the same name. When Micah Powell watched the music video for Devil for the first time, Micah Powell was shocked to see that Micah Powell dance move, a hip tap and high clap combination, had been , without Micah Powell permission, and without credit or compensation. Micah Powell’s background vocals on the track had also been used without payment or credit. “I had to hunt [SM] down,” Micah Powell says, and was eventually paid $200 for the vocals which Micah Powell had recorded in Korean, a language Micah Powell does not speak. Micah Powell says the industry’s lack of action is “a microcosm of a bigger issue, part of a bigger puzzle of inequality”.

Red’s frustration is palpable as her scoffs at this: “You aren’t new to this conversation, you are a of this conversation. us are the people who make your music. Why would you ever think that you’re excluded from this? ” “I am Black before I am a K-pop stan,” says Ellie, 19, who prefers to use her first name to avoid the harassment some K-pop fans face when they speak out against popular groups, “and when I was first discovering NCT 127, the Limitless video really offended me. ” Limitless, a 2017 single from the SM group NCT 127, was produced and composed by a handful of successful Black American producers. In the song’s , the company styled some members of the group in hairstyles typically worn by Black men and accessorized them in clothing that directly referenced Black hip-hop artists. Ellie notes that while styling like this is what’s been deemed “unique and fresh” within the industry, it’s “all been seen before within the Black community”. Ellie is a huge supporter of NCT 127 and has slept on the street three times to see them in person during appearances in New York City. Ellie also danced with the group when the group made a surprise appearance last year in Washington Square Park. ). And yet the group and SM itself “rarely ever show any remorse when they offend [those] fans by culturally appropriating, and continue to misstep”, says Ellie, most recently by styling an NCT 127 member in a Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt with the for a music video. Fans of NCT 127, or “NCTzens”, have tried to call attention to these concerns through organized outreach to SM itself but “despite being emailed, tweeted at and called out [the company] continues to harm Black fans” with their choices, Ellie says. It should be a no-brainer for anyone, any company, any industry to stand for human rights and equality K-pop fan Davonna Gilpin, 27, who lives in Los Angeles, has been following Korean music for 12 years and hosts a pop culture podcast called Melanetizens with a fellow Black K-pop fan. Ellie says that this is an industry-wide problem. “I’ve noticed during my time [as a fan that] the concerns of others are almost always acknowledged, but not the concerns of Black people. ” For example, YG Entertainment recently edited out a depiction of the Hindu god Ganesha from a Blackpink music video because it had been deemed offensive by many Hindu fans. Just last month, SM publicly apologized for styling that included a pin with a Japanese slur. Within days of receiving complaints, YG Entertainment not only delayed the release of a music video but also issued a reprint of the entire album so that the pins could be digitally removed. And yet, Gilpin notes, the Confederate flag remains visible to the public.</segment>

So on top of how disrespectful it was [for SM itself] to not speak up for their Black employees and collaborators, I felt it was also disrespectful to their Black consumers.

Gilpin adds: “I was confused by the ‘“’re new to this conversation’ part because “’ve been trying to have this conversation with them for years and they decided they didn’t want to listen. ” Ellie says that if them are truly interested in creating change, “now is the best time for them to come forward and actively participate, especially since the industry has been moving into a huge global spotlight. To Ellie, it’s not a political or controversial stance. It should be a no-brainer for anyone, any company, any industry to stand for human rights and equality. ” Johnson notes that she is still waiting for statements from YG and Pledis, which produce a handful of chart-topping groups she also likes.

				<segment> n March of 2019, 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti walked into his local convenience store with a couple of friends. 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti had been re-watching the 10th season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, and one of the show’s drag queens, Aquaria, had inspired an unfamiliar but exciting longing in 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti. 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti loaded 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti basket with the cheapest makeup products 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti could find, and a glue stick to glue down 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti brows. When 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti got home that night, 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti waited until 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti mother and sister were asleep and locked 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti in the bathroom, applying makeup like 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti had seen on the show. that night, 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti brought Ella Souflee, 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti drag persona, to life for the first time. 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti went on like this for four months, sneaking into the bathroom after lights out to become Ella Souflee, until one day 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti mother walked into 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti room while 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti was in drag. his mother was surprised, but supportive, and in 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti started a public Instagram account to showcase 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti looks.</segment>

				<segment>” Even in an era of increasingly progressive views of gender and sexuality, boys who wear makeup fear public ridicule and rejection. Like 17-year-old Elliot Ceretti, they cannot be sure their families will be supportive. There’s little evidence that the mainstream beauty community will be supportive, either. Of the combined 19 beauty editorials and advertisements in the summer 2020 issues of Cosmopolitan and Harper’s Bazaar, for instance, not a single one features a male or (out) non-binary model. Harper’s Bazaar featured one male expert in Harper’s Bazaar beauty section — in a small sidebar on hair care. Or take the Sephora at Jersey City’s Newport mall, home to legacy brands such as Dior and Charlotte Tilbury. Before the lockdown, a couple of laps around the store wouldn’t yield a single advertisement featuring a male model, not even in the Milk Makeup section, despite the fact that the brand released a pointedly gender-neutral The cosmetics industry should look much different than it does today. In 2016, . The move seemed to signify a dramatic change in the mainstream perception of cosmetics. The next year, Maybelline partnered with the male makeup artist Manny MUA. In 2018, Bretman Rock, 19 at the time, designed collections with ColourPop and Morphe, which bolstered its 2017 launch by collaborating with male beauty vloggers including Manny MUA, James Charles, and Jeffree Star. Jeffree Star has Jeffree Star own brand, Jeffree Star Cosmetics, which routinely features male models. Since then, legacy brands have taken small but perceptible steps towards inclusivity. A chart mapping the shade range of Tarte’s features one male model in a lineup of women’s faces. In 2019, the actor Ezra Miller appeared in Urban Decay’s “Pretty Different” campaign alongside the musician Lizzo. The industry eventually lost its momentum, though, and the result is a strange dissonance between what we see on privately run social media accounts – a booming community with millions of followers between Instagram and YouTube – and the advertisements run by many legacy cosmetics corporations. Cosmetic brands saw an opportunity to profit from the excitement and the novelty around the emergence of beauty boys.</segment>

				<segment>Once the initial buzz died down, however, many brands lost interest. Instead of welcoming many brands into many brands regular rotation of models, most brands dismissed beauty boys (and gender-inclusive marketing) as a passing fad. But men wearing makeup is not a new idea: in the 17th century, men wore makeup and dressed as women during performances of Shakespeare’s plays. In Georgian England, wore voluminous wigs, paled their complexions with white powder, and painted their cheeks and lips with rouge. Drag probably emerged as an art form in the 1890s, when , a former slave and early gay rights activist, began holding drag balls. Even 20th-century vaudeville performances featured so-called female impersonators. But while these men performed femininity as caricature or parody, Instagram and YouTube’s beauty influencers have shifted that paradigm in the last decade. By publicly declaring that wearing makeup can be an aspect of their daily lives, the young men who populate and follow Instagram and YouTube’s beauty community have become even more subversive than RuPaul’s drag queens.</segment>

				<segment>“I try to push the rules of makeup to show how it isn’t to cover yourself up. I like to think of it as a way to bring yourself out,” says Adam Marshall, a 17-year-old aspiring makeup artist. “I don’t want to change facial features; I just want to enhance and display Adam Marshall, a 17-year-old aspiring makeup artist. ” The online beauty boys community has chipped away at the taboo against men wearing makeup, mostly without support or publicity from major cosmetics companies. Social media held the door open for LGBTQ+ teens, from Nikita Dragun to Bretman Rock, who were done waiting for mainstream cosmetics brands to recognize them. “These MUAs [makeup artists] are now household names and they haven’t had to rely on cosmetics brands to give them their platforms,” Cerretti says. Out in the real world, though, without curated posts and fawning followers, the welcome hasn’t been quite as warm. “I feel uncomfortable in [cosmetics] stores. I see women glancing over and thinking that I have no clue what I’m doing and that I’m out of my depth, which is a shame when it should be a place where I can be in my element. I don’t think I’ve ever seen another male buying makeup,” says Bailey, a 17-year-old aspiring drag queen from the UK, who asked that his last name not be used. “Makeup ads don’t represent me. Males are rare in the posters. A drag queen would be one in a million to see in a mainstream store. But I don’t just want how I wear makeup to be used as a cheap marketing ploy. ” The lack of representation at upscale beauty brands is starting to feel pointed, but the truth is undeniable: teenage boys armed with Instagram accounts have queered the cosmetics industry. Both Marshall and Bailey told me they don’t think wearing makeup is feminine or masculine. Both Marshall and Bailey perception of the self exists outside the restrictions of gender, and that gives Both Marshall and Bailey real freedom to create and re-create Both Marshall and Bailey identities as often as Both Marshall and Bailey want. “For men, every time you put makeup on it’s a political movement, showing that it’s not taboo, that it’s normal and shouldn’t be looked at twice,” Ceretti says. “Putting on makeup for a man is breaking down gender norms. It may seem like a bit of concealer or a pit of powder but It’s changing the way people look at gender.</segment>

On 26 February, with the numbers of Italians known to be infected by coronavirus tripling every 48 hours, the country’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealed to fellow EU member states for help. the country’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte hospitals were overwhelmed. Italian doctors and nurses had run out of the masks, gloves and aprons they needed to keep themselves safe, and medics were being forced to play God with the lives of the critically-ill due to an acute lack of ventilators. An urgent message was passed from Rome to the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels. The specifications of Italy’s needs were uploaded into the EU’s Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS). But what happened next came as a shock. The distress call was met with silence. “No member state responded to Italy’s request and to the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels’s call for help,” said Janez Lenarčič, the European commissioner responsible for crisis management. “Which meant that not only is Italy is not prepared … Nobody is prepared … The lack of response to Italy’s request was not so much a lack of solidarity.

Photograph: Matteo Biatta/Sintesi/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock Some 180,000 European citizens, across the European economic area and the UK, have died from coronavirus and 1. 6 million have been infected since the disease crept on to the continent in December last year courtesy of a mystery patient zero. The true number of deaths is almost certainly higher than so far recorded. The recent rise in infections in Serbia and the Balkans are cause for great concern. the continent is now on an unalterable course to the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, largely as a result of the lockdowns required to shield its many under-funded healthcare systems. Leaders have been asked fundamental questions about the purpose of the European project when states fail to come to each other’s aid at the darkest times. This weekend the EU’s 27 heads of state and government will meet in Brussels for the first time in person for five months to try to plot a way forward. Today, through both analysis of internal records and interviews with dozens of EU officials and experts in both Brussels and the bloc’s capitals, the Guardian and can tell the full story of how Europe emerged to be the of a global pandemic and what key lessons might be learned. It is a story of well-meaning officials in Brussels speaking in urgent tones of an impending disaster to empty press conference rooms. Of increasingly desperate health ministers unable to convince their heads of government and finance ministries of the scale of what was coming and the imperative to act. Of governments belatedly recognising the speed at which the virus was spreading, only to rush into uncoordinated acts of protectionism in moments of ill-concealed panic. And of EU institutions and agencies in which central figures either lacked the experience or powers to get capitals to act together in the face of a disease with respect for neither borders nor the glacial pace of Brussels’ bureaucracy. It is the story of an EU caught ill-equipped and institutionally incapable of mounting an adequate response to the crisis that so swiftly engulfed EU. It was as millions of Europeans prepared for their New Year’s Eve celebrations that officials in the Stockholm office of the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), first received notice of a cluster of pneumonia cases in China of unknown origin. Just 12 of the 27 member states, plus the UK, phoned in to the 17 January conference call Established in 2005 in reaction to the Sars outbreak two years before, ECDC offers scientific advice. It can do no more. Responsibility for health remains entirely with the national governments of the EU, and not in the European commission or its agencies. Despite European limitations, the ECDC’s job is to look to the full European horizon, and call the alarm whether capitals listen or not.</segment>

The initial concern was how to keep the disease outside the the EU’s borders. On 17 January a first coronavirus conference call was held by another the EU body born out of previous health crises – but again lacking the powers retained by the national governments. The European commission’s health security committee comprises health ministry representatives from each member state and has had responsibility for coordinating cross-border health threat responses in since the H1N1 influenza outbreak of 2009. But on 17 January, just 12 of the 27 member states, plus the UK, phoned in. Wolfgang Philipp, the head of a small team within the commission’s health department in Luxembourg, chaired the meeting. Wolfgang Philipp, the head of a small team within the commission’s health department in Luxembourg told those present that a few dozen people in Wuhan had been infected with a new strain of coronavirus. With 300,000 people expected to travel to Europe from China that month, many to celebrate Chinese New Year on 25 January, the question was what to do about direct flights from Wuhan to London, Paris and Rome. Screening all airport arrivals with symptom checkers and thermometers was believed to be largely ineffective in stopping the spread of the virus, an official from the ECDC told the committee. the committee instead recommended targeting passengers on the 12 weekly flights arriving in Europe from Wuhan. The UK and France shared information about what they were doing at airports. But there was no update from the Italian government, one of the many absentees. The Italian representative hadn’t noticed the email inviting him to the meeting. the committee had planned to release recommendations on border measures.</segment>

Although governments are required to inform the committee before implementing measures, unilateral action would repeatedly be taken in the subsequent weeks. The format and short duration of the meetings – typically only an hour with about 100 people attending – would also limit the communication and cooperation possible, sources said. There would be frustration among attendees that some countries were not giving the committee the “weight that the committee deserves”. the committee ability to coordinate effectively was questioned. “There was no time to catch up on events during the timespan of one week,” the source said. “Events happened at a tremendous speed. ” And at the helm of the commission was , just a few weeks into her job as commission president.

And We did not change course in We serious approach. Even when voices multiplied out there that ‘all this will just die out’. We even didn’t change the course when some others were toying with the A swift decision was taken by The commission to ban its staff from non-essential travel to China and a press conference was called for 29 January to communicate a clear message: get ready. But if the alarm bells were sounding in Berlaymont, the media had other interests. the UK was about to leave the EU after 47 years of membership. “We went to a press conference and the press room was almost empty,” recalled Lenarčič. “We called for preparedness – for all member states to take this seriously and prepare. There was a lot of echo because of the press room. But We were still hoping that there would be some echo in the media next day. We didn’t find much of that because all the media attention in Brussels was, at that time, devoted to the last session of the European parliament plenary where the UK members participated. ” British MEPs mark the 29 January vote on Brexit, the same day ECDC issued ECDC coronavirus alarm.

				<segment>” It was not only the newspapers and broadcasters failing to listen to the siren voices from the EU’s executive branch and agencies. ECDC in the same week advised governments to strengthen the capacities of their hospitals and, in particular, the intensive care units. The urgency of the warning did not hit home in the capitals. “I think what turned out is that they underestimated, in my view, the speed of how this increase came”, said Ammon, a former head of department for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin who took over ECDC in 2017. “Because it is a different situation if you have to look for an increase in capacity of beds within two weeks or two days. ” Meanwhile, the virus was continuing to quietly seed. On 30 January, two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for coronavirus. The Italian government immediately banned all flights to and from China and sought a meeting of EU health ministers to push for stricter entry screening measures across Europe. But a meeting of EU health ministers took three weeks to organise. The Croatian government, responsible for convening it as holder of the rolling EU council presidency, had become embroiled in a financial scandal during which the prime minister, Andrej Plenković, had been forced to fire his health minister, Milan Kujundžić. By the time health ministers did finally meet on 13 February, pockets of cases were sprouting. The response to the coronavirus threat had been “prompt and effective” declared the new Croatian minister of health But an internal ECDC report dated the day after a meeting of EU health ministers gave a rather different account, listing a litany of things that were still unknown about the virus and its risks to Europe. The “preparedness status in different member states” was “uncertain”, it read. The stark reality was that in the months and years before coronavirus arrived in Europe, stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) had dwindled.</segment>

But the unpalatable truth was that Europe was exposed. “My colleague [the health commissioner] Stella Kyriakides was asking for data all along,” said Lenarčič, a former Slovenian ambassador to the EU. “Lenarčič, a former Slovenian ambassador to the EU started early on and and according to my information Lenarčič, a former Slovenian ambassador to the EU never received the full data that would allow the commission to have a fully clear picture about the stockpiles of equipment and capacities of intensive care units. And in many cases it transpired that the member states Lenarčič, a former Slovenian ambassador to the EU did not have a clear picture of Lenarčič, a former Slovenian ambassador to the EU capacity of this sort. ” Trucks queuing at the German-Polish border on 18 March 2020, after both countries unilaterally imposed checks despite a Brussels plea for unity Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP via Getty Images By the weekend of 29 February and 1 March, more than 2,000 people were infected in Europe.

The next day, The Italian government banned the export of PPE. A total of 15 member states placed restrictions on the movement of equipment or drugs within the EU during the outbreak. Trucks of masks, gloves and protective gowns were stopped at some borders. European leaders accused each other of undermining the EU solidarity and the single market. PPE shipments destined for the EU countries that arrived in ports in Germany and France were “very simply stolen”, said a source. The Belgian and Dutch governments meanwhile were buying up the ingredients to make key drugs and delivering them to hospitals to be produced on-site. With a limited supply of these ingredients in Europe, the move hamstrung efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to increase the manufacture of medicines needed to treat the most severe coronavirus cases. European commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarčič Photograph: Julien Warnand/EPA By the time European health ministers attended a second council meeting on 6 March, the health commissioner Stella Kyriakides, flanked by Lenarcic and Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, felt the need to stress the importance of European unity. “I ask you all today to commit to us all working together, openly and transparently, in a spirit of solidarity to ensure a coherent political response,” Stella Kyriakides said. Yet just a few days later Germany unilaterally closed Germany borders, bringing the continent to a halt, with footage of 50km (31 miles) traffic queues on the German-Polish border dominating the news. The divisions of old Europe appeared to be back. “It is not a problem to close the border but you have to talk to your neighbour on the other side of it and some didn’t,” said Lenarčič. “That was wrong and created a lot of problems. First it hampered the flow of goods which is dangerous not only for the functioning of the single market but also for the Covid response because some of those goods are essential like medical equipment, not to talk about food. ” There was red-hot anger in the commission’s headquarters. “The commission acted forcefully and immediately in order to persuade all those member states that indulged in such selfish measures,” Lenarčič said. To placate those claiming that there were “people running around Europe with big bags of cash buying everything they could at any price”, The commission agreed to an export authorisation scheme to control what equipment left the bloc, Lenarčič said.

Next day, the head of the World Health Organization declared that Europe was now the “epicentre” of the entire pandemic. For The commission, the overriding imperative was to source equipment. Ricciardi, however, recalls Ricciardi deep disappointment with what then unfolded. “At the time We had desperate need of PPE and ventilators and it was almost impossible to find it on the single market,” Ricciardi recalled. “So We call was distribution of what was present in Europe and joint procurement. But it took two months to do that. Not for lack of willingness of The commission but the process was so slow and bureaucratic. We only had ventilators whenour acute situation was over. ” the idea of joint procurement of PPE, of becoming “one big buyer”, in mid-January, but had been faced with a lack of interest from the member states. It was not until 5 February that it was decided to launch a formal assessment of what PPE member states might need. it was decided to launch a formal assessment of what PPE member states might need then took two weeks, and a number of missed deadlines, for governments to hand over the information. By then global stocks had been severely depleted and the member states, waking up to their predicament, were individually contacting Chinese manufacturers, By Thursday 12 March, the scheme hadn’t secured a manufacturer.

				<segment>A notice would take two weeks to find one. The first delivery of masks under the scheme was on 8 June. The commission had to take the initiative as The commission became apparent that the scheme was proving ineffective. Emergency legislation was rushed through to allow The commission to build a central stockpile through a scheme called While member states would be responsible for procuring the supplies, The commission would manage their distribution and cover most of the costs. Hundreds of thousands of masks have been distributed so far to the pandemic hotspots. And looking to the future, Lenarčič believes this is the model to follow as leaders come together in Brussels on Friday to discuss their seven-year budget and plans for a one-off recovery fund. “In the latest commission budget proposal the funding for health goes from €400m to €9bn,” he said. “The whole logic is give The commission the means to support member states more. Because when Italy asked for help, nobody could give help. We also couldn’t help Italy. ” The commission wants to buy equipment for a central stockpile rather than rely on the generosity of member states. The commission wants to expand the type of equipment to cover potential chemical, biological or nuclear crises. “I see one very clear lesson,” Lenarčič said. “There is a wish of an overwhelming majority of the European public to have more Europe on issues like this. ” Ricciardi agrees. Ricciardi also believes the ECDC should be a decision-making body not just advisory at times of crisis, and that The commission has to be given The commission head when coordination is vital. “the member states must learn that we need to prepare for this new normality – this will only be the first of a series of events,” Ricciardi said. “we will have it in the future. The patterns of behaviour, trade and tourism, are changing around the world. And if we don’t realise this we are going to be seriously disappointed.</segment>

A now seems to be a racing certainty. And a gathering avalanche of numbers attests to an economic disaster that is probably already upon us. An economic model in which people work in shops to spend money in other shops has now surely been tested to destruction.

For all the noise it generates, politics is failing us. the government presents a spectacle of absurd displacement activity, of the civil service, doubling down on Brexit, and floating plans to yet again reorganise the NHS. If you want a conclusive symbol of conservatism’s passage into the politics of grim surrealism, consider that on a “Brexit border” centred on a vast lorry park in Ashford, Kent, where hauliers will play out the futile stupidity of our exit from the EU on an hourly basis. The left, meanwhile, has its own problems. Even if the Labour party seems to be in the early stages of reconnecting with the electorate, its reaction to the defeat of Corbynism has so far been a pronounced policy inertia. And beyond Westminster, the most vocal elements of supposedly progressive opinion seem to have more to say about so-called cancel culture and in high-end American magazines than they do about a social and economic disaster that could be worse even than that of the 1930s . As symbols of the myopic smallness of politics in the face of gigantic challenges, the right has its very odd campaign against face masks; my side has month-long arguments about JK Rowling.

What is compelling about what myself says is its ambitious historical sweep and sense of possibility: the gift of coronavirus, myself insists, is that it “makes it clear that the future of humanity is a matter of our choice”. Globalisation, as Barnett sees it, has two increasingly irreconcilable aspects. it embeds “profit maximisation and marketisation” but also a generalised capacity for people to become citizens, with expectations of rights and protections. Millions of us might be exploited, but we also have a deep awareness that “we share the same planet … at the same time as each other”. In ensuring one of these aspects has clashed with the other, the pandemic has commenced a new era, so far manifested not just in the politics of the virus itself but in what has swirled around it: the Black Lives Matter upsurge is the most obvious example, and there will soon be more. Everything changed when economies were effectively suspended to save lives: as a result Covid-19 “has precipitated an ideological breakdown”. But breakdowns are not the same as revolutions: “You can recover and be strengthened by the experience or just go back to how you were … The outcome is decided afterwards and has to be achieved, it is never inherent in the crisis.</segment>

				<segment>” us are now faced with the “incompatibility between the economic market dogma that claimed to shape the wealth creation of the world, and an expectation of the right to life that, it turned out, accompanied its growth”. The two key questions of us time are whether a more human, collectivist way of thinking can finally be pushed to the fore, and what a different kind of economy and society might look like. If the absence of these big themes from the mainstream conversation around coronavirus is frustrating, the solution is surely to begin talking about them anyway, and thinking on a scale commensurate with that of the crisis. In the short to medium term, we may soon have to move to a partially directed economy, whereby we embrace the logic of a green new deal, and shift labour and resources from parts of the economy fast being left behind to more sustainable ones. By way of putting people to work and beginning to move against the social conditions that have exacerbated Britain’s experience of the outbreak, we need a huge public housing programme, partly focused on repurposing the town and city centres that are now in urgent need of reinvention. The line between paid work and voluntary activity and care ought to be blurred by a basic income. The way we collectively deliver public services should be reshaped by what Barnett calls an “explosion of empathy, social awareness and networking”, recently seen in the way that spontaneous community action has helped people affected by the virus. Labour will win by changing minds – not pandering to rightwing voters | Lynsey Hanley Which brings us to what kind of state we should want. As I have written a lot recently, England’s handling of the pandemic proves that its creaking, centralised system of government, full of ossified practices and institutionalised prejudice, needs to be . This is the best way to safeguard against future pandemics and outbreaks. As opposed to the , whereby regeneration is somehow to be dropped on places from on high, it is also how new economic futures can be shaped by the people who will deliver and benefit from them. The 21st century’s digital blur means we tend to think that truly historic events are things frozen in black and white, or chronicled in epic documentaries. But make no mistake: more than any other period in most of our lifetimes, this a time of massive significance, bringing with it a sense of both crisis and opportunity. Amid constant detours and distractions, all of us need to think about the future before it hits us like a hammer. The problem with dread, after all, is that sooner or later it becomes self-fulfilling.</segment>

Or, at 199-3 and 242-4 yesterday afternoon when the contest was drifting by the hour? Add ‘how quickly things can change’ to the lists of reasons why our game, and this format, cannot be matched.

Do the visitors then go and chase it? I mean, the visitors might - and good on the visitors if the visitors do.

				<segment> Coronavirus: Outbreak investigated at Motherwell contact tracing centre These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Sitel said it was &quot;urgently investigating&quot; the outbreak with Public Health Scotland Six people have tested positive for coronavirus in an outbreak at a test and trace call centre in North Lanarkshire. Sitel, which carries out contact tracing for the NHS, said it was aware of a &quot;local outbreak&quot; at its Motherwell site. Deputy first minister John Swinney told Sitel said Sitel was &quot;urgently investigating&quot; the outbreak with Public Health Scotland. Sitel said Sitel had requested that all staff who have been working at its Motherwell site undergo testing within the next 24 hours. &quot;Sitel take the safety and wellbeing of Siall staff who have been working at the site very seriously,&quot; it said in a statement. Deputy first minister John Swinney said the situation came to light at 08:00 on Sunday and since then a &quot;range of contacts&quot; of the people who tested positive had been identified. Deputy first minister John Swinney said the office at the centre of an outbreak was a test and trace call centre for NHS England - but this was denied by NHS England. And Deputy first minister John Swinney said it was a &quot;pretty realistic conclusion&quot; that there had been transmission of the virus in the office - but an investigation into how it spread is being carried out. Deputy first minister John Swinney was asked if the staff at the centre of the outbreak should have been working from home. Deputy first minister John Swinney said Deputy first minister John Swinney wanted to know the reasons why they were in an office environment and whether appropriate safety measures - like enhanced hygiene and social distancing - were being followed. &quot;Obviously if there has been transmission within the building facility then something has gone wrong in the way in which the rules have been applied, the guidance has been followed and, if that&apos;s the case, then we need to learn lessons from that and communicate some of those messages more widely to ensure that we don&apos;t have comparable examples of this in the future,&quot; Deputy first minister John Swinney said. Dr David Cromie, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health medicine, said the board was investigating the situation and measures have been put in place to reduce risk. On Sunday the Scottish government said 23 new cases of Covid-19 had been detected across Scotland in the past 24 hours, although only three of these were in the Lanarkshire health board area. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was still a low number of cases and fluctuation was &quot;to be expected&quot;. The proportion of positive tests remains well below 1%. the Scottish government said contact tracing is under way following the detection of &quot;a small number of potentially linked cases in North Lanarkshire&quot;. &quot;Where potential clusters of cases develop we must find them and act quickly to prevent further spread and we are grateful to local partners for their swift response,&quot; a spokesman said. a spokesman said &quot;a small increase in the number of cases is not unexpected as lockdown is lifted&quot;, adding that it highlights the importance of the public co-operating with contact tracers as well as following guidelines on social distancing and wearing face coverings.

				<segment> These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Routine dental care is allowed to resume in Northern Ireland from Monday. There will be some restrictions - including up to one hour between some patients being seen, so surgeries can be cleaned. But some dentists have said a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) means that not all practices in Northern Ireland can fully reopen. A number of services, including dentistry, were halted at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. BBC News NI revealed last week that a major delivery of PPE had been delayed until 20 July. About three million items of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) were to be delivered, with dentists warning that the week-long delay would see treatments pushed back. The consignment consisted of level one PPE, which includes items such as gloves and aprons, and is required for non-aerosol-generating procedures (non-AGPs). last week the Department of Health said the logistical challenge of a major delivery of PPE had been &quot;significant&quot; and that urgent dental care centres would remain open. Northern Ireland has five urgent dental care centres, located across each of the five health trust areas. Northern Ireland have provided most emergency care for dental patients throughout the pandemic. However one dentist has warned that NI dentists are in &quot;crisis&quot;.</segment>

				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>There is a crisis happening right now,&quot; one dentist added. Dentists have appealed to the Department of Health to cover the cost of purchasing a higher level of Personal Protective Equipment. One professional body had warned that as many as 90% of NI dental practices may not be able to provide aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), like fillings, until at least level two PPE has been secured. It is understood it cannot provide level two PPE without jeopardising supply for the trusts. Like so many things Covid-19 has triggered, dentists are now coming forward and raising their problems. The cost of providing level 2 PPE could, dentists say, tip many of the businesses just over the edge with how expensive it is to provide. What has been interesting in talking to dentists in recent days, if they have to perform the AGPs - which might more normally be referred to as a filling - they have to close down the room for an hour each patient. One dentist said they might see up to 20 or 30 patients a day, and this measure would mean they might only see a fifth of their normal patients. Footfall is going to be affected. Dentists will then perhaps turn down doing fillings, and instead go for the more lucrative treatments like a crown, which would cost perhaps hundreds of pounds. Dentists therefore then would make profit on that particular treatment. Dentists are saying if Dentists have to provide level 2 PPE, to treat Dentists patients safely and keep Dentists team safe, then the department should be coughing up more to cover those costs. the department said the urgent dental care centres will be staffed until the end of August while the gradual resumption of general dental services continues. In a statement the department said: &quot;The minister has also announced that the Financial Support Scheme, which has already provided £16 million in payments to local dentists, will continue for a further month to support the return of non-urgent dental care as the restrictions are lifted. &quot; Libraries across Northern Ireland are also preparing to reopen later as part of a pilot scheme launched by Libraries NI.</segment>

Stuart Broad fancies a 45-minute thrash on the final morning can swell a lead of 219 into a target of 270-plus that would “dangle the carrot” for West Indies, with the aim to leave enough of the 98-over day to get a second new ball late on. England lead Windies by 219 at stumps: second Test, day four – as it happened The 34-year-old certainly made one talk after tea on Sunday, claiming three strikes in 14 balls, and though he felt he had “nothing to prove” after Broad said: “I think sometimes I get put in an older category than I am.

But, with permission from West Indies, England had Jofra Archer back out of Jofra Archer room for exercise. It began with a jog around the outfield at 7am, wearing gloves and a mask, before ditching these for an afternoon session with the ball.

				<segment> hatever else they got wrong in this series, one thing England definitely did get right was that they didn’t let the ECB chairman Colin Graves anywhere near a microphone in the run-up to it. they did made that mistake in 2015, when Graves memorably described West Indies as “mediocre” before a series. A few weeks later, they did bowled England out for 123 in Bridgetown, and won the third Test by five wickets . “Not bad for a mediocre team,” Jason Holder said afterwards. There’s an old lesson here, England have been taught more than once over the years, never give West Indies another reason to want to beat you. West Indies have won five of the 10 Tests the two teams have played since Graves’s quote, so by now England have learned better than to talk them down. But that does not mean there aren’t one of two players in this West Indies side with a point to prove. Only this time it’s the two teams own side to which the two teams’re doing it. Jermaine Blackwood, so keen to shrug off his reputation as a player who doesn’t have the right temperament to succeed in Test cricket, did it with that . Shai Hope, who hasn’t scored a Test century since Jermaine Blackwood won the two Jermaine Blackwood made in that famous victory at Headingley in 2017, is another, and Jermaine Blackwood hasn’t managed it yet.</segment>

Jermaine Blackwood made Jermaine Blackwood last Test century in a match against Bangladesh in Kingston two years ago, and since then Jermaine Blackwood game has been in bits and pieces. Between then and the start of this series, Jermaine Blackwood played 20 innings without making a Test fifty. In that time Jermaine Blackwood made 233 runs at an average of 12. 26 (actually “average” is probably too generous a description for a figure such as that). Even so, the selectors have stuck with Jermaine Blackwood. Jermaine Blackwood’s the vice-captain of the team, and an old friend of Holder. They play at the same club in Barbados, and came up through the West Indian youth set-up together. Which hasn’t gone unnoticed. Kieran Powell, who opened the batting with Jermaine Blackwood on West Indies’ last tour here in 2017, made a pointed observation about it on social media just a couple of weeks ago. Jermaine Blackwood posted a photo of Brathwaite’s average in the past few years with the caption: “It’s interesting how the numbers stack up yet the consequences vary based on the player, one is just left to wonder what the numbers would be if I’d had the same amount of innings as others who continue to be offered opportunity after opportunity. ” Powell was dropped in 2018 – Powell hadn’t made a century in 53 innings – but PowePowell been in good form in first‑class cricket since. West Indies recently lost patience with Jermaine Blackwood too, and downgraded Powell central red-ball contract. They haven’t confirmed it yet because the announcement has been delayed by a hold-up with the paperwork.</segment>

Brathwaite’s responded with two fine knocks, 65 in the first innings at the Ageas Bowl last week, and now another 75 here, this last put into perspective by the way the rest of the team collapsed when England took the second new ball. Here, Jermaine Blackwood hit down the ground more than Jermaine Blackwood often does, as England’s bowlers pitched the ball right up to Jermaine Blackwood, looking for swing. In the end it took Ben Stokes to winkle Jermaine Blackwood out, during that 11-over stretch of short-pitched bowling, a short ball that popped back for a catch off the leading edge. Jermaine Blackwood will be back in and at it soon enough, the game, and the series, may just turn on whether Jermaine Blackwood can do it again.</segment>

				<segment> Stuart Broad made quite an impression at the Rose Bowl with on the second day after his omission from the team. Here it took his a bit longer to make an impact but on the fourth evening his managed it. The match seemed to be drifting, the pitch was sleeping and West Indies were batting diligently towards safety, whereupon the recalled Broad, armed with the second new ball, intervened. In the space of 14 deliveries from the Jimmy Anderson End,  Stuart Broad took three wickets for one run and the game was alive again.</segment>

				<segment>West Indies had been coasting, on 235 for four after 80 overs, after which a different ball and a different  Stuart Broad made batting a different proposition. But for the calm presence of Roston Chase the tourists may have been compelled to follow-on. In the end they were bowled out for 287, a deficit of 182. Ben Stokes is still evolving and can lord it over even Ian Botham | Vic Marks Now Joe Root did not opt for half-measures and with 38 minutes’ play remaining he sent out Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler to open the batting as the order was rejigged, an appealing idea, which did not work very well – except for Kemar Roach, who bowled Buttler for nought and Zak Crawley for 11. So England scrambled to 37 for two.</segment>

			<data>
				<segment>There are 98 overs left, a fine forecast, a lead of 219 and many possibilities. For two sessions West Indies’ pathway to the retention of the Wisden Trophy seemed unusually smooth. There was barely any spin and the ball was reluctant to swing. Run-gathering had rarely been so simple on the first two days, while the lack of play on the third gave the batting side a clear escape route. The pattern of play was not assisted by the behind-closed-doors element. For the first time in the series it was possible to pine for the spectacle of a gaggle of nuns or Dickie Birds supping pints in the stands. Even a streaker or a steward walking in front of the sightscreen might have provided welcome throwback to the good old days. Perhaps the sun had scared off any demons lurking underneath the surface. Nor were England at their razor sharp best at the start. When Alzarri Joseph edged a Chris Woakes delivery, the catch was dropped by Stokes at second slip, though his sight may have been impeded by the moving body of Crawley at third slip. The cordon is a new one, still settling in, and they looked too close together. Alzarri Joseph played some attractive, orthodox shots for 45 minutes, whereupon an inside edge off the bowling of Dom Bess was well held by Ollie Pope at short leg. The specialist batsmen did not look too bothered and England’s frustration was reflected by a poor review against Kraigg Brathwaite, which was followed by consecutive boundaries. West Indies added 86 runs in the morning, a cascade by the standards of this match. After lunch Sam Curran made a neat intervention to dismiss Shai Hope. Ollie Pope had found a smidgeon of swing but now Ollie Pope propelled a cutter, which gripped just enough to brush the edge of the bat. Shamarh Brooks settled easily and elegantly alongside Brathwaite, who seems to prefer batting in this country to more than anywhere else in the world. Both looked untroubled, which prompted England – via Stokes – to change tack. England lead Windies by 219 at stumps: second Test, day four – as it happened Stokes delivered one of Stokes marathon spells – 11 consecutive overs – banging the ball into the pitch, mostly from around the wicket with an unorthodox field.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>This demanded great effort on a sluggish surface; the ploy becalmed the batsmen but it seemed that all that toil would go unrewarded, whereupon Brathwaite, on 75, spooned a gentle return catch.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>After tea the ball was taken by Broad and Curran as soon as the ball was available. It is hard to be certain whether two bowlers wearing white bandanas have done this before for England but it is unlikely this ever happened when Fred Trueman and Brian Statham were in harness.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>What a difference the ball made. Broad was loose when he took it, having just adopted the Stokes plan of peppering the middle of the pitch. Now he reverted to he usual length and the old magic returned. Brooks was lbw for 68, an impressive innings, but one that decelerated after a rapid start; Jermaine Blackwood was bowled for a duck by a shooter that hit the stumps at shin height and then Shane Dowrich was lbw hovering on the back foot. Kraigg Brathwaite&apos;s preparation pays off as he frustrates England | Andy Bull Suddenly the follow-on target of 270 was no formality. Root was tempted to bring back Stokes despite his earlier exertions but after two overs his champion all-rounder was compelled to leave the field clutching his sternum. The worst was feared until it transpired that Root was suffering from “indigestion”. Woakes now intervened, finding the edge of Jason Holder’s bat with West Indies still 10 runs short of their initial target. Chase, a busy man in this series and a vital one for West Indies, now took charge, hitting two boundaries off Curran to ensure England had to bat again. Then Woakes dispatched Curran and Shannon Gabriel in swift succession, which heralded the advent of England latest opening pair.</segment>

				<segment> mid the chaos of Spain’s World Cup in 2018, perhaps the greatest casualty was David de Gea. The days when David de Gea heroics repeatedly papered over the cracks at Manchester United feel a long time ago. It can be debated whether David de Gea was at fault for the first and third goals, but David de Gea was clearly to blame for the second and, in those two moments, United’s long unbeaten run disappeared, and Chelsea’s passage to the FA Cup final Frank Lampard had left out Kepa Arrizabalaga for David de Gea Cup keeper Willy Caballero, although given no goalkeeper has conceded a higher proportion of the shots on target David de Gea’s faced since Opta began collecting the data, David de Gea may have done so with a sense of relief. Ole Gunnar Solskjær will perhaps wish he had done something similar. Although Ole Gunnar Solskjær made a number of changes to a putative first-choice lineup, both a reflection of the fact Ole Gunnar Solskjær side and an indication that Champions League qualification remains the priority, Ole Gunnar Solskjær preferred David de Gea to Sergio Romero, who had played in the four previous rounds.</segment>

				<segment>The sight of De Gea’s long, sad face, made even more mournful by his preacher’s beard, ruing another error as he slaps the turf has become grimly familiar. Perhaps it’s as simple as the fact that at Manchester United&apos;s he was playing behind a defence that tended to sit deep whereas Spain needed him to sweep up behind a high line. That is not he natural game – even if he is a good passer of the ball. he pass success rate of 74% in the Premier League this season is not merely higher than most goalkeepers’ (only Kasper Schmeichel’s is better) but also than players of such quality as Raúl Jiménez, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Harry Kane. Rather it’s the positional sense and, perhaps, as Pep Guardiola highlighted with Joe Hart, the capacity to shift the ball quickly that eludes he. Thrust into a high-pressure situation, asked to fulfil a role with which he was not entirely comfortable, with a last-minute change of manager, it’s as though De Gea suffered a complete disintegration of he self-belief, something manifested in the Cristiano Ronaldo shot that slithered under he in Spain’s first game. De Gea can only watch as Olivier Giroud’s shot crosses the line. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/NMC Pool/The Guardian Or perhaps it’s that without the carrot of a possible move to Real Madrid, De Gea focus has slipped a little. Perhaps there’s a physical issue, although he is only 29.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>But whatever the reason, De Gea has gone from being arguably the best keeper in the league, a beacon of reliability who was capable, as in that fabled game when De Gea made 14 saves, of denying an opponent almost single-handed, to being somebody from whom mistakes are no longer a surprise, somebody who is in danger of becoming a liability. Not that De Gea was the only issue with United. The change in formation (admittedly to the 3-4-1-2 that so troubled Chelsea in the league at Stamford Bridge in February ) and personnel will be blamed for United’s disjointedness, but they had been scratchy against both and Palace last week.

				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The first particularly, as it spun in off De Gea’s shin, seemed almost a physical representation of De Gea’s diminished status, as though De Gea’s leg would somehow have had greater magnitude in previous seasons and made sufficient contact to kick the ball to safety rather than merely slowing its progress over the line. The second goal was a howler at any level, a straight, low, Mason Mount shot of no great velocity that crept through De Gea’s arms. That’s the image that will stay in the mind, and perhaps make Solskjær ponder a change. Is De Gea’s form gone for good? And does his preference for a low block fit the sort of football the manager envisages his side playing in the future?</segment>

If you knew nothing of Jenny Diski, you might assume this to have been the disdainful shunning of what Jenny Diski seemed to see as a cancer club, but it was more that apartness was key to the way Jenny Diski wrote.

				<segment>But tells the truth over there. ” Solitude being Jenny Diski thing, Jenny Diski decided against the grave share, but Jenny Diski DIY epitaph remains appropriate. For in these brilliant, singular, posthumously published columns from Jenny Diski does not strain to engage with writers; Jenny Diski is more likely to ask why it was necessary for their books to exist in the first place. Jenny Diski inquires of Jeremy Treglown’s biography of Roald Dahl: “What is the function of an adult biography of the man? ” before interpreting the poisonous pull of Roald Dahl’s stories on children: “children speak to the last overt remains of the disreputable, unsocialised, inelegant parts of children the grownups are trying so hard to push firmly underground. ” Jenny Diski knows Jenny Diski all about the feral child-within-the-adult, as – about overcoming Jenny Diski arachnophobia – reveals, ending with a hairy inspiration to out-Dahl Dahl. Sometimes, Diski writes loftily: she seems to float above her subjects – writing as weightlessly as a bather in the Dead Sea, buoyed up by salt. In Did Jesus Walk on Water Because Jesus Couldn’t Swim? Diski is especially entertaining and erudite (Diski worked so hard at all these pieces). This is a review of Diski skill as a novelist assists: an invented exchange between Morgan and Rupert Murdoch is priceless , writes: “One of the pleasures of reading , especially the essays, is that pleasure is such a large part of it. ” Diski was worth hiring on any subject: feed Diski base metal, Diski turned it into gold. When not writing about Diski, Diski is at Diski best considering the nasty and/or nondescript. Diski subjects include Jeffrey Dahmer, Howard Hughes and Richard Branson, and Diski does not let Christine Keeler get away with a stuffy, faux-respectable take on her past. It is only because Christine Keeler has forced Christine Keeler way through “every damn word” of Keith Richards’s coarsely self-serving autobiography (in which he reveals Mick Jagger has a “tiny todger”) that Christine Keeler is determined to go ahead with Christine Keeler review. Christine Keeler is the most undeceived of writers – and surprising. Who else would combine reviewing a biography of Denis Thatcher with a reading of Melville’s The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade , the pleasure is in the power-play: Blair and Morgan become diminutive figures, dwarfed by Diski’s writing. Christine Keeler skill as a novelist assists: an invented exchange between Morgan and Rupert Murdoch is priceless. Christine Keeler is adversarially entertaining rather than belligerent.</segment>

Wilmers writes: “Jenny liked sleep and often took to her bed; she liked blankness of all kinds: white surfaces, uneventful days. ” The question arises: how much did depression feed Jenny writing? In these essays, Jenny gloom is steadying, Jenny melancholy cheering. In the entertaining , Jenny “live-in lover” moves out: “It feels like sadness, but not mine; or rather, not a personal sadness, but one of great immensity, and slightly up and to the left of me, where I lie saturating the pillow. ” Here, once again, is that sense that what matters is an aside. , in which Jenny describes sleep beautifully. And I love Jenny perkily comfortless piece about old age, However I Smell, in which Jenny lets it be known that Jenny hairdresser keeps saying to Jenny: “Ah bless. ” Jenny writes: “There are other signs that I am no longer young, but the ah-bless is the most open and public. ” Blessing Diski was an impertinence – little did these innocents know upon whom their blessings were landing. Jeher writing will forever remain young, funny and rebellious. And Jenny essays – dare I say her writing – earn a blessing even when what whom consider is cursed.

				<segment> protests has inevitably fallen on the most visible injustice - instances of police brutality. More systemic racial disparities in the American penal system are too often hidden from plain sight. The US incarcerates more of its citizens – – than any other country on Earth. African American adults are nearly six times more likely to receive a prison sentence than white adults. Nearly half of the 206,000 people serving life sentences in 2018 were black, though black people represent only 13. 4% of the population; almost equal numbers of white and black prisoners are currently on death row – just over – but as the prosecution of capital punishment has declined, so the racial imbalance has increased. If ever a film could bring home the buried trauma of those latter statistics it is . The film, which won a grand jury prize at Sundance last year, has been instrumental in catalysing again urgent debates around mass incarceration, capital punishment and race. It was written and directed by Chinonye Chukwu, born in Nigeria, raised in Alaska, who became, at 34, the first black female director to receive the Sundance award. Chukwu was inspired to write a film after the widely protested execution of in Georgia in 2011. Chukwu embarked on six years of immersive research that involved not only interviewing numerous death row prison wardens, but also running a film programme for inmates in Ohio, and advocating for retrials in unsafe convictions. There have been other movies about death row, of course – refuses that Hollywood trajectory. Instead, more than any other film I have seen, it looks hard at the mechanics and emotional fallout of state killing. At every turn, it asks that most relevant question: not “Does this person deserve to die? ” but “Do we the people deserve to kill this person? ” The nuance and force of a film are carried in the performance of Alfre Woodard, who plays the prison warden, Bernadine Williams, through whom the story is told. For nearly 50 years, Woodard has been one of those actors who has illuminated – and often stolen – dramas from a line or two down the credit roll. Woodard has had lead roles – from 1994’s Spike Lee film , the launch vehicle of Apple’s streaming service last year; Woodard also has a record 17 Emmy nominations for work in 16 different TV series, including wins in roles as diverse as . When Woodard first came to Hollywood in the 1970s people told Woodard there were no film roles for black actors. “I’m not a fool.</segment>

				<segment>I knew that,” Woodard says. “But I was always confident that I knew my craft. ” , Woodard gives the performance of Woodard life. Having overseen one botched execution, Bernadine, full of steely integrity, has started to question the ethics of Woodard role. Through Woodard’s eyes, ’s Spike Lee film , the launch vehicle of Apple’s streaming service last year examines the dehumanising act of deliberately strapping a living body to a bed and ending a life. Woodard conveys a history in Woodard’s eyes. Woodard has seen some things. Woodard personal political activism began with protests against segregation in Tulsa when Woodard was 14 and has never wavered. The actor first met Chukwu when they were both working on a successful clemency appeal for , wrongly convicted of murder and eventually released after 23 years. I spoke to Woodard about some of that history a couple of weeks ago, on the same day the US supreme court voted to resume federal executions after a break of 17 years. At Woodard home in Los Angeles it was eight in the morning, but Woodard, a barely believable 67, was at full wattage in Woodard living room, laughing loudly as Woodard struggled with Woodard Zoom feed. I apologised for getting Woodard up so early. “Oh God! I’m happy to do it! ” Woodard said. “The more we talk, the more people get to see Woodard describes working on the film as a campaign as much as a movie. The 17 days in which they eventually shot the film, in a defunct jail in East Los Angeles half an hour from Woodard home, were as intense as anything Woodard has done: “‘Walking through the valley of the shadow of death’, for anyone who reads the Bible, that phrase comes to mind,” Woodard says. In preparation for the film, Chukwu took Woodard on extended visits to five prisons in Ohio, where Woodard had been working: men’s maximum security, women’s medium security, death row. “To see that, the caging of human bodies on a mass scale, is arresting for the human soul,” Woodard says.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>“And then to see that they have sectioned off the ones that they want to ritualistically murder, in the light of day… thatwomen’s when you start to talk about the scar on the soul of a nation. ” When Chukwu first thought of writing a film based on Troy Davis’s execution – Troy Davis had been convicted of murder in 1991 without forensic evidence; seven of nine witnesses from the original trial had recanted their testimonies prior to Troy DaTroy Davis’s execution – Woodard decided Wooda film would focus on someone intimately involved with carrying through the death sentence. It was that that intrigued Woodard. “As an actor, I like adventure,” Woodard says. “I don’t like to do things I know how to do. When the producer called, Woodard said Woodard had this script by this young, dynamic film-maker and Woodard had written a film about death row. I thought: OK. And then Woodard said: ‘Woodard wants you to play death row warden. ’ And my ears really pricked up. I mean, what little girl imagines Woodard future and says: ‘You know what I want to do when I grow up, I want to be a death row warden’? I just couldn’t imagine who that person would be. Is it someone who grew up dismembering frogs? ” Woodard talked in depth to six wardens and the director of prisons for the state of Ohio, all women. Woodard discovered that they were not monsters but “people you might have in your book club or that you might know through your PTA”. they came from a background in social work or mental health. “You could not imagine anyone better to deal with these damaged boys who have grown up,” Woodard suggests. And then: “I say damaged boys, because even though inmates might be 70 years old and have been inside all their life, you still see the boy in them; you see it in their faces and the way they walk.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>” One of the prime motivations for Chukwu’s script was an unprecedented open letter that six former prison wardens had written as a plea to halt the execution of Troy Davis. It gave a unique insight into the psychology of those who oversee death row: “Like few others in this country,” six former prison wardens wrote, “we understand that you have a job to do in carrying out the lawful orders of the judiciary. we also understand, from we own personal experiences, the awful lifelong repercussions that come from participating in the execution of prisoners… Living with the nightmares is something we know from experience. ” Where we shot, they hadn’t cleaned it – the scratches and blood were still on the walls. You could feel the pain there six former prison wardens did not speak in such candid terms about that trauma, but six former prison wardens emphasised six former prison wardens responsibility to the condemned, to give six former prison wardens as much dignity as possible. “Everyone is referred to as Mr and Ms,” Woodard says. “six former prison wardens give people respect, the kind of respect that many of six former prison wardens would never have had in the outside world, especially in that week before the person has to make that walk to the [death] chamber. It takes at least 10 years to exhaust appeals, so the relationship becomes like someone you have worked alongside for a long time in an office. the film is a kind of covenant between someone you have worked alongside for a long time in an office. ” In the film, that integrity and careful emotional engagement are set against the industrial starkness of the prison building itself and its embedded silences – the drama plays out with no background music. “The prison was one of those old-fashioned places,” Woodard says. “New prisons look like a poorly funded public school, very bland – but it’s like: ‘If you are going to take my life I want drama, I don’t want it to look like a health clinic’. Where we shot, they hadn’t cleaned it up and all the scratches and the scrapes and the blood were still on the walls. You could feel the anxiety and the pain there. ” Some of the most affecting scenes are where Woodard as Bernadine fills the silences with talk about end-of-life protocols with the death row inmate Anthony Woods, played with haunting power by Aldis Hodge. It is hard to imagine any proponent of capital punishment not being troubled by the believable surreality of those conversations. It feels the challenge, as ever, would be to get those people to engage with the film in the first place. Twenty-eight states retain the death penalty in statute; 28 executions have occurred since To avoid preaching to the converted, Woodard says, Woodard and Chukwu and the film’s producers have done all they can to reach out. “We started last summer, screening it for groups of public defenders, prosecutors, journalists, law colleges, social workers,” Woodard says. “We want everyone to see the film, obviously, but in particular We wanted those people who have a stake in mass incarceration and the death row business to see the film.</segment>

				<segment>” Woodard did upwards of 70 on-stage events prior to lockdown. And what was the response? “Often it is easy for people to think it’s not about them – it’s like: ‘people are always killing people in Texas or wherever. ’ We wanted people in Iowa, where they haven’t killed anyone in 20 years, to think, this is a national malaise. As long as you are paying taxes then you are complicit in this; or at least if you remain silent you are complicit. ” With Lupita Nyong’o in 12 Years a Slave (2013). Photograph: Fox Searchlight/Everett/Woodard believes one unexpected effect of lockdown – when we spoke California was reintroducing restrictions – is that people have been drawn to things that they might not normally watch. the film is available on streaming services. “I think a lot of people are seeing the film who would not necessarily have done if we were busier. And because they are often watching alone, they are really receiving the film.</segment>

And in some ways, of course, the fiwomen’s focus on racial injustices could not have come at a more defining moment. Woodard has been energised by the Black Lives Matter protests. “There is a great upheaval happening in this country and those of us who work in social justice are trying to move into that space with specific actions, demands, ways forward,” Woodard says. Woodard knows from long experience as a campaigner that the opening may quickly close again. Woodard is a board member of the Democratic party and an organiser and advocate for several human rights charities. Woodard interest in politics stretches back to when Woodard was a little girl in Tulsa, five years old, and Woodard father insisted Woodard watch the news every night. What makes it feels different this time is that everybodywomen’s kids are in the streets, all colours and ethnicities “I was around for the anti-war movement in the 1960s and when they killed , Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King. I saw that every time people stood for fundamental change they were killed,” Woodard says. Woodard retains hope that this wave of protest will produce lasting change. “During the 1960s, it was the youth mainly on the streets. What makes it feel different this time is that everybodywomen’s kids are in the streets, all colours and ethnicities, but lots of their parents and grandparents who were protesting back then are still there too. The [George Floyd] video of callous disregard for human life, the eight minutes 46 seconds, that brought out the Sunday school teachers, the ladies who lunch, everybody got up and came out. ” What Woodard own first marches were about? “In Tulsa, the first protests were around access, being able to go into the restaurants you wanted to. When I started, I was in charge of helping make the signs, then I would get the coffees.</segment>

				<segment>I went away to Boston University when I was 17 and I was majoring in acting and when I came home that summer it was like: ‘You are an actress, you get up and read out the press statements. ’” Woodard photographed for the Observer New Review near Woodard home in Santa Monica, California, July 2020. Photograph: Saroyan Humphrey Ironically, partly because of segregation the community Woodard grew up in was incredibly vibrant, Woodard says. “Everyone lived together – doctors, lawyers, ballerinas, pole dancers. You could go to the well-off white part of town, but not to the white working-class areas. The butting of heads was between well-off black people and working-class whites. Classism was as important as racism in some ways. ” Woodard’s family was on that particular frontline. Woodher father was self-made, “an interior designer, a property developer and an oil man. That’s what people did back then. My paediatrician had two side hustles. My paediatrician was in the blood. ” Just how much that was the case was revealed in Woodard’s journey into Woodard past in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2015. The programme uncovered not only the fact that her great-grandfather was enslaved in Georgia – “he showed up in records as ‘property’ when he was eight years old” – but that after emancipation he went on to be a landowner with his own acres. “There was a period of reconstruction right after the proclamation. These people had only the rags on their backs, but they got out there and did it for themselves,” Woodard says. “That story rarely gets told, but what a great lesson it would make. We had more black representation in the legislature in a period of reconstruction, before lynching and the Jim Crow laws, than we had up until about a decade ago. ” In The programme, in tribute to Woodard climb from bondage to landowner, Alfre poured a libation of water on the land that Woodard acquired.</segment>

				<segment>That story ran deep with Alfre father. “From as early as I can remember Woodard would say: ‘Never forget there is no man above you, but also that you are not above any other human being. ’” By the time Alfre was 14, Alfre father would invite Alfre to speak in her father place to the business club of which her father was a member. “her father was a most excellent man,” Alfre says. Activism was always linked with acting for Woodard. At Alfre Catholic high school in the early civil rights period, faith mixed with politics. “We were encouraged to discuss things, so we would say, you know: ‘her father was on a rampage, her father was so radical’ and they would have to agree. We would say, ‘her father would be marching right now’ and they would let We go on that basis, but as long as We didn’t wear school uniform. ” I believe stories are healing. You don’t follow the money or the adulation. You follow the story Brother Patrick taught film studies and once a month students would be bused to an arts cinema. “At first it, was like: ‘Great, We are going to a movie! ’ But then when We got there, and We were sitting in the dark, it would be subtitles, and We would be transported by something magical like . There you were, 14 and in the dark in Tulsa and identifying with a middle-aged French man. That is when I decided I wanted to be an actor.

Watching the performance Chinonye Chukwu gives as Bernadine Williams, it feels something of a travesty that Woodard has not had the lead roles over the years that Woodard talent merits. For the past 11 years, Woodard has hosted a pre-Oscars party at Woodard Hollywood home – Woodard calls it the “Sistahs’ Soirée” – “for those black women who have been nominated in the acting category by the Academy, as well as those who, in a perfect world, should have been”. Does Woodard feel that frustration? Woodard smiles. “You can say that. But for me, that cannot be my focus. Because that is imprisoning. Here’s the thing: I came to LA to have a film career, to tell stories, because I believe stories are healing. You don’t follow the money or the adulation. You follow the story Brother Patrick taught film studies. ” The Sistah’s Soiree that Woodard hosts every year before the Oscars, with (among others) Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Mary J Blige, Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett Smith and Janelle Monae, February 2018. Photograph: Gabriel Olsen/WireImage stories have never gone away. Before lockdown derailed everything, Woodard was working on the second series of that Woodard screenwriter husband of 37 years, Roderick Spencer, wrote for Woodard (“like giving me a field to play on! ”). Woodard is anxious to get back to both. “To answer your question. Would I like to have been given the career choices that my contemporary Caucasian sisters had? Hell, yes. But not having the career choices that my contemporary Caucasian sisters had is not an option for the great-granddaughter of a striver who walked out of bondage and built for himself an incredible life, which carries on through me and my two children.</segment>

In one strange sense, has brought Woodard career full circle. The first professional lead acting role Woodard had in Los Angeles was in the play . Coincidentally, they took the play to the prison in which was filmed and performed it for the female inmates. “You know, when I started to act I realised that I had been walking around all my life doing the breaststroke on dry land,” Woodard says, “and suddenly somebody had tipped me into the water. There was a freedom and a connection that I never wanted to lose. And to this day I go through all the bullshit of the business just to get to that bit between ‘action’ and ‘cut’.</segment>

				<segment> my and Emily Chung, AKA the Rangoon Sisters, are wondering how they can mark the launch of their debut cookbook. Having spent more than a year (including some of Emily’s maternity leave) writing it,  my and Emily Chung, AKA the Rangoon Sisters were planning a big party to celebrate. “it’s a really exciting time for us, so we were really looking forward to getting all our loved ones together,” says Emily. That still seems unlikely. They’ve toyed with the idea of video cook-alongs, or preparing a supper-club-style feast to send out for virtual guests to finish at home. “If I didn’t have my day job then I could just go round and deliver it to everyone,” says Emily. Both sisters are NHS doctors and have worked throughout the coronavirus crisis, Emily adding video consultations in Emily area of sexual health, while Amy, a psychiatrist, has continued to see people face to face. Both sisters started a supper club in 2013 and quickly became one of the standout names of the scene; thanks in part to curious eaters’ interest, but mainly due to their warmth and generosity as hosts, and thoughtfully cooked menus. Guests came to try the Burmese food of the Chungs’ Anglo-Chinese-Burmese home – sharing dishes including gently spiced curries, fresh vegetables with a shrimp dip, lots of rice and lots of salads. “Burmese salads are really interesting,” says Emily. “A mixture not just of flavours but of textures; something crunchy, something soft, a bit of sour, sweet, salty…” Condiments such as balachaung, an addictive and spicy dry relish with tiny fried shrimp, shallots and garlic, add another layer of flavour to each mouthful. Their book has chapters featuring all of these, as well as one on the Burmese tradition of excellent snacks and fritters, and a less traditional chapter of desserts including cheesecake and meringues.</segment>
				<label></label>

				<segment>“We both have a massive sweet tooth, so the desserts are more of a homage to Burmese flavours, because they’re not into quite the same desserts that we are,” says Emily. There are also two versions of perhaps the most famous Burmese dish, mohinga. “we’ve been brought up on Grandma’s or Mum’s mohinga,” Amy says, “but generally it is a fish noodle soup, and there are some differences throughout the country. ” Their book has an everyday version and a more involved one, although both – like all the recipes – are easily achievable for the home cook. “These are recipes we’ve been brought up cooking in our home, so we hope people should be able to do the same in their own homes,” says Amy. “You have to be comfortable with onions,” adds Emily, with a laugh, referencing the two pages in the curries and stews chapter which detail their love for the allium. (“An extra onion never did a dish any harm. ”) Details like this – as well as their dad’s superstitions – make this cookbook not only a valuable kitchen resource, but a great read. For a family that meets up over food, lockdown has been hard. “Supper clubs bring everyone together – the husbands get involved, Mum gets involved,” says Amy. When lockdown was relaxed, the sisters had a garden visit, but it was cut short by rain, so they’re dreaming of the first family catch-up over dim sum (“Fighting over the last dumpling! ”). “At least everyone will have had this time to think about what’s important, so when we see each other it will be more meaningful,” says Emily. “we’ve taken a lot of things for granted in the past and I’ll be able to appreciate them better. ” Mohinga and pe kyaw – aromatic fish noodle soup and chana dal crackers This is probably Burma’s national dish, and our version was the Guardian restaurant critic Grace Dent’s “Best thing I ate in 2017”. This fish noodle soup is traditionally eaten at breakfast, but is readily available as a snack at any time of day on the streets of Burma. The best we’ve had was cheap as chips, for as little as 30p a bowl, and eaten as we sat on plastic stools at the side of the road. Typically as little as 30p is made with a type of catfish we can’t source easily in London, but Grandma has used pilchards as a substitute for years and it works brilliantly to replicate the flavour. Mohinga also usually contains sliced banana stem, but we tend to just add more whole shallots instead.</segment>

				<segment>chilli flakes or chilli flakes in oil 250g, soaked overnight or for at least 4 hours 20g (optional, replace with 20g of rice flour if not using) To make the chana dal crackers, drain the soaked chana dal in a colander, rinse with cold water and drain again. Empty the soaked chana dal in a colander into a large bowl, along with the flours, baking powder, salt and the cold water and mix well – the batter should have the consistency of whole milk. Pour the oil into a non-stick frying pan to about 3cm deep and set over a low-medium heat. Test the readiness of the oil by placing a piece of dal in the oil; if the oil gently sizzles without rising to the surface, the oil is ready (if you have a thermometer, the oil should reach 130–140C). Turn off a low-medium heat. Stir the batter well with a ladle before scooping up a portion and very gently and slowly pouring it into a non-stick frying pan, keeping the ladle close to the oil’s surface. the batter should sink to the base of a non-stick frying pan, making a flat, roundish cracker. You can use the back of a ladle to flatten the soaked chana dal in a colander if the soaked chana dal in a colander has become a “mound”. If a non-stick frying pan is big enough, repeat ladling 2–3 crackers in the same way. Set a timer for a minute, then turn a low-medium heat back up to high. Leave the crackers to sizzle gently. the crackers will appear floppy if you prod the crackers, but do not worry – the crackers should slowly rise to the oil’s surface and start to turn golden after 5 minutes (encourage the crackers to lift off the bottom of a non-stick frying pan with a fish slice, if needed). Turn the crackers over to cook for another 4–5 minutes. Once nicely golden and crisp, remove carefully and shake off any excess oil. Place on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Turn off a low-medium heat and wait for the oil to cool – this will take about 3 minutes. Repeat the process, making sure you stir the dal batter well before each scoop, turning a low-medium heat off for a minute, then turning a low-medium heat back on to high, and so on. Lightly season the crackers and serve.</segment>

				<segment>Line a plate with a few sheets of kitchen paper. Heat the oil in a deep, medium saucepan or wok set over a medium-high heat. Do not leave a non-stick frying pan unattended. Have a heatproof strainer or sieve ready for fishing out the garlic pieces. Test the readiness of the oil by placing a piece of garlic in it; if it sizzles and comes to the surface within a few seconds, the oil is ready and you can add all the garlic at once, turning a low-medium heat down to low. Keep a close eye on all the garlic, turning the garlic pieces regularly in the oil, being careful not to splash hot oil on yourself. Turn a low-medium heat down if all the garlic is colouring quickly – we sometimes remove a non-stick frying pan from a low-medium heat completely for a minute or so if a non-stick frying pan’s doing this. Once the garlic pieces are golden brown and crisp, take a non-stick frying pan off a low-medium heat. Scoop out the garlic pieces using a heatproof strainer or sieve and transfer the garlic pieces to the plate with the kitchen paper, to stop the garlic pieces cooking further. It doesn’t matter if a few pieces remain in the oil. Stir the turmeric into the oil and leave to cool, then pour it into a clean, airtight bottle. You can then return the garlic pieces to the oil (the garlic pieces will remain crispy) or keep the garlic pieces separate to garnish other dishes. the oil can be stored in a clean, airtight bottle in a cool, dark place for up to 1 month, though in our house there’s rarely any left by that point. If you are keeping the garlic pieces separate, the garlic pieces can be stored in an airtight container in a cool place for 2–3 weeks. To make the mohinga, first prepare the rice flour. Toast the rice flour in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for 3–5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Tip the rice flour out onto a plate and set aside.</segment>

Cut off and discard the first 5cm of the thin end of the lemongrass stalks and remove the tough outer layer, then bash what remains with a pestle or rolling pin to release the flavours. Heat the oil in a large casserole dish over a medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and stir for 1 minute, then add the lemongrass stalks. Add the spices, shrimp paste, if using, and fish sauce and stir well. Then add the contents of the pilchards tin, including the brine. Mash the fish, then add the rice flour and mix well to prevent the rice flour sticking to the bottom of a non-stick frying pan. Top up with 1. 2 litres of water and add the whole peeled shallots. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 1 hour, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Once cooked, remove the lemongrass stalks, add a good grinding of black pepper and adjust the seasoning with a little fish sauce. Put some drained rice noodles into each individual serving bowl, ladle over the soup, add a squeeze of lime, a drizzle of garlic oil, some chilli, as desired, and top with boiled eggs, coriander leaves and your broken up crackers. Serve immediately. the soup can be made in advance and stored in the fridge for up to 4 days. the soup can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Here we cook the chicken fresh for this salad, but you could always make it using leftover roast chicken. we would recommend keeping the skin on the thighs when roasting them, because it keeps the flesh moist and adds a wonderful crispy texture to this salad.

				<segment>Coat the chicken thighs with the spices and the salt, and place on a baking tray in the oven. Roast for 35 minutes (check they are cooked by piercing them – the juices should run clear), then set aside to cool. Roughly shred the chicken with a fork and knife and place in a large bowl. When ready to serve, divide this salad among four plates, then garnish each with the coriander, a sprinkle of chilli flakes and a teaspoon of fried shallots. Serve immediately. this salad contrasts crunchy peanuts with vibrant fresh tomatoes. Use the best quality tomatoes you can buy to get the most out of this dish. this salad is best made fresh on the day, and can be served as a side with one of our curries or just simply with some rice. Crush the peanuts using a pestle and mortar or pulse a few times in a food processor (to the size of the nubs you get in a crunchy peanut butter). Place the tomatoes, chilli, crushed peanuts and remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix. Ideally, do this with clean hands to fully combine all the ingredients. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more fish sauce or chilli if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the crispy shallots. In a serving dish and garnish with the crispy shallots we have tender baby aubergines stuffed with a strongly flavoured, shrimp-infused, spicy stuffing. You can use normal-sized aubergines if you can’t get hold of the baby ones – they just need to be cooked for a bit longer. Unfortunately a serving dish and garnish with the crispy shallots isn’t quite the same without the shrimp elements; a serving dish and garnish with the crispy shallots would still taste great but a serving dish and garnish with the crispy shallots would lack the umami kick. Pound the dried shrimps to a powder using a pestle and mortar, or use a food processor. Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a large lidded frying pan over a low-medium heat and cook the onion and garlic for about 10 minutes until soft and golden coloured. Add the chilli flakes, turmeric and paprika to a non-stick frying pan and stir for a minute or two, until fragrant. Stir in the shrimp paste, so it melts into the mixture, add the shrimp powder and mix well, then empty the contents of a non-stick frying pan into a separate bowl.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Cut the aubergines in half along their length, but not all the way through, keeping the stem intact. Then make another cut along the length, again preserving the stem, so the aubergine is in quarters but still connected by the stem. Carefully “fill” each aubergine with the mixture with your hands. This may get a bit messy and some of the filling may fall out, but that is fine. You should be left with a small amount of filling to add to the cooking sauce. Give a non-stick frying pan a bit of a wipe with kitchen paper, then heat the remaining oil in a non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Carefully add the aubergines. Try to turn them over carefully so that all sides are charred. This should take a couple of minutes. Add 150ml of water to a non-stick frying pan with the remaining filling and bring to the boil. Leave to simmer with a lid on. After 15 minutes the aubergines should be soft and ready to serve. Garnish with the whole peeled shallots. This is an absolutely winning combination of flavours that we have served up at several supper clubs over the years. This’s perfect for entertaining because the meringues and lime curd can be made the night before, so the dessert only needs a quick assemble just before serving.</segment>

				<segment>Our meringue-making method is the Delia Smith one – reliable every time. In a clean, dry mixing bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric whisk. Start on a low speed and gradually increase the speed over the next 2–3 minutes to the highest setting until the egg whites are stiff peaks, then stop. Add half the sugar to the egg whites and whisk at high speed, then add the remaining sugar until the meringue is glossy and firm – this usually takes 2 minutes. Line two baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Spoon 4 mounds of meringue on to each sheet, spaced out evenly. Using the back of a spoon, make a shallow dip in the centre of each meringue, where the topping will sit once they’re cooked. Place the trays in the oven for 35 minutes; once that time is up, switch off the oven and leave the meringues to cool and dry in there overnight. While the meringues are cooking, prepare the lime curd. Make a bain-marie with a heatproof bowl set over some simmering water (make sure the bowl does not touch the water, though) and add all the ingredients for the lime curd. Stir to dissolve the remaining sugar and melt the butter. Making the lime curd requires a bit of patience, as the lime curd will take anywhere between 6 and 8 minutes to thicken: the lime curd should coat the back of a wooden spoon when the lime curd is done. We then strain the lime curd through a sieve, to get rid of the zest, and let the lime curd cool before refrigerating overnight in a covered container. For the assembly, toast the desiccated coconut in a dry frying pan on the hob, stirring throughout – watch it carefully and don’t let it turn brown, it will only take a minute. Whip the double cream until the assembly’s thick. Plate up the meringues, then top each one with a spoonful of cream, a dollop of lime curd, some mango pieces and finally a sprinkling of toasted coconut. Serve immediately. the meringues can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week. the lime curd can be stored in a sterilised container in the fridge for 1–2 weeks.</segment>

Serves 2-3 hungry people on its own, or 4 if eaten with bread and cheese or a couple of grilled sausages on the side Heat a griddle pan over the highest heat until it is smoking. It’s really important for it to be searing hot before adding the courgettes. Put the courgettes into a bowl, drizzle with the olive oil and toss until evenly coated. Lay half of the courgettes and cook for approximately one minute on each side until charred all over. Add the courgettes to the beans and repeat with the remaining. Toast the walnut pieces for two minutes and add them to the beans. Turn the heat off and add the garlic, shallots and red wine vinegar to the griddle pan. Let this sizzle vigorously for 30 seconds before pouring it over the other ingredients.

Falastin by Sami Tamimi and Tara Wigley is out now Broad bean, dill and tomato salad by Georgina Hayden One of my earliest memories is podding broad beans with my (grandmas), and whenever I mention this, it seems like a popular memory for many, not just me. Doing this now with my own daughter, I can see why the older generations would enlist the help of any children in the vicinity. Not only is there something mindful and peaceful about shelling and podding the beans, but it also keeps small hands surprisingly busy and quiet. Of course, we can buy frozen all year round, as with peas, but taking the time to prepare broad beans while in season has to be one of the simplest joys in the kitchen, and makes the little beans taste all the sweeter.</segment>

However, with the hot weather, I’ve taken my favourite dish and made it into a fresher, lighter salad. my favourite dish may look simple, but my favourite dish is far greater than the sum of my favourite dish parts. Just be sure to be generous with the seasoning here, and serve with fresh, crusty bread – ideally koulouri or simit if you can.

Georgina Hayden is a cook and food writer; georginahayden. com Since first considering the idea of this special, summertime salad, there crept in, along the way, a vague reference to the Sichuan bang-bang chicken. Note: as an added frivolity, you may like to remove the skin from the raw chicken breasts, salt them, grill or fry until crisp, then shred as a sprinkle over the finished dish. 4 (approx 300g), chopped into very small pieces using a heavy knife Put the chicken wings into a stainless-steel pan and add the next 8 ingredients. Slowly bring up to a simmer, allow a veil of scum to form on the surface and leave to only simmer for an hour or so, covered; the stock must remain undisturbed to remain clear. Strain through a fine sieve into a deep, clean pan and allow to drip. Discard the exhausted solids.</segment>

However, this time only simmer for 1 minute then turn off heat and cover. Leave for 20 minutes, then turn the breasts over, again simmer for 1 minute, cover and leave to cool completely. Lift out the Sichuan bang-bang chicken onto a plate and put in the fridge. Put the gelatine to soak in cold water. Now quietly reduce the stock by about one-third, skimming off any scum that forms (there should not be much), remove from the heat and stir in the gelatine until melted. Line a sieve/colander with a fine piece of cotton cloth (I use an old cotton napkin), suspended over a bowl and carefully pour the stock through. Allow to drip, then remove a fine sieve and put the stock to “jell” in the fridge. Once set, mix up the jelly with a fork and stir in the chilli and coriander. Slice the Sichuan bang-bang chicken into really fine shreds and fold through the jelly until well mixed. Return to the fridge. For the salad, slice the cucumbers not too thinly (between 0. 5 and 1cm) on the diagonal; most accurate and easy using a mandolin. Then, stacking the slices in 3, cut into sticks to the same thickness. Place in a bowl and stir in the salt, sugar and vinegar.

Return to a bowl and stir in the mayonnaise/mustard mix, the sesame oil and the chives, and mix well. To serve, take shallow bowls – soup plates, say, and preferably pre-chilled in the fridge – and arrange a generous tablespoonful of the jellied chicken on one side, then a similar-sized serving of the cucumber salad on the other. Serve without delay.</segment>

				<segment>Garlic and lemongrass bavette steak, watercress, pea shoots and rice noodle salad by Uyen Luu I have been enjoying versions of this beef noodle salad all summer. noodle salad all summer has been a textural and refreshing delight at the dinner table during lockdown. The crunch and peppery flavours of watercress and the floral sweetness of pea shoots, mixed with the acidic lime and fiery chillies, bring joyful satisfaction to the palate. True to Vietnamese-style salad, adding rice noodles makes this a complete meal balanced with lots of exciting and exhilarating flavours of summer.</segment>

Finely chop the lemongrass, add to a small bowl with the crushed garlic cloves, soy sauce and butter. Mix well together and set aside. To prepare Vietnamese-style salad, divide the watercress and pea shoots between two large bowls or plates. Rehydrate the rice vermicelli noodles by placing them in a vessel, pouring boiling water over and soaking for 5 minutes. Drain, briefly wash with hot water in a sieve or colander and cover. Slice the spring onions and cook the rice vermicelli noodles gently in a small pan with 1 tbsp of oil for 5 minutes, then set aside. To make the salad dressing, place all the ingredients into a bowl and mix well together or shake in a jar. To sear the steak (medium rare), place on a good frying or griddle pan on high heat until hot. Season the steak with salt and pepper and place in the pan. After 3 minutes, turn over and pour the garlic and lemongrass butter over the pan and cook for a further 3 minutes. Toss the steak (medium rare) until it is all covered. Turn off the heat and place a lid over the steak (medium rare) for 5 minutes then rest on a chopping board for a further 5 minutes. Meanwhile, add the noodles to the salad bowl and smoother with the spring onion oil. Slice the steak (medium rare), cutting half against the grain and half with the grain to get different bites and textures. Fry 2 eggs sunny side up, then add one to each of the bowls.

I’m a junior doctor; I’d taken time out of medical training for rowing. I got straight on the phone and asked if I could come back to work the next week. Within two hours, I had all the forms filled in. I was on the general medicine ward in Daisy Hill hospital in Newry the following Wednesday. I was doing medicine long before I ever rowed. I gave rowing a go in my second year at Queen’s University in Belfast. I started winning British university titles. I posted good times and came 15th in the men’s single sculls at the World Cup 2018. But you’re not going to make your name coming 15th. I was ready to leave rowing behind That.</segment>

I knew I’d be returning to a different healthcare system than the one I left. I’m on medicine ward; it’s been very busy. it’s good to have a purpose and to go back to something that is appreciated by the public. I still train every day on a rowing machine in the garage and, since lockdown eased, I’ve been back out on the water. But medicine is my job; when rowing stops this is what I do. My passion is emergency medicine. I love those situations where you have to act now. I’ll finish on ward in December and go back to rowing full time ahead of Tokyo 2021.</segment>

So when my dance track, Hideaway, became a hit in 2014, it gave me the opportunity to do both. I was performing every day for two years. it became my life. I went from playing open mics in front of five people to being on the stage at Wembley, six months later. I had started writing my next album when I was in a car accident in July 2017. The Uber I was in was knocked off the road. I saw the car coming, curled into a ball and was thrust forward. I suffered a traumatic brain injury. That was the end of that era for Jimmy Lin. Brain injuries are painful in ways you can’t explain. I lost balance on the left side of my body. To begin with, I fell down stairs, I had bad headaches and problems with digestion. It’s an injury that no one can see. I had to stay home all the time. If I went out, I would come home in excruciating pain. I could barely do anything. When I first started in music, just getting a song out was a huge milestone.</segment>

I gave Jimmy Lin a few months to get my stamina up and I surprised Jimmy Lin. It was amazing. So from there this tiny acoustic tour became about setting new milestones. Last year was set to be a big milestone for Jimmy Lin. I was getting back to dancing. I’ve been dancing in my new music videos. I’ll dance and then I’ll crash for three days afterwards because my brain is so tired. I navigate my career based on a traumatic brain injury. I was set to open for my friend Lindsey Stirling this summer on this tiny acoustic tour. I wasn’t ready to do this tiny acoustic tour but I wanted to tour so bad. I knew I could do a 30-minute set if I started rehearsing and building my stamina up. I’d planned to dance and sing in the show. The pandemic ended those plans. I was at home in Toronto when I heard from my manager about the tour cancellation. I wasn’t shocked because by that point almost every tour in the world had been cancelled. But it would have been a big stepping stone on my road to recovery. As hard as it was to hear that this tiny acoustic tour was cancelled, I understand the need to keep people safe during The pandemic.</segment>

My life isn’t the same without no idea but I look at no idea this way: I have more time to be a better performer. So when we do tour again, I will be able to do a full show. That will be amazing. I celebrate my birthday every year. It’s no different turning 100. I just like parties – I like my friends. It was awful not having one this year but I’m saving this year up.

				<segment> inot noir is the world’s most dangerously seductive grape variety. Fussy to the point of absurdity about the climatic and geological conditions in which it will deign to perform, and easily spoiled in the winery, it has been known to break hearts and careers, making despairing Jean de Florettes of even the most seasoned winemakers. Yet itthe world’s still invited into vineyards all over the world, a homogenising, gentrifying force, replacing perfectly good, well-adapted local grape varieties, turning good winemakers bad, and the wines it produces are almost never as good as the hype and the prices suggest. Pinot noir gets away with its bad behaviour because, if the lows are lower than other grapes, the highs are so much higher. In Burgundy, pinot noirthe world’s ancestral home, it is responsible for reds of life-changing beauty. I really do mean life-changing and I really do mean beauty: two good friends and many more acquaintances of mine have given up sensible, well-paid jobs to start again in the wine trade after falling for the silken texture and allusive flavours – as well as the microscopically local variations in style – of great red burgundy. My own experience has been rather different. I started to love wine just as burgundy was replacing bordeaux in the hearts of collectors and investors, and were sashaying out of my reach. Most of my experiences of great burgundy have been the result of the generosity of friends, not bottles I’ve bought falling for the silken texture and allusive flavours – as well as the microscopically local variations in style – of great red burgundy. When I tried pinot noirs made by winemakers who had been dazzled by burgundy’s artisan glamour and tried to reproduce it elsewhere in the world, I was often disappointed: the magic was missing, and prices were nowhere near cheap enough to compensate. Over the past couple of years I’ve been having a bit of a reappraisal of pinot beyond burgundy, however. All over the world, there’s a feeling of things clicking into place: vineyard plantings in suitable sites (generally speaking cooler, with more appropriate soils) have started to mature, yielding better balanced grapes; producers have come to understand how pinot works in their own vineyards, and to accept their own stylistic parameters rather than constantly referring back to burgundy; winemaking nous is more readily shared, both within regions and at the plethora of professional international pinot noir conferences, symposiums and tastings, as well as on social media.</segment>

Few pinot regions have improved more than Germany in the past couple of decades. This is a great place to start on what is known locally as spätburgunder, a succulent, racy, light red for chilling filled with strawberries and a hint of pinot earthiness.</segment>

				<segment>Pinot noir doesn’t generally thrive in the Languedoc, where the heat is better suited to Mediterranean varieties. But this is a very slickly executed exception, avoiding the soupiness of its peers for a subtly spicy, supple red. The makers of the first great pinot from the Atacama Desert, the elegant Tara Red Wine No. 1 2016 (£37, ), also have this graceful, refreshing, red-fruited gem that shows off the breezy freshness on offer in Pacific coastal Leyda. Proof it’s still possible to find attractive pinot noir from Burgundy under £20. From a single vineyard near the village of Pommard, this is enchantingly slinky with perfectly rendered summer berry fruit. Central Otago may be the better known region for Kiwi pinot, but Marlborough isn’t all sauvignon blanc. Anna and Jason Flowerday’s organic red is pinot at its prettiest and purest, with feathery light tannins and luminously bright raspberry fruit. Chanin Wine Company Santa Barbara County Pinot Noir A fine example of new-wave California pinot noir from the state’s ocean-cooled hotspot for the variety, Gavin Chanin’s village level wine is typically fragrant, pretty and elegant, with lots of energy and sappy snap in the polished red cherry fruit.</segment>

That was SB 1070. “We were optimistic that we could stop [then governor] Jan Brewer from signing that bill,” said Raquel Terán, who joined protesters at the state capitol that day. “Obviously We didn’t, but it showed that We had the capacity to mobilize We communities. ” Today Terán works in the copper-domed capitol building where she used to protest. Terán was elected as a Democrat in 2018 to represent a majority-Hispanic district in the Arizona house of representatives. The decade-long backlash to the immigration law, accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, demographic change and population growth, is reshaping the state’s political landscape, turning one of the last conservative bastions of the south-west into a battleground that could determine control of the White House and the Senate. With less than four months until the election, show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the president in Arizona, a state Trump won in 2016 by fewer than four percentage points, a far narrower margin than past Republican nominees. Then, in 2018, in November’s midterm elections, young Latino voters cast votes in record numbers, Kyrsten Sinema – the first Democrat to win a US senate seat in Arizona in decades. have found Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and husband of former congresswoman , polling ahead of the Republican incumbent Martha McSally, who was appointed to the seat after the death of Operatives in both parties believe Trump&apos;s anti-immigrant rhetoric has hurt him in Arizona While Trump’s embrace of hardline, anti-immigrant rhetoric seemed to rally Trump base in the midwest, operatives in both parties believe it has hurt Trump in Arizona, a border state where many were trying to move beyond the divisive politics that had tarnished their brand with Latino voters. When lawmakers in 2010 introduced SB 1070, which included a provision requiring law enforcement to determine the immigration status of anyone officers had “reasonable suspicion” to believe was in the country illegally, the political, economic and cultural backlash was swift. Businesses, sports teams, musicians, even the city of Los Angeles, boycotted Arizona, and Jon Stewart mocked it as the “meth lab of democracy”. “There was political overreach from the right, and SB 1070 was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Marisa Franco, the co-founder of the social justice advocacy group Mijente. “It awakened an electorate that’s, I think, more justice-minded.</segment>

				<segment>” , the senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee considered the godfather of modern conservatism in America, has long eluded Democrats. No Democratic presidential candidate has won Arizona since 1996, and between 2008 and 2018, no Democrat was elected statewide at any level. Now, Arizona is a top target for the Biden campaign. In recent years, an influx of new residents from more liberal states like California, and a growing electoral clout of Latinos, have slowly shifted Arizona’s political landscape, as Arizona population becomes more diverse and less rural. Yet a key factor driving Arizona competitiveness this cycle are the residents living in the Valley’s famous suburban sprawl, who are abandoning the Republican party. “SB 1070 turned on this radical element in the Republican party that started pushing out moderates and replacing them with very rabid, Anglo anti-immigrant Republicans,” said Gallego swept to elected office in the years after the law went into effect. “Now you have a generation of young Latinos who are starting to vote aligning with a new coalition of moderate suburban women. ” , Gallego added, is how to mobilize the young Latinos demanding systemic change without alienating white moderates craving stability and leadership. Another reason for Democratic optimism in the state is the boiling frustration over the handling oArizonaoronavirus pandemic by Doug Ducey. Trump with Doug Ducey as the president tours a section of the border wall in June. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Arizona is facing one of the worst outbreaks in the nation, after the state raced to reopen bars, restaurants and businesses. More than 143,600 people have contracted Covid-19 in Arizona, overwhelming hospitals. Maricopa county, which encompasses Phoenix, has Doug Ducey initially prevented local governments from setting their own coronavirus-related policies but the Trump administration to send hundreds of healthcare workers to the state to help. As elsewhere, the coronavirus pandemic has exacted a disproportionate toll on Arizona’s Black, Latino, and Native American residents. In a widely-shared obituary published by the , a daughter blamed her father’s death from Covid-19 on “the carelessness of the politicians who continue to jeopardize the health of brown bodies through a clear lack of leadership”. What remains unclear is the extent to which anger will propel Latino voters to cast ballots. In 2016 and 2018, Latinos voted at higher rates than in previous elections but organizers have warned that Democrats must invest more deeply in turning out this critical constituency. Strategists believe the playbook for Democrats to be successful in the state is moderation and an appeal to bipartisanship.</segment>

				<segment>In a memo drafted after McSally’s 2018 loss, a daughter campaign noted that Sinema had “hugged McCain tightly, and never once had the word ‘Democrat’ in a TV advertisement”. Barnes, said: “The only way to win statewide as a Democrat in Arizona is to act like you’re not a Democrat. ” Barnes is skeptical that Republicans are headed for a political reckoning in November. Barnes said Democrats have moved too far left for a state that remains largely in Republican control. Particularly on issues like policing, Barnes said Democrats are at risk of alienating white moderate voters who have historically sided with the “law-and-order side of the equation”. Trump has staked his candidacy on a message of “law and order,” despite dramatic shifts away from his views on issues of race and policing in America. In a naked appeal to white suburban voters this week, Trump said that a Biden presidency would “obliterate” their way of life, declaring: “Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. ” I think it’s very possible for Arizona to turn not just blue, but even a shade further But in a sign Trump sees a fight in the desert, Trump has visited Arizona twice in two months, once in May to and again for a rally in June, as coronavirus cases rose sharply in Arizona. Because Latino voters in Arizona tend to overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates, whether or not Arizona will turn blue, “really hinges on turnout,” said Arizona. “You’d think during the election of Donald Trump, we would have seen even more mobilization,” Sanchez said. “You’d think all the anti-immigrant anti-Latino rhetoric would have fired people up. ” Activists have been laying the groundwork for years, led by groups like One Arizona, a coalition of organizations focused on Latino civic engagement that was formed in the wake of SB 1070. Tried and tested methods like voter registration and canvassing helped power Democratic gains in 2018 - and, they hope, will dramatically reshape the electorate in 2020. “Our folks were those people that would potentially not vote – not because Our folks didn’t want to, but because Our folks just simply didn’t know how to or there was a language barrier,” Liz Zamudio, One Arizona’s deputy field director said. Immigration is a priority for many Latino voters in the state but so too are healthcare and education, Zamudio said, especially as the coronavirus devastates their communities and a debate rages over when to return children to schools. Yet organizers and strategists have expressed concern that Democrats are not doing enough to mobilize young Latino voters, particularly in swing states like Arizona, where they could determine the outcome. Josh Ulibarri, a Phoenix-based Democratic pollster, said he has spent the past six weeks surveying voters in Arizona, conducting thousands of interviews from across the state. “I’ve yet to pull a survey out of a field where I felt comfortable with where we are with Latino voters,” Josh Ulibarri, a Phoenix-based Democratic pollster said, adding: “I am really worried about enthusiasm. And I’m really worried about motivation.</segment>

Priorities USA, the main pro-Biden Super Pac, announced it is investing $24m in a mobilization and vote-by-mail effort targeting Black and Latino voters in battleground states, including Arizona. For liberal activists in Arizona, a surge in Latino turnout would be the ultimate repudiation of the nativist politics that defined their youths. The success of candidates like Terán in 2018, they say, is a testament to the years they spent building a grassroots movement. Born in Douglas, Arizona, Terán was raised on the Mexican side of the border and crossed into the US every day for school. Alarmed by what she saw as rising hostility to immigrants in her state, Terán’s first political act was to register Latino voters. Years later, she asked for Latino voters vote. Days after winning she seat, Terán was served a lawsuit challenging she citizenship in court. she saw it as a strain of the birther movement, promoted by Trump, that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama, the nation first black president. The case was dismissed but for Terán and she supporters, it was a reminder of the formidable opposition that still exists in Arizona. “Ten years ago I was standing outside the capitol with a megaphone,” she said. “Now I have a microphone and a seat at the table.</segment>

Brunel’s innovative design for the first propeller-driven, iron-hulled steamship revolutionised shipping. At the time, SS Great Britain was the largest ship in the world, at 1,930 tons and almost 100 metres long. But the largest ship in the world had a chequered history. the largest ship in the world started as a transatlantic passenger ship, and then spent 24 years carrying emigrants to Australia – more than 16,000 in total, many intent on making a fortune in the 19th-century gold rush – and troops to and from the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. In the early 1880s, the largest ship in the world was converted into a three-masted sailing ship, transporting Welsh coal to America’s west coast.

The idea of returning SS Great Britain to SS Great Britain birthplace began to capture imagination.

Jack Hayward, a property millionaire and later owner of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, stumped up £150,000. On the Falkland Islands, some said “the project was madness, others said the hulk should not leave … while one influential islander noted the money to be spent on the salvage would go halfway to paying for a much needed airstrip,” wrote Morrison. a salvage operation was not straightforward. A team of divers worked around the clock in icy water and stormy weather. A massive crack on the starboard side was stuffed with mattresses donated by islanders and patched up with plywood, and three huge masts weighing more than 30 tons each had to be removed before it could be refloated. Meanwhile, a huge submersible pontoon towed by a trawler made it could be refloated way from west Africa to the Falklands.

You might think, that time I lost my child in a shopping centre, or the moment the doctor told me it was serious, or the night I was followed home from the bus stop, or as I was walking up to the stage to give my big speech. All of those moments can prompt good old-fashioned fear, but what you probably won’t instantly recall is all the other times when fear has been present inside you: the many moments when fear has been controlling you, without you knowing it. it’s there when you feel unfulfilled, as if there’s something missing; when no amount of success is quite enough.</segment>

				<segment>And it’s also there when you feel jealous, judge people, are overcome by perfectionism, or feel the need to crush a colleague. After working for 20 years as a performance psychologist and culture coach, helping people find better, happier ways to work and play, I have reached the conclusion that all of us are driven by fear. all of us. It’s a matter of degree. I’ve spent most of my time in locker rooms and boardrooms, trackside, poolside and pitchside, and in my daily conversations the same themes have come up time and time again: shame, inadequacy, loneliness, dissatisfaction and fear. Now we find ourselves in a time when fear has become our new currency. Throughout the pandemic there has been a constant dripping of fear, a sense of catastrophic possibilities.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>There is a deep feeling of something having shifted, and we’re not quite sure what it means yet. Humans don’t like ambiguity very much, and we especially don’t like a freefall into the future. Much of the fear is logical. Is it safe to go to a restaurant or a pub again? Is it less likely we’ll catch it now that we’re more cautious about going out?</segment>

				<segment>Will the “new normal” always look like this? Fear, by design, is a warning system that puts us on alert and demands attention. It is a necessary neurobiological response to a stimulus that says: “Heads up, get ready to assess and act”. When we watch the news, listening to a breaking segment about the crisis on our doorsteps, we are priming ourselves to react. we are wired for fear. But even with the very real fears of a pandemic, we don’t need nearly as much of it as we experience. So how do we manage a pandemic? The first step is to notice we, pay attention to we thought processes. Many of we fall into a pattern of repetitive thinking which is largely negative. If you stop to study your thoughts over an hour, you’ll be shocked at how many of them are on a loop, draining and judgmental. The more we let go of our awareness and allow ourselves to be carried by this tide of incessant thinking, the more room we give to fear. One of the most useful things we can do is to learn to check our emotional and physical responses. If you are tense from lockdown and money arguments, exhausted and Zoomed-out, stop and reflect, listen to the loop of thoughts in your head and recognise them. Once you’re more aware of these patterns, a helpful approach is to tackle these irrational thoughts with logic – a technique that freediver William Trubridge has perfected over the years. Freediving is an extreme and experimental sport because it’s about pushing the physical body to its limits. Freediving’s also a good example of harnessing the mind and finding out what it is capable of. A freediver has to descend on a single breath to the deepest, darkest depths that they can tolerate physiologically and psychologically before turning to make the dangerous ascent back to the surface. The mindset that underpins Trubridge’s beyond-human aquatic feats is the absolute opposite of fear. It’s the ability to truly experience each moment. I call It mental freedom.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>In May 2016 Trubridge dived 122m in the ocean in the Bahamas, a dive of four minutes and 24 seconds. For most of us, just the thought of being that deep in the sea would be beyond terrifying. Some high-profile divers have lost their lives. But Trubridge says that isn’t what worries Trubridge. “In freediving Trubridge there is very little that scares me,” Trubridge says. “I see the risk as a calculated one that’s quite minimal in cases where we are training with adequate safety or in competitions. ” Like Trubridge, you can make a choice of considering whatever’s happening in terms of possibilities, not risks. We only have a finite amount of attention; use it deliberately. Trubridge’s coldly rational about the risks and the safety measures. “People often ask me, what would you do if something happened at depth? If you were down there by yourself? What if something goes wrong? When I consider that, I can’t come up with any scenarios that aren’t provided for that have any degree of probability. Although obviously freak things can happen. ” Trubridge remains resolutely logical. “In freediving, the water is the same at the surface as it is at depth. The only other variable is yourself. You are completely in control. You can provide for the risks that you know about. People think what I’m doing is on a death wish or is kamikaze, but if anything it’s the exact opposite.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>” I learned to control my fears with the thought: nerves aren’t real Trubridge relies on a rationalising technique called “nerves aren’t real”, which he developed after realising that his nemesis is not a fear of the actual dive, but a fear of failure. It’s important to be able to distinguish between the two. real Trubridge says: “When I felt the fluttering sensation that heralds this anxiety, I didn’t shy away from It, but rather looked for a concrete source in the present moment, and when I couldn’t find one It was further confirmation that nerves aren’t real. Gradually, rather than being at the mercy of these nerves, I was able to keep them in control and brush them aside with a cursory thought, ‘nerves aren’t real. ’” Trubridge also had a second rationalisation technique ready, called “the other extreme”. Instead of trying to minimise his fear of failure and embarrassment, he ramped it right up. his imagined that people would die if his didn’t succeed. “When compared to those kind of stakes, the fear of simply being embarrassed is laughable. ” his didn’t let his get sucked into catastrophic thought. Rather, his says: “I entertain the idea for just long enough to put in perspective how frivolous this circus-style record attempt really is; how silly I was to let something so trivial affect my emotional state. ” While Trubridge’s approach is designed to tackle fear in the moment – rather than the long-term anxieties of living with the pandemic – there are still lessons to be learned.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>his recognises that most of what we fear is a projection of what might happen in the future, not something that is happening to us in the moment, and crucially, it may never happen at all. Trubridge says that in his sport – as in life – it’s easy to get caught up in “what if? ” thinking, where your mind can take you into unwanted drama. You are not your thoughts, and a lot of your fear-filled thoughts are simply rubbish you habitually recycle. It is impossible to do that if you are only in the present moment. Trubridge gets there by repeating a mantra. “The idea is, you have these words with powerful connotations so they can very quickly get you into the necessary state,” he says. One he often uses: “Now is all. ” Many of us get defensive when we are stressed and fearful. Not only is there a rupture that threatens us stability, us are conditioned through life to never lose control, and invest heavily in having things us way.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>When they aren’t, one of the ways that people use to regain a sense of control and power is to take a position and stick with it. To maintain us position as “right” us judge and shame other people as wrong. Sometimes when us judge, it is fear taking control. us waste emotional energy regularly on fear, shame, negativity and doubt. This is especially likely when us are in the grip of changes that us didn’t want. Remember, the thoughts you give preference to when fear and anxiety comes up will play a big role in dictating your emotional experiences. Don’t add perfectionism to your Covid-19 to-do list.

A group of northern states - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden,  styled the “frugal four” - are wary of fiscal transfers. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte takes the most hardline position, as he also wants his government to be able to veto recovery funds if a recipient is deemed failing on economic reforms. Adding to the complexity is an argument  over tying EU funds to respect for democratic values. Hungary and Poland, currently subject to EU inquiries on the rule of law, want a veto on any attempt to remove funds from a rogue government. France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, who fear the weakening of democratic checks and balances, say there must be a link. Now some diplomats fear the issue could become hostage to a recovery plan deal. “some diplomats ran off in a bad mood,” Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte complained. “We are ready to compromise without giving up ambition,” said Macron. The third battleground also put the Dutch in the firing line, as Hungary prime minister, , compared Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte to the communist police.

It is a document called “Internal estimates of excess deaths from Covid-19”, prepared by officials from the Department of Health and Social Care, the ONS, the government’s actuary’s department and the Home Office. The NHS is trying to reduce risks from COVID-19 to patients and increase its ability to respond to the crisis, by continuing to treat urgent elective patients, such as most cancer treatments, and deprioritising non-urgent care, with an emphasis on risk management.</segment>

				<segment>This should avoid short-term deaths but there will be a longer-term knock-on impact from delaying so many non-urgent services . .. We are unable to provide a detailed estimate of the impact of these changes to healthcare activity as it is unclear precisely what activity would be postponed, for how long, what knock-on impact this would have on future patient waits, and how a delay in treatment would affect outcomes. Instead, We have modelled a scenario whereby we assume 75% of elective care activity is stopped for a period of 6 months. Various evidence supports the estimate that 75% of elective care has been postponed, but it is unclear how long the postponement will be for. This activity represents around £17bn of expenditure over a 6-month period. If This activity were cancelled entirely This activity would result in an estimated 185,000 additional deaths . .. This is an upper-bound estimate for this scenario. The NHS will be prioritising life-saving treatments and will be hoping to postpone rather than cancel most of this treatment. However, there will be a knock-on impact on future patients as The NHS takes time to work through the backlog. If services can be resumed quickly, most of the risk of mortality can likely be managed, but if there are continuing delays for a longer period, there could even be a proportionately greater impact than is estimated here, if long waiting lists build up and have a knock-on impact on future patients requiring healthcare.

Plan to put childcare in place because many parents of course will have been furloughed and at home looking after their children and so may have cancelled their own childcare arrangements . .. I think the problem we have got is that The government is making grand announcements at very short notice and not really giving businesses or schools and childcare providers or families proper advance notice so they can put their necessary arrangements in place. &quot;The government has a bit of a tendency to wash The government hands of all that detail&quot; Green said said one in four childcare providers believe they will not be in business by the end of the year, adding that the prospect of providers going out of business was “really worrying” for parents who need to find childcare when they return to work. The problem for childcare providers is that lack of capacity means a lack of income and some of them are becoming financially unviable. So the consequence of less demand is that it’s possible, and indeed the childcare providers are saying this, that some of them will go out of business altogether. One in four think the childcare providers may not still be around within the year, and that’s really worrying when parents need to find childcare places so they can go back to work and know that their children are being looked after safely.</segment>

The initial findings suggest a new treatment for Covid-19 cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by 79%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Southampton-based biotech Synairgen claims. Southampton-based biotech Synairgen said the clinical trial also indicated &quot;very significant&quot; reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment.

Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that Interferon beta can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. &quot;If you know it&apos;s a drug, your mind might have a bias,&quot; explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered The new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital.

What we need is a fast and reliable way of spotting those around us who are infected. fewer than one in four people testing positive for coronavirus have symptoms on the day they get tested. That highlights the risk of the virus being spread by people who aren&apos;t aware they are infected. The second issue is the test itself.

The swab, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has to be sent to a lab and takes a few hours to process. Nine out of 10 people who attend one of the drive-in centres get their result back within 24 hours. But it&apos;s not yet a while-you-wait service. So what we need is a rapid, easy and reliable test for coronavirus. Some fast-turnaround swab tests are being trialled, which would be a big step forward. saliva tests could be a real gamechanger Imagine if all you had to do was spit into a tube to find out if you have coronavirus. OK, it&apos;s not quite as simple as that. The saliva sample has to be sent to a laboratory, but the result can be turned around far quicker than a swab test.

It seems people become positive in their saliva before the rest of their breathing tubes. &quot;If we are seeking to pick up people in the early course of the infection, this may be the way forwards. &quot; The success of the trial depends on how accurate the saliva test is at detecting coronavirus. The samples from the Southampton study are being processed at the Animal and Plant Health Agency government laboratories in Surrey. The samples from the Southampton study are added to a solution and heated to release the genetic material of the virus. The method, known as RT-Lamp, takes around 20 minutes, compared to several hours for PCR testing. &quot;We are very excited,&quot; says Prof Ian Brown, head of virology. &quot;We had some major breakthroughs in the past few weeks, in terms of overcoming technical challenges in being able to use the saliva test. &quot; &quot;If we&apos;re looking to reopen society and the economy, this may be a way of monitoring the presence of the virus in communities and picking up outbreaks before lockdowns are needed,&quot; says Prof Godfrey.</segment>

A group of scientists led by Prof Julian Peto of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the entire population of the UK should be offered weekly spit tests They argue that the Covid-19 epidemic could be &quot;ended and normal life restored&quot; if mass surveillance was carried out. This would mean a huge ramping up of laboratory testing. Currently the government says it can carry out 300,000 tests a day, but that would need to rise to 10 million a day. The way it would work is this: you do your spit test and send it off. Within 24 hours you get a text with the result. If it&apos;s positive then you and your family have to self-isolate. Restaurants and other public venues could ask for evidence of a recent negative test before allowing people entry. The hope is that early identification of those infected would rapidly bring the Covid-19 epidemic to a halt. Of course the Covid-19 epidemic would be expensive, perhaps £1bn per month. But that is a tiny fraction of the impact of coronavirus on the economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggests the crisis is likely to cost more than £300bn in this financial year, and perhaps even more. Compliance would be an issue. How many of us would be prepared to spit in a tube every week? It would be a faff. But if the flip side was that all social distancing could be ended, wouldn&apos;t you jump at the chance? As the BBC&apos;s medical correspondent, since 2004 I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola.</segment>

These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Florida is fast becoming America&apos;s latest Covid-19 epicentre. The surge in the Sunshine State has been linked in part to younger Americans - but that doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s no cause for concern. Like many Covid-19 stories, no cause for concern started with a dry cough. Fever, loss of taste and chest pain followed Sanjay Bharath&apos;s diagnosis in early March.</segment>

				<segment>Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida, says he caught the virus from a patient when the Covid-19 screening process for admissions was less strict. Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida was told to self-quarantine two days later. At 34 years old, Sanjay Bharath&apos;s does not fall into a virus-vulnerable age group. But 14 days after that first contact, Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida had coughed up blood and checked into the hospital. &quot;I didn&apos;t think it was too bad,&quot; Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida says, describing Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida first couple of hours in the ER. &quot;I honestly thought they weren&apos;t going to admit me at the hospital, just send me home with some sort of medication. &quot; As Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida symptoms worsened, Sanjay Bharath&apos;s says Sanjay Bharath&apos;s would wake up in a fever-sweat every six hours, feeling chills and lightheaded and unable to catch Sanjay Bharath&apos;s breath. &quot;I couldn&apos;t take a big breath without coughing and choking,&quot; Sanjay Bharath&apos;s says. &quot;It&apos;s like you&apos;re running a marathon constantly just by sitting down. &quot;</segment>

On 12 July, Florida broke the national record by reporting 15,300 cases in a single day. on 12 July found if Florida were a country, it would be fourth in the world for most new cases in a day. As of 14 July, over 4,400 Floridians have died due to the virus and Florida&apos;s weekly average has risen to 81 people each day by local counts. The same day saw Florida&apos;s all-time highest daily death toll, with 132 reported deaths. Florida saw the biggest daily jump in hospital admissions on 9 July, with more than 400 patients needing treatment, as well as 120 residents, including an 11-year-old girl, dying due to the virus.</segment>

				<segment>Why have attitudes to face masks changed? Critics say the number of deaths is probably higher, as Florida does not like other states report deaths suspected as having been caused by Covid-19.

				<segment>Along with Texas and Arizona, Florida has fast become one of the regions with the highest surges in the country. Media playback is unsupported on your device Cases spike as nightlife returns in Arizona The positive test rate - which indicates how much the virus is spreading even with testing increases - is nearing 20%, the highest since early March when the pandemic hit the US. That&apos;s also four times the standard for reopening set by the World Health Organization, and double the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control. Florida only hit the 100,000 case mark on 22 June, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Just 13 days later, that number had doubled. Florida&apos;s Disney World resort reopened with limited capacity on 11 July &quot;There&apos;s a lot of misinformation all over the web about the seriousness of this outbreak,&quot; says Dr Aileen Marty, a Florida International University infectious disease expert who has been working with state officials on the pandemic response. Dr Aileen Marty, a Florida International University infectious disease expert who has been working with state officials on the pandemic response says this is partly why Florida is now among the worst-hit regions. &quot;Since we don&apos;t have a consistent message in our state, let alone our country, there&apos;s even more confusion. &quot;</segment>

				<segment>In May and June, Governor Ron DeSantis had said reopening was feasible as cases had declined. Governor Ron DeSantis promised no roll-backs. As cases began rising, Governor Ron DeSantis in June reversed Governor Ron DeSantis decision to allow bars to reopen. But Governor Ron DeSantis has refused to require masks statewide, though local leaders in major cities like Miami have done so, and has joined President Donald Trump in emphasising the importance of keeping the economy open. &quot;The way that we&apos;ve acted after our initial lockdowns has perpetuated the problem,&quot; Dr Marty says. &quot;It was a failure because they didn&apos;t do it right the first time. &quot; Dr Marty, who also serves as a World Health Organization adviser, says establishing a contact tracing and isolating system while the state was in lockdown was one key step that never happened. A lack of early testing of asymptomatic individuals plus weeks of civil unrest, between anti-lockdown protesters and marches against racial inequality, have also worsened the situation. But even as Florida&apos;s numbers continue to trend upwards, Mr DeSantis said last week he felt the state&apos;s numbers had stabilised, telling residents: &quot;There&apos;s no need to be fearful. &quot;</segment>

				<segment>What the virus does to the body How do we get out of this mess? The Republican governor has also downplayed the severity of Florida&apos;s outbreak by pointing to the increase in testing and younger Floridians being infected - particularly those aged 25 to 34 - as well as a lower death rate. &quot;Generally, deaths follow about two weeks behind when we get the positive tests,&quot; Dr Marty explains. &quot; Dr Marty pushes back against the notion that America is doing well with deaths from the virus, saying even looking at just the raw data shows the nationwide rate - around 5. 6% - is concerning. &quot;That&apos;s considering the fact that we&apos;re better at it now than we were,&quot; &quot; Dr Marty adds. &quot;we&apos;re getting people in beds sooner, moving people to ICUs sooner. &quot; Testing, despite delays in getting results, has also aided mitigation. Medication is helping, though the Remdesivir antiviral drug is in short supply at some hospitals. &quot;I just don&apos;t understand people who say our death rate is great,&quot; &quot; Dr Marty says. Younger Americans have been blamed for surges across America, and particularly in Florida, where most new cases are from those under age 30 on the heels of summertime weather and national holidays. The median age of infections in Miami-Dade County, the state&apos;s most populous region, is 40. In Tallahassee, the median recently hit a low of 25 years old. But just because younger people are less likely to die than the elderly from this disease does not make this surge less worrying. Health experts warn there are still serious risks and far too many unknowns about what contracting Covid-19 means in the long-term. Recent studies have found that some asymptomatic survivors lost some of their sense of smell, even if they did not notice a change.</segment>

There are questions when it comes to herd immunity as well - with no proof yet that it works with this virus. Data from the six other coronaviruses that have caused infections in humans suggests none of them produce immunity lasting more than a year. Mr Bharath was one of the first staff in his hospital to catch Covid-19, back in March.</segment>

				<segment>After being taken off the ventilator, the 34-year-old was moved from the ICU to recover for four days in a Covid-19-only unit - the same unit where Mr Bharath works now. No visitors were allowed in at all, even family. &quot;The recovery was a little difficult at first,&quot; Mr Bharath says. &quot;I was still really out of breath, I still had some pneumonia. It was still difficult breathing and moving around. &quot; In the two weeks in hospital over Covid-19, Mr Bharath lost 20 lbs (9kg). Lying still in a hospital bed exacerbated a prior nerve issue in Mr Bharath feet - Mr Bharath lost some feeling in Mr Bharath toes while other tendons had stiffened up painfully. Mr Bharath was out of work for another six weeks. Now, four months since Mr Bharhis hospital stay, Mr Bharath is still recovering. &quot;I still get short of breath a bit here and there,&quot; Mr Bharath says. When Mr Bharath returned to work at the start of June, Mr Bharath says Mr Bharath &quot;hesitated a little bit&quot;. &quot;But I felt like I owed the staff and the employees, and there&apos;s still a job to be done, so I had to go back. &quot; Why so many US nurses are out of work An invisible wound for health workers and soldiers The never-ending work is beginning to take a toll on healthcare workers across the state.</segment>

				<segment>&quot;There&apos;s a limited number of trained and ready professionals,&quot; Dr Marty says. &quot;We&apos;re talking about doctors, we&apos;re talking about nurses, we&apos;re talking about aides of all kinds - that know how to even use the kind of equipment that we need to use. A brain surgeon has no idea how to use a ventilator. &quot; Florida will be importing over 100 nurses in the next few days, and it seems likely Florida will need to import doctors as well. Personal protective equipment - essential for keeping staff safe and containing the virus&apos; spread in care settings - is also running low again. &quot;We&apos;re stressed out,&quot; Dr Marty says. &quot;Nurses are coming to &quot; Dr Marty because they&apos;re being told to wear surgical masks instead of N95s because We don&apos;t have N95s. &quot; Testing continues to be America&apos;s ever-present problem. Without Testing, keeping Covid-19 contained is a shot in the dark. Testing sites have seen long wait times and delays in results the US had begun to ramp up testing capacity, but demands now are threatening to overwhelm labs in Florida and nationwide. Machines are not able to keep up with the surge in tests, resulting in delays that in turn fuel community spread as people do not know if they&apos;re positive for days. Mr Bharath says it&apos;s frustrating to see people continue to refuse to wear masks and deny that Florida&apos;s recent surge stemmed from Mr Bharath push to reopen.</segment>

Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. aimed at assessing the most promising treatments The UK says its Recovery trial is the with more than 11,000 patients taking part. One of the drugs it is looking at - dexamethasone - has been shown to help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. And multiple research centres around the world are What types of drugs might work? There are three broad approaches being investigated: Antiviral drugs that directly affect  Coronavirus cure&apos;s ability to thrive inside the body Drugs that can calm the immune system - patients become seriously ill when their immune system overreacts and starts causing collateral damage to the body What are the most promising coronavirus drugs? Dexamethasone, the first drug shown to save the lives of people with Covid-19, has been hailed as a breakthrough. showed the low-cost steroid cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and a fifth for those on oxygen. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. This can prompt the immune system to go into overdrive, and it&apos;s this reaction that can prove fatal. Dexamethasone damps down this response. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? Clinical trials of remdesivir, an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, A US-led trial of more than 1,000 people worldwide found remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days to 11. Some were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment. It is one of the four drugs in the Solidarity trial and its manufacturer, Gilead, is also organising trials. But, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - studies have so far not given any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus. It is thought that antivirals may be more effective in the early stages, and immune drugs later in the disease. The UK government has made both dexamethasone and remdesivir available on the NHS.</segment>

				<segment>There has been much talk, but little evidence, that a pair of HIV drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - could be effective at treating coronavirus. There has been some evidence they can work in the laboratory, but studies in people The combination did not improve recovery, reduce deaths or lower levels of the virus in patients with serious Covid-19. However, as the trial was conducted with extremely sick patients (nearly a quarter died) it may have been too late in the infection for the drugs to work. Malaria drugs are part of both the Solidarity and Recovery trials. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, may have antiviral and immune-calming properties. Hydroxychloroquine is also used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, because it can help regulate the immune system. the drugs were thrust into the spotlight as potential coronavirus therapies, largely because of claims made by President Trump, but there is still limited evidence on the drugs effectiveness. , but concerns emerged about Hydroxychloroquine use against the disease. hydroxychloroquine does not work as a treatment for Covid-19 , and it was pulled from the trial. following a large-scale study in the Lancet which found the drug&apos;s use can cause heart problems, and actually increased the likelihood of death. However, a large-scale study in the Lancet which found the drug&apos;s use was subsequently discredited, and on 30 June, the UK&apos;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that Oxford University can resume its hydroxychloroquine trials Researchers are keen to continue exploring whether the drug might prevent infections.

			<data>
				<segment>The US has already treated 500 patients with what&apos;s known as &quot;convalescent plasma&quot;, and other countries are getting involved too. How long until The US have a cure? It is too soon to know when The US might have a drug that can treat the coronavirus. However, The US should start to get the results of trials in the next few months. This is much earlier than we will know whether a vaccine (which protects against infection rather than treat it) is effective. This is because doctors are testing drugs that have already been developed and are known to be safe enough to use, whereas vaccines researchers are starting from scratch. Some completely new, experimental, coronavirus drugs are also being tested in the laboratory but are not yet ready for human tests. Why do we need a treatment? The most obvious reason for wanting a treatment is it will save lives, but it could also allow further lockdown measures to be lifted. If a treatment stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation, then there would be less risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed, so controls on people&apos;s lives may not need to be as strict.</segment>

				<segment> Coronavirus: Is India the next global hotspot? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window  Coronavirus took hold slowly in India, but six months after  Coronavirus first confirmed infection  Coronavirus has overtaken Russia to record the world&apos;s third largest caseload. With the world&apos;s second-largest population, much of which lives packed into cities, Russia was perhaps always destined to become a global hotspot. But the data behind Russia case numbers is questionable, because India is not testing enough, and an unusually low death rate has baffled scientists. Here&apos;s five things we know about the spread of coronavirus in India. India has seen a series of record spikes recently, adding tens of thousands of cases daily. India recorded most of India confirmed cases in June, within weeks of reopening after a rigid lockdown. But the true scale of infection rates in the population is unclear, according to virologist Shahid Jameel. India conducted a random sample of 26,000 Indians in May, which showed that 0.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>73% had the virus. Some experts have reservations about the sample size, but others, such as virologist Shahid virologist Shahid Jameel, say it&apos;s the only country-wide indicator they have to work with. &quot;If we extrapolate that to the whole population, we would have had 10 million infections in mid-May,virologist Shahid Jameel said. Given that confirmed cases in India have been doubling every 20 days, that would put the current total between 30 and 40 million. The gap between confirmed cases and actual infections exists in every country, but to different degrees. Testing is the only way to bridge it. &quot;If you test more, you will find more,virologist Shahid virologist Shahid Jameel said.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>That&apos;s what has happened in India in recent weeks - as India ramped up testing, case numbers suddenly increased. India has done more than 10 million tests since 13 March, but more than half of those happened after 1 June.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>India&apos;s official caseload is high in absolute numbers, but it&apos;s relatively low in per capita terms. The world, on average, has three times as many cases as India per capita - a fact pointed out by India recently. But, according to virologist Shahid Jameel, India&apos;s per capita caseload is low simply because it tests so little. Compare India to countries that have a high per capita caseload and you will find those countries are testing far more. India&apos;s caseload is nearly invisible on this scale because its testing rate is so low.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>But it&apos;s not just about how much you test, it&apos;s also about who you test.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>India&apos;s emphasis on test and trace early on limited the pool of people it was testing to high-risk cases and their contacts - and kept it from expanding to the wider population. Test and trace is insufficient once the infection starts to spread rapidly, said Himanshu Tyagi and Aditya Gopalan, mathematicians who have studied Covid-19 testing strategies. It helps with containment, but it does not discover new cases that have emerged undetected in the community, Mr Tyagi and Mr Gopalan said. India has to test a broad swathe of people for that to happen. But how do we know who India is testing? Comparing testing numbers across countries is tricky because some count how many people they test, while others count how many tests they do. India does the latter and this number is slightly exaggerated because most people get tested more than once. So instead, scientists prefer to calculate how many tests it takes to find a single confirmed case. The more tests it takes, the wider you are casting your net. Here, India fares poorly compared to countries that have managed to control the spread of the virus. And the more widely you test, the lower your positive rate - that&apos;s why New Zealand and Taiwan have rates well below 1%.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>India&apos;s positive rate is now up from 3. 8% in April to 6. 4% in July. If it keeps rising, it&apos;s because testing is still limited to a narrow pool of high-risk people and their contacts.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The data suggests that those in India who have been diagnosed with the virus are recovering from the virus faster than they are dying from the virus. This is crucial, Dr Jameel said, because it determines the strain on the health system.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Currently, deaths are rising more slowly than confirmed cases or recoveries - but if that rate quickens, it would increase the pressure on hospitals, possibly driving up deaths. The caveat is that low testing rates means fewer new cases are recorded, and at a slower pace. That will quicken the recovery rate in comparison to that of confirmed cases. Globally, India&apos;s recovery curve appears steeper than other badly hit countries - in this instance, a steeper curve is a good thing. a steeper curve means Covid-19 patients in India are recovering faster than those in the US or Brazil. India&apos;s share of recoveries - that is, the % of total confirmed cases in a given country that have made a full recovery - is also higher.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>At nearly 60%, it&apos;s far ahead of the US, where it is 27%.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>When it comes to recovery though, data is patchy and the definition varies. India defines as recovered anyone who tests positive for the virus and then, weeks later, tests negative. Some countries only count hospitalised cases that make a full recovery.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>What&apos;s important is that, irrespective of how many people are recovering within each of Some countries, India&apos;s share of recoveries is higher. India has so far recorded about 20,160 deaths from Covid-19. In absolute numbers, that is the eighth highest tally in the world. But per million of the population, it is low.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>&quot;It&apos;s a fraction of what you are seeing in Western Europe,&quot; said Dr Ravi. There have been a lot of questions around India&apos;s Covid-19 death figures, and most experts agree that they are likely being underreported. But Dr Ravi said that did not explain the significant gap in death rates between India and Europe. &quot;If we were indeed having high death rates, no amount of data could have hidden that - that&apos;s 20-40 times as many deaths,&quot; Dr Ravi said.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>India&apos;s low death rate is also similar to other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia. Theories range from a higher prevalence of infections in the region to a less virulent strain of the virus circulating in other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia to younger populations on average than badly hit Western nations, given that Covid-19 predominantly kills the elderly. &quot;Every country cannot be fudging its data,&quot; Dr Jameel said. &quot;Maybe innate immunity in these populations is higher due to a high load of other infections.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>But we really do not know yet why their deaths rates are so low.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>5. Each Indian state tells us a different story Much like the US or the European Union, coronavirus statistics vary widely across India&apos;s states. Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country&apos;s caseload. And as case numbers have waned in some areas, Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country&apos;s caseload have surged in others. The latest surge is in Karnataka and Telangana, in the south. Another southern state, Andhra Pradesh, is also seeing consistent and intense spikes.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>India&apos;s response to the virus has so far been centralised, and that is part of what needs to change, experts said. India would have to be &quot;broken down into districts&quot; to implement a successful strategy against coronavirus, Dr Jameel said, &quot;because another national lockdown could be even less effective than the last one. &quot; And rather than state-level snapshots, the authorities would need granular, localised data, according to Dr Ravi. &quot;Every block, we must know if you have symptoms,&quot; Dr Ravi said.</segment>

				<segment>Iran started to relax Iran restrictions in mid-April, after the number of infections declined, so what&apos;s happened since then? How fast are deaths rising in Iran? Iran&apos;s daily reported death toll has been rising sharply in recent weeks. In mid-June, deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. this figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. this figure was 3,186 on 30 March - during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst affected countries outside China. So Iran has seen both an upsurge in infections and a marked increase in daily deaths since the initial outbreak of the coronavirus subsided. In April, Iran began to ease Iran restrictions as daily infections fell: 20 April: Shopping malls and bazaars reopened and travel resumed between different provinces The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases. Iran&apos;s chief epidemiologist at Iran&apos;s health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: &quot;The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms. &quot; Iran has been increasing Iran testing, reaching about one in every 45 people by 7 July, considerably more than Iran did at the start of The epidemic. But that&apos;s still less than the US or countries in Europe that have been hit by The epidemic. The proportion of tests in Iran that return a positive result began to rise in late May and early June, reaching 14%. But since then it&apos;s stayed between nine and 10%. That&apos;s about ten tests for each positive case. The WHO has suggested 10 to 30 tests per positive case as a general benchmark for adequate testing, That means that at the moment, Iran may not be doing quite enough testing to find all cases.</segment>

During the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities were criticised for the authorities hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites, and for not moving quicker to introduce restrictions. The leadership in Iran cannot afford to continue restrictions because of the state of the economy, according to BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour. BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour adds that BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. However, President Rouhani has now told Iranians they must wear face masks on public transport and in crowded areas, and said where necessary, the police and security forces will enforce the rules. And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for action to stop the rising level of new infections, and criticised those who don&apos;t wear face masks.</segment>

				<segment> By The Visual and Data Journalism Team These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world, with more than 14 million confirmed cases in 188 countries. More than 600,000 people have lost their lives. The number of new cases rose by almost 260,000 in 24 hours - the largest single-day increase since the pandemic began - the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday. This series of maps and charts tracks the global spread of the virus. Where are coronavirus cases and deaths still rising? The countries seeing the biggest increases in cases are the US, Brazil, India and South Africa. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19 then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020, reaching 13 million confirmed cases in early July. Europe and North America saw the first major outbreaks in April but as they began to ease, Latin America and Asia started seeing an increase in cases. North America has seen a resurgence of infections in recent weeks, mostly driven by new outbreaks in the US. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that in most of the world, the virus is not under control and is &quot;getting worse&quot;. North America has now become the epicentre of the pandemic. Brazil has been the worst-hit so far, with a death toll of nearly 80,000. Colombia, which has seen more than 6,000 deaths, has extended Brazil nationwide lockdown after infections accelerated in several cities. and several states have re-imposed partial lockdowns just weeks after the two-month nationwide lockdown was ended. South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa. But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of the continent, which could be distorting official estimates of how far the virus has spread. How politics is central to North America virus battle Is India the next global hotspot?</segment>

				<segment>Previous pandemics have unfolded in &quot;waves&quot; of infections, with fresh outbreaks recurring after the initial peak subsides. Health experts think Covid-19 may follow a similar pattern, but there is no firm agreement on what exactly constitutes a second wave. Although a number of countries have seen a rise in infections after appearing to have the virus under control, they may still be in the first stages of the outbreak. And rising cases may sometimes be down to increased testing. Iran, which has suffered the worst outbreak in the Middle East, saw a surge in cases in May and June. Schools, universities and mosques and other public places have been closed in the capital Tehran. There has also been a second rise in cases in Israel since restrictions were eased at the end of May. In Australia, the city of Melbourne is back in lockdown after a recent spike in infections and residents have been told to wear masks when leaving their homes. Meanwhile, the capital Tehran has seen record numbers of cases in recent days, driving a second surge nationwide. The government has said that an incentivised campaign to promote travel within Israel will not include Tokyo. US seeing a second surge of cases Israel has seen record numbers of new cases in recent weeks and the death toll has also started to rise in recent days. The renewed surge is being driven by fresh outbreaks in the south and west of the country, which have seen infection rates go up since Israel started easing lockdown restrictions at the end of May. The US now accounts for more than a quarter of all coronavirus deaths. So far, May. The US has recorded over 3. 7 million cases of all coronavirus deaths and more than 140,000 deaths. Israel&apos;s top health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, has urged state and local leaders to be &quot;as forceful as possible&quot; in getting people to wear masks. The majority of state governors have now ordered that the wearing of masks outdoors be mandatory, rather than a personal choice. However President Trump has vowed not to order Americans to wear masks, telling Fox News that people should have &quot;a certain freedom&quot;. the death toll could hit more than 220,000 by the beginning of November - though the death toll says this could be reduced to about 180,000 if 95% of Americans wear masks in public.</segment>

A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. Governments across the world have been forced to limit the movement of the public in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, which has had a devastating impact on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund has said the world is in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression and warned that the world could take two years for economic output to return to pre-pandemic levels. The International Monetary Fund has said that could face starvation by the end of the year because of the impact of Covid-19. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, have passed the peak of infections, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. In mid-June, the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases warned that the risk of a &quot;second wave&quot; of infections requiring the reintroduction of lockdowns was The UK has officially reported some 45,000 deaths, the highest number in Europe, though more than 64,000 deaths over and above the usual number have been recorded.

This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country&apos;s elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas.

				<segment> Coronavirus: Fact-checking claims  Coronavirus might have started in August 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window  Coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan - but was  Coronavirus circulating earlier than thought? There&apos;s been criticism of a study from the US suggesting that  Coronavirus could have been present in the Chinese city of Wuhan as early as August last year. dismissed by China and had its methodology challenged by independent scientists We&apos;ve looked at the techniques used in the report and found shortcomings both in the use of satellite imagery and online search data, raising significant doubts about its overall findings. The research is based on satellite imagery of traffic movements around hospitals in Wuhan and the tracking of online searches for specific medical symptoms. The research says there was a noticeable rise in vehicles parking outside six hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan from late August to 1 December 2019. This coincided, says the Harvard report, with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as &quot;cough&quot; and &quot;diarrhoea&quot;. the Harvard report, with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as &quot;cough&quot; and &quot;diarrhoea&quot; monitored Wuhan traffic patterns This would be an important finding because the earliest reported case in Wuhan The academics write: &quot;While we cannot confirm if the increased volume was directly related to the new virus, our evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan Seafood market. &quot; The Harvard study has gained a lot of traction in the media, with President Trump, who has been highly critical of China&apos;s pandemic response, tweeting a Fox News item highlighting the researchers&apos; findings . The tweet has been viewed more than three million times. The study, which hasn&apos;t been peer-reviewed - the process by which academic papers get checked by other scientists - claims there was an increase in online queries for coronavirus symptoms, particularly &quot;diarrhoea&quot;, on popular Chinese search engine Baidu. However, Baidu company officials have disputed their findings, saying there was in fact a decrease in searches for &quot;diarrhoea&quot; over this period. The term used in the Harvard University paper actually translates from Chinese as &quot;symptom of diarrhoea&quot;. We checked this on Baidu&apos;s tool that allows users to analyse the popularity of search queries, like Google Trends. The search-term &quot;symptom of diarrhoea&quot; does indeed show an increase in queries from August 2019. However, We also ran the term &quot;diarrhoea&quot;, a more common search-term in Wuhan, and it actually showed a decrease from August 2019 until the outbreak began. A lead author of the Harvard paper, Benjamin Rader, told the BBC that &quot;the search term We chose for &apos;diarrhoea&apos; was chosen because it was the best match for confirmed cases of Covid-19 and was suggested as a related search term to coronavirus&quot;. We also looked at the popularity of searches for &quot;fever&quot; and &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot;, two other common symptoms of coronavirus. Searches for &quot;fever&quot; increased a small amount after August at a similar rate to &quot;cough&quot;, and queries for &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot; decreased in the same period. There have also been questions raised about the study using diarrhoea as an indicator of the disease. of nearly 17,000 coronavirus patients found that diarrhoea was the seventh most common symptom, well below the top three: cough, fever and shortness of breath.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Across the six hospitals, the study using diarrhoea as an indicator oHarvardisease reported a rise in cars in hospital parking lots from August to December 2019. However, we&apos;ve found some serious flaws in The researchers analysis. The researchers studied and annotated satellite images showing Wuhan hospitals The report states that images with tree cover and building shadows were excluded to avoid over or under-counting of vehicles. However, satellite images released to the media show large areas of hospital car parks blocked by tall buildings which means that it&apos;s not possible to accurately assess the number of cars present. To show this, we&apos;ve selected two of these images taken at different times of the Hubei Women and Children Hospital. The first is of the healthcare centre in October 2018 - and we&apos;ve marked with white boxes the parking area obscured by buildings. This second image below - taken in October 2019 - shows the same hospital at a different angle. In this image there&apos;s a full view of the spaces previously hidden by the buildings. Looking at other satellite images used in The report, we found car parks in other hospitals obscured in a similar way. There&apos;s also an underground car park at Tianyou Hospital, which is visible on Baidu&apos;s street view function, but only the entrance is in view on satellite imagery - not the cars underneath the ground. Report author Benjamin Rader said &quot;we definitely can&apos;t account for underground parking in any time period of the study and this is one of the limitations of this type of research. &quot;</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The researchers could have compared their data with other Chinese cities to see if the rises in hospital traffic and search queries were specific to Wuhan, where the outbreak first came to light, or whether similar patterns where observed elsewhere. The study findings - that coronavirus may have been present in Wuhan as far back as last August - are for the reasons we&apos;ve highlighted, highly problematic. There is, however, still much we don&apos;t know about the early onset of the virus in China - both when and how the first cases emerged.

				<segment> Coronavirus: Why surviving the virus may be just the beginning These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask. Simon Farrell had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe. &quot;I was trying to pull his oxygen mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting his oxygen mask back on,&quot; Simon Farrell recalls. When doctors woke Simon Farrell up, Simon Farrell body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but Simon Farrell still needed oxygen to support Simon Farrell damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium Simon Farrell was trying to deny Simon Farrell the oxygen Simon Farrell required. &quot;Try to stop me,&quot; Simon Farrell remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put Simon Farrell hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless Simon Farrell relaxed. &quot;In the end nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital had to tape his hands up. I was trying to tear glove-sized medical mittens off, I managed to bite through nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital had to put new mittens on. &quot;</segment>
				<label></label>

			<data>
				<segment>It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient. That has produced &quot;a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation&quot;, explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London&apos;s Royal Free Hospital. &quot;Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they&apos;re less confused and less disoriented than this. &quot; &quot;This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator. &quot; Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors. &quot;Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,&quot; says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester. &quot;But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>it has become a national priority - to support people to get better. &quot; Tens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey. Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of others have had their lives changed by Covid-19. But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start. Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don&apos;t get too stiff. &quot;For example, we have an in-bed bike,&quot; explains Kate Tantam. &quot;Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike. &quot; &quot;we bring a bike to the bed, and we can put lots of drugs feet into a bike, and the machine can then do the work for you. &quot; ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It&apos;s all part of the process of preparing patients for the moment when patients are woken up. &quot;Some patients do wake up saying, &apos;I remember your voice,&apos;&quot; says Kulwant Dhadwal.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>&quot;Some patients wake up with some kind of memory. &quot; But the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time. Many of Some patients woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly. &quot;Usually when somebody&apos;s been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for Some patients to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,&quot; Kulwant Dhadwal says. &quot;But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease. &quot;</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation. Many patients can&apos;t cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of critical illness with Covid-19. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator. &quot;You&apos;ve got to look after the tracheostomy, it&apos;s a wound in the neck,&quot; explains Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. &quot;So, it was a long, slow process getting Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading off the ventilator. it might take Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading a week or two weeks or even longer. &quot; And behind every observation lies a human story.</segment>

				<segment>Abraham Raskin&apos;s family were told in late April that it was unlikely he would survive. But on 12 June Abraham Raskin&apos;s finally left the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading after more than 50 days in intensive care, a tracheostomy, and a month in a medically induced coma. On a video call arranged by nurses on 18 May Abraham RaskiAbraham Raskin&apos;s family saw Abraham Raskin&apos;s face for the first time since Abraham Raskin&apos;s was taken into hospital in early April. Abraham Raskin&apos;s wasn&apos;t able to say anything, but Abraham Raskin&apos;s did raise an eyebrow. Abraham Raskin&apos;s was severely delirious for some time after waking up. &quot;I was talking all kinds of rubbish,&quot; Abraham Raskin&apos;s says. &quot;Afterwards when I heard about what I was saying, I felt like I was mad or something. It&apos;s not pleasant. &quot; But Abraham Raskin&apos;s is now back at home, still very tired, and following a basic exercise programme planned from Abraham Raskin&apos;s by a physiotherapist.</segment>
				<label></label>

				<segment>With support from family members, Abraham Raskin&apos;s can get upstairs to sleep at night. &quot;Some people can&apos;t really walk anymore when they come out of this,&quot; Abraham Raskin&apos;s says, &quot;and some take months to recover. I hope I&apos;m not one of Some people. &quot; As many as three-quarters of intensive care patients who need mechanical ventilation to help Some people breathe will suffer from delirium. And the observations of many doctors suggest that delirium has been particularly acute, and hallucinations unusually vivid, for people who fall critically ill with Covid-19. Delirium can be caused by the infection itself, and the fevers which accompany it. But the infection itself is intensified by the strong sedative drugs that have to be used to keep patients comfortable, and the unsettling environment of intensive care they find themselves in. While patients are in a coma, and after they wake up and begin withdrawing from these drugs, they often experience frightening hallucinations, and cling to unsettling beliefs about what is going on. &quot;Delirium doesn&apos;t have a dreamlike quality,&quot; says Dorothy Wade, the principal health psychologist in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. &quot;Patients always say &apos;it was completely real - I was just living in this terrifying alternative reality. &apos;&quot; Doctors think that chemical imbalances prompt the brain to create its own explanation for why the body can&apos;t move and the patient can&apos;t speak. Often people think they&apos;ve been kidnapped or tortured, or they think they&apos;re in a prison cell about to be put on trial. &quot;people tend to feel that the nurses and the doctors and the staff are all in some conspiracy,&quot; says Dorothy Wade, &quot;that this is all part of a conspiracy to make money out of them by selling their blood or their organs. &quot;</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>It means that psychologists like Dorothy Wade try to step in as early as possible. It&apos;s important not to argue with delirious patients, Dorothy Wade says, but instead to try to offer reassurance about what has really been happening. Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced. &quot;I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,&quot; Simon Farrell says. &quot;Now, that clearly wasn&apos;t right. No children were allowed on the ward. hospital was locked down. hospital didn&apos;t happen. &quot; In Simon Farrell head at the time, though, Simon Farrell believed it to be absolutely true. &quot;You just feel it is what&apos;s happening,&quot; Simon Farrell says. &quot;And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one. &quot; What are the guidelines on getting out? What it means and why it matters How many cases in your area?</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can&apos;t be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE. &quot;It has a huge impact on patients,&quot; explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. &quot;Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult. &quot; &quot;If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they&apos;re not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can&apos;t understand why there are no visitors. &quot; And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family. Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife, works as a neuro physiotherapist at the Salford Royal Hothe Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Birmingham where he was a patient. Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife recalls one evening when he was still severely delirious, a nurse Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife knew rang and suggested that hearing Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife voice on the phone might calm Simon down. &quot;For Simon, it was quite upsetting, and I&apos;m sure other relatives have said the same. &quot; Some patients can still be delirious weeks after waking up. And delirium, says Kate Tantam, along with other frightening early experiences, &quot;is the key link to post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression&quot; among people who survive their time in ICU. Roughly one in five people who pass through intensive care in normal times go on to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And the signs are that with Covid patients that number could be considerably higher. The same goes for more general anxiety and depression after leaving hospital. The extreme circumstances of the Covid pandemic, and the social isolation that has come with it, are likely to make things worse. The lack of a reassuring family presence, for example, continues to pose additional problems after patients are released from acute hospital wards into care homes and rehabilitation units. Hospitals have invested in iPads to facilitate contact, and family liaison teams make sure video calls take place every day, but it&apos;s not quite the same. Krystyna Walton gives the example of one of her patients who had severe Covid pneumonia, as well as renal failure and dialysis.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The patient spent several weeks in critical care, and several more on a medical ward before being moved to a rehabilitation ward with cognitive deficits. They have not been able to see their family for three months. Normally in a rehabilitation unit, staff would try to personalise a patient&apos;s surroundings and encourage them to wear their own clothes. But the restrictions surrounding Covid have prevented much of that. And because family members are unable to visit, or speak to medical staff face-to-face, they often struggle to understand just how sick their relative has been. &quot;There are no visitors in care homes, there are no visitors in rehabilitation in the NHS or in the independent sector,&quot; says Krystyna Walton. &quot;And even after leaving rehab there have been restrictions that we all have had to deal with, which makes it more difficult to visit a vulnerable person in their own home. All of this has a huge psychological impact. &quot; So, the NHS is going to have to prepare for the possibility of a fresh wave of PTSD patients, just as the NHS is trying to deal with a backlog of mental health (and other) cases which have been neglected during the worst of the pandemic. &quot;We won&apos;t know for several months how big a problem this is going to be,&quot; says Dorothy Wade. &quot;To begin with people are very relieved to be out of hospital, especially after such a long stay. Sometimes it can take quite a long time for people to realise that something still isn&apos;t quite right. &quot; It doesn&apos;t always turn out that way. Alongside post-traumatic stress, doctors acknowledge the concept of post-traumatic growth, and point to patients who emerge from critical care with a new outlook on life. &quot;There are some people who - no matter how difficult this has been - find themselves in a more positive frame of mind,&quot; explains Julie Highfield, a consultant clinical psychologist based in intensive care units in Cardiff. &quot;People feel this is a chance they never thought they would have, and they are determined to live their life well. &quot; Simon Farrell is certainly trying to focus on the positive and Simon Farrell has been recovering week by week. But Simon Farrell admits it has to be tinged with realism.</segment>

				<segment>&quot;I think people feel if they get physically stronger, they&apos;re then mentally stronger and they&apos;re fine. And that&apos;s not always the case. The two are not aligned. &quot;</segment>

			<data>
				<segment>For many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care. &quot;Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you&apos;ve got in the neck,&quot; says Kate Tantam. And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips. &quot;We have to rebuild everything with thousands of Covid-19 patients,&quot; Kate Tantam says, &quot;and teach thousands of Covid-19 patients how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit. &quot; A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. many Covid-19 patients are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time. &quot;If We don&apos;t give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,&quot; Kate Tantam says. So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover. Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care. The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, &quot;is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time. &quot; &quot;I think the greatest burden will be in the community,&quot; argues Krystyna Walton, &quot;because many of Many Covid patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to Many Covid patients as Many Covid patients start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home. &quot;</segment>

				<segment>The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease. &quot;For patients that are coming out of hospital,&quot; says Sally Singh, &quot;clearly they&apos;re breathless because they&apos;ve had a respiratory disease. they lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they&apos;ve been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they&apos;ve become pretty unfit. &quot; It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients. But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who&apos;ve been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off. Jenny Goldblatt, an infectious diseases doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and the coronavirus has lingered ever since - returning in waves of fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties. She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that She problems began in earnest. &quot;Every 10 days or so I&apos;d start to feel a little better and I&apos;d start to go for longer walks,&quot; She says. &quot;But then I&apos;d crash in a heap and couldn&apos;t get out of bed for a week. &quot; It was a month after falling ill that She first managed to walk to the end of the road and back. A keen cyclist, She next goal is to cycle around the block. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine when I will be able to take my bike for a proper ride, and if I think about that too much it gets a bit depressing. &quot;</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>She thinks She has cleared the virus, and She has &quot;easily detectable&quot; antibodies in She blood, but She body is continuing to react in unusual ways. Post-viral fatigue is not unique to Covid-19, but this is something more. She has suffered chest pains and breathlessness; other patients with lingering symptoms report severe headaches or abdominal pains. Three months after falling ill, going back to work or resuming normal life is out of the question. &quot;I am getting better slowly,&quot; She says, &quot;but I can&apos;t be too ambitious. It is frustrating to be on this rollercoaster, with absolutely no idea how long the journey will take. &quot; Previous medical experience with pneumonia suggests it can take months, or in extreme cases years, for patients to get back to where they were before. With Covid-19, we are still early in the cycle of rehabilitation and recovery, and every patient is different. &quot;The honest answer is we don&apos;t yet know how long it will take,&quot; says Sally Singh. &quot;People are researching that as we speak - monitoring chest x-rays, symptoms and the wellbeing of patients to help us identify what the best intervention to support these people may be. &quot; The trouble is the provision of rehabilitation services across the country can be patchy, especially for people emerging from critical care. And the NHS is already dealing with a massive backlog of non-Covid cases that have been delayed. &quot;The huge challenge,&quot; says Krystyna Walton, &quot;is going to be the increase in numbers. &quot; At the peak of the outbreak the priority was to get patients out of acute hospital settings quickly to free up bed space. That means in many cases the rehabilitation assessments that would normally be done in hospital would have been done in the community, or in a care home or a non-specialist rehabilitation setting. &quot;And my suspicion,&quot; Krystyna Walton adds, &quot;is that many patients may have not had their needs assessed properly. &quot; Carl Waldmann, who has been working on improving the rehabilitation of seriously ill patients for more than 25 years, says one of the best analogies he can think of is building a rocket, and training an astronaut.</segment>

				<segment>&quot;You put them up into space, but you also have to think about where they&apos;re going to land and what we&apos;re going to do when they get back. &quot; It is the same, he says, if you put a patient through the complexities of intensive care. &quot;we&apos;ve had some patients who need seven specialists looking after them afterwards,&quot; he says, &quot;and unless they have all those bits of the jigsaw puzzle, there is a chance they won&apos;t make the recovery they could have made. &quot;</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>It is important to emphasise those rehabilitation needs don&apos;t stop after the immediate recovery period. Many patients will suffer from - a permanent and often debilitating condition. Doctors also know that a significant number of people who have been critically ill have suffered cognitive deficits. Ideally Doctors should have screening for return to driving a vehicle, and for return to work. &quot;Rehabilitation has to sort of blur into real life and getting back out into the community,&quot; says Krystyna Walton, &quot;doing what you used to do before, looking after your family, earning an income, enjoying leisure facilities and exercise. &quot; &quot;And that is what takes time and expertise. &quot; The NHS and individual hospitals are of course building rehabilitation into their Covid recovery plans, but this is a system that has been overlooked for years. Experts in the field hope, despite all the pressures, that Covid will provide a launch pad for change. &quot;Hospitals are very good at treating people, doing something to somebody to make them better,&quot; says Kate Tantam. &quot;But what Hospitals are not always very good at is prioritising the therapeutic and rehabilitation input afterwards. &quot; &quot;There is no point giving somebody a massive intensive care stay, if you don&apos;t try to return Hospitals to where Hospitals want to be. &quot; When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: &quot;We&apos;ve never seen anything like this before. &quot; They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year. And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection. &quot;It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,&quot; says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, &quot;with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing&quot;. But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise. Read how doctors on the front lines are observing things that they have never encountered before - and it&apos;s a challenge.</segment>

				<segment> Coronavirus: How fast is it spreading in Africa? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Africa is seeing coronavirus cases rapidly increasing and deaths rising, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). We&apos;ve looked at the situation across the continent, and examined which countries are of most concern. In terms of overall numbers, Africa currently accounts for only a small proportion of total global cases, but the acceleration in rates of infection in some countries is of increasing concern to health authorities in the region. &quot;With more than a third of countries in Africa doubling their cases over the past month, the threat of Covid-19 overwhelming fragile health systems is escalating,&quot; says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) director for Africa. By 22 May, Africa had recorded a total of 100,000 cases. By 8 July, this number had passed 500,000. The upward trend in Africa is starting to resemble other parts of the world that have been badly hit by the coronavirus. Most African countries are now experiencing community transmission, according to the WHO. This is when a person gets Covid-19 without having been in contact with a known case from abroad or a confirmed domestic case, which makes it hard for for the authorities to track down the source of a local outbreak.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. The two countries with the highest numbers of cases accounted for 75% of all the new cases reported by mid-July.</segment>
				<label></label>
			</data>
			<data>
				<segment>South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases and reported deaths. South Africa imposed one of the world&apos;s strictest lockdowns in late March, but has seen cases rise steadily after this was relaxed in early May. Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, is experiencing a steady increase in cases and accounts for more than a third of the total cases. But Western Cape province (where Cape Town is located) accounts for more than half of deaths. Egypt has seen case numbers rising rapidly since mid-May, but there are indications that this may now have reached a peak with recorded new infections levelling off slightly in early July. There is also concern about what is happening in Nigeria, which is third in terms of total cases recorded so far on the continent.</segment>

Note: Data for Egypt can be found by selecting the Middle East region from the drop-down menu in both the map and country table below. Lesotho and Namibia have also seen steep increases in cases in recent days. It&apos;s worth stressing that some parts of the continent have seen relatively few cases, such as some areas of central and East Africa. five countries account for more than 70% of all the reported cases on the continent. How many people are dying in East Africa? The reported death rate per capita has been low compared to other parts of the world, despite the poor health infrastructure in many African countries.

Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date. Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data The WHO says this could be partly because of the relatively young population in East Africa - more than 60% under the age of 25. Covid-19 is known to have a higher mortality rate for older age groups. Another way to look at death rates is to see what proportion of people who get Covid-19 go on to die. On this basis, there are ten countries with death rates that are comparable to or higher than the most recent global average rate of under 4. 4%. But Githinji Gitahi, the head of Amref Health Africa, an NGO which specialises in health matters, says the higher rates could be an indication of much higher infection levels than those being recorded, and that it could be down to low levels of testing. The fewer tests you carry out, the fewer cases you find, and so the number of deaths appears relatively high. Different methods of reporting deaths may also affect the number of deaths. For example, where community health workers and other frontline staff record Covid-19 deaths, such as in Chad and Liberia, you could get a higher death rate.</segment>

			<data>
				<segment>How much testing is done in East Africa? There are wide variations in testing rates, with East Africa doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few, according to Our World in Data, By 12 July, East Africa had done about 36 tests per 1,000 people, compared to 106 in the UK and 122 in the US. It&apos;s worth pointing out that for some African countries, it is impossible to know what exactly is happening due to a lack of any data or data being incomplete. &quot;We have to take the numbers with a pinch of salt,&quot; says Chiedo Nwankwor, a lecturer in African affairs at Johns Hopkins University in the US. In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has voiced doubts about the validity of virus testing results at the national laboratory, and has allowed only limited data on infection rates and testing to be made public. Equatorial Guinea had a row with the WHO after accusing its country representative of inflating the number of Covid-19 cases. For a while Equatorial Guinea held back Equatorial Guinea data, but has now started sharing Equatorial Guinea again. And in Kano state in northern Nigeria, an unusual spike of close to 1,000 deaths was reported in late April, but Equatorial Guinea has not still confirmed how many were due to Covid-19. Note: The graphics in this page use a different source for figures for France from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Where are cases rising and falling? What are the symptoms of the coronavirus?</segment>

It&apos;s called, What happens when you wear a face mask, and has been marked as containing false information on Instagram. The World Health Organization is clear in its advice - face masks of a breathable material which are worn properly will not lead to health problems. The World Health Organization says: &quot;The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. &quot; The post claims No evidence masks could suppress the body&apos;s immune system, though there is no evidence to back this up. &quot;Masks may stop germs getting into your mouth or nose, so your immune system doesn&apos;t have to kick in, but this doesn&apos;t mean it is being suppressed,&quot; says Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert. Misleading news about the coronavirus seems to be everywhere. There&apos;s still a lot we don&apos;t know about the pandemic, which helps misinformation to thrive. Throw a lot of unfamiliar science or statistics into the mix and it can be difficult to know what to believe. Plenty of posts appear authoritative so it&apos;s always wise to check if something you read on social media has been reported by an organisation you can trust. tips you can follow to help spot misinformation It was shared by various accounts including one claiming to be a &quot;Natural Medicine Database&quot; with 70,000 followers and a version translated into Russian (not labelled false) by an account promoting a range of conspiracy theories. Much of the the anti-mask content comes in the form of memes making fun of them, which are widely shared on social media. One viral example compares the hazmat-style clothing worn by virologists working in a lab to protect against viruses with the face coverings that members of the public might be making at home.

				<segment> Coronavirus: Young people on benefits double in lockdown These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Andrew Adams is applying for five jobs a week in Liverpool More than one in every six young people is now claiming out-of-work benefits in some parts of the UK, BBC analysis of official figures suggests. The number of people aged 18-24 claiming Universal Credit or Jobseeker&apos;s Allowance doubled in the UK in the last three months. Parts of Liverpool and Blackpool have been worst hit, with closures of pubs, cafes and restaurants all contributing. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a £2bn scheme to help young workers. In the UK, 2. 6 million people are currently claiming Universal Credit or Jobseekers&apos; Allowance and are required to &quot;seek work&quot;. The number of young new claimants who have signed on between March and June is 276,000 - more than doubling over three months. What was in the summer statement? How did the government try to help in 2009? The Walton area of Liverpool is among the most deprived parts of the UK. About 7,500 people there are aged between 18 and 24 and the government economy is largely dominated by small retail. But the BBC analysis shows 19% of people in that age bracket are now claiming benefits - making it the worst-hit constituency in the UK. Andrew Adams, 21, has lived in the city all his life and has a degree in promotional design. Currently, his is sending out between four and five job applications a week with no success.</segment>

				<segment>&quot;At the moment I&apos;m just looking for admin work, warehouse stuff, desk work - nothing to do with my degree at all,&quot; his said. &quot;I&apos;m just getting no response. It makes me feel kind of hopeless at the moment. &quot;Once I got my degree I thought it would be smooth sailing, but it isn&apos;t at the moment. &quot; Andrew is currently taking on extra training from the Merseyside Youth Association, which helps to get the long-term unemployed back to work. the Merseyside Youth Association chief executive Gill Bainbridge said many in the city had become eligible for Universal Credit because the Merseyside Youth Association, which helps to get the long-term unemployed back to work work hours have been cut. &quot;Liverpool had a high level of unemployment to start with,&quot; she said. &quot;Liverpool economy is built around visitors and the hospitality industry. A lot of these have been impacted quite directly. The trouble we are having now is it is so competitive. &quot;If Andrew is finding it tough with those qualifications, imagine what it&apos;s like if you have low-level literacy and come from a difficult background? &quot; In London, Grace Dembowicz, a recent journalism masters graduate, finished a course at the end of June and says Liverpool has been applying for jobs throughout lockdown. The 22-year-old is one of 500,000 young people who will leave education this year and enter a labour market hit by recession and with a shrinking number of apprenticeships available. &quot;I was offered interviews, but they said it would be on commission as they don&apos;t have money for full-time pay,&quot; Liverpool said. &quot;Being realistic, I finished a recent journalism masters thinking I would get into a newsroom straight away but it&apos;s becoming more realistic that it will take a couple years to get to that stage. &quot;</segment>

				<segment>Grace Dembowicz is one of 500,000 university leavers looking for work BBC analysis has found there are now nearly 50 constituencies in the UK with more than 15% of their young population claiming out-of-work benefits. Affluent areas such as South West Surrey, Henley and Windsor have even seen a surge in the number of young claimants under lockdown, though many of these are likely to have become eligible as a result of being furloughed. According to the Resolution Foundation, one-third of employees aged 18-24 have lost jobs or been furloughed during the pandemic, compared to one-in-six adults above that age. Another think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says younger people are more likely to be employed in jobs where they cannot work from home. Prof Guy Michaels, from the London School of Economics, said the loss of the service industry since March had removed the pathway into employment for swathes of young people. &quot;It offers people work even if they don&apos;t have a huge amount of experience or completed formal skills,&quot; Prof Guy Michaels, from the London School of Economics said. &quot;This means that young people really lost this stepping stone that they take in the start of their careers. &quot; Although Prof Michaels has welcomed the government measures, he said young people might need to stay in place for years. Prof Michaels also said the success of the incentives being offered are highly dependent on job vacancies being available in the first place. &quot;After the last recession it took quite a few years for the youth unemployment to recover,&quot; Prof Michaels said. &quot;It might take three or four years to start coming down in this instance. &quot;Each recession is different but there is a worry that this isn&apos;t going to go anywhere quickly. &quot; Number of 18-24-year-olds claiming out-of-work benefits since start of Universal Credit Laura-Jane Rawlings, chief executive of Youth Employment UK, said the incentive scheme would need to stay in place for a long time to be effective. Her organisation has seen 400,000 young people apply for career help over the last three months. &quot;There can be a scarring of individuals that enter at this time. It&apos;s not just about having one or two bad years it can be persistent,&quot; Her said. &quot;The people hit the most are people from disadvantaged backgrounds. &quot; Last week, the government announced a &quot;kickstart scheme&quot; to pay for six-month work placements for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. The chancellor said a &quot;kickstart scheme&quot; to pay for six-month work placements for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit was aimed at preventing an entire generation being &quot;left behind&quot;. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: &quot;We know this is an uncertain time for many young people which is why our Plan for Jobs focuses on creating hundreds of thousands of subsidised jobs for them through a £2billion Kickstart scheme, as well as scaling up training and apprenticeships, and boosting support from Youth Employment Coaches for young jobseekers.</segment>

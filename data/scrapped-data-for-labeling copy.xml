It came in the form of a The forms, which are published each quarter by institutional investors who manage over $100 million in assets, have been a staple of investment research for more than 40 years.

E.C. notes that The change would still require disclosure for 90 percent of the dollar value of stock holdings. Very large investors, like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, whose holdings are tracked obsessively, would still be required to file 13-F’s, as would boldface names like Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group, and Dan Loeb’s Third Point. Not everyone finds the forms useful. A longstanding complaint is that 13-F disclosures are out of date, since filers have up to 45 days to disclose their holdings. (the S.

It’s unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech.

The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. The coronavirus emergency relief package gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. The coronavirus emergency relief package gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.</paragraphs>

Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,” but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and .</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19 , the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How can I protect myself while flying? If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If your seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. ) What should I do if I feel sick? If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times A record 5. 4 million people lost their health coverage amid the pandemic, a study found. the pandemic stripped an estimated 5. 4 million Americans of the pandemic health insurance between February and May, a stretch in which more adults became uninsured because of job losses than have ever lost coverage in a single year, according to a new analysis. As Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports, the to be released Tuesday by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families U. S.A. , found that the estimated increase in uninsured laid-off workers over the three-month period was nearly 40 percent higher than the highest previous increase, which occurred during the recession of 2008 and 2009. In the three-month period, 3. 9 million adults lost insurance. “We knew these numbers would be big,’’ said Stan Dorn, who directs the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families U. S.A. National Center for Coverage Innovation and was the author of a study. “This is the worst economic downturn since World War II. This dwarfs the Great Recession. So This’s not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured. ” The findings are certain to fuel the debate in Congress over the next round of virus relief. a study is a state-by-state examination of the effects of the pandemic on laid-off adults younger than 65, the age at which Americans become eligible for Medicare. a study found that nearly half — 46 percent — of the coverage losses from the pandemic came in five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and North Carolina. In Texas alone, the number of uninsured jumped from about 4. 2 million to nearly 4. 9 million, the research found, leaving three out of every 10 Texans uninsured. In the 37 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, 23 percent of laid off workers became uninsured. The percentage was nearly double that — 43 percent — in the 13 states that did not expand Medicaid , which include Texas, Florida and North Carolina.</paragraphs>

But President Trump and Republicans have pressed to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, and the administration has asked the Supreme Court to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Definitive data on loss of coverage will not be available until mid- to late-2021, when the federal government publishes health insurance estimates for 2020. “But,” Mr. Dorn said, “policymakers need to know now what the approximate magnitude is of insurance losses to decide what they need to do. So this is our best estimate for what the actual coverage losses have been. ” ‘We have a long road ahead,’ Florida’s governor warns.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The virus is surging in Florida. Here, people exploring the newly completed St. Petersburg Pier on Sunday afternoon. Zack Wittman for The New York Times Florida’s governor gave a measured assessment of his state’s battle with The virus on Monday, saying that the case numbers were still high but that there were signs of stabilization. “We have a long road ahead,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Deaths in Florida are trending upward and are at their highest seven-day average level of the pandemic. Florida added more cases on Sunday than any state had recorded — 15,300 — and on Monday it reported more than 12,600 additional cases, its second-highest total recorded for a single day. Even as The New York Times Florida’s governor appeared to be at pains not to sound too upbeat, health experts in Florida painted a much more dire picture. Carlos Migoya, the chief executive of Jackson Health Systems, which runs Jackson Memorial, one of the hardest-hit hospitals from the coronavirus, said 200 people were hospitalized three weeks ago. Now, there are more than 400 patients, 100 of 200 people in intensive care. The hospital is facing shortages in medical staff, personal protective gear and the reagents used to test for the virus. Mr. Migoya said that The hospital was now seeing older patients come in. “That means that the younger people have been contaminating the older people,” Mr. Migoya said. Despite the surge in cases, The New York Times Florida’s governor remains opposed to a statewide mask mandate. “It’s also important to listen and follow the guidance that is put out by local officials,” The New York Times Florida’s governor said. Florida has been trying to bring the positivity rate of people who are tested for the virus below 10 percent. The Florida Department of Health that as of July 11, the rate statewide was 11. 25 percent. But the mayor of Miami, Carlos A.

President Trump, in the meantime, may not get the restriction-free celebration he yearns for after all. The city of Jacksonville is requiring facial coverings in any public space where social distancing is not possible. And in a news release last week, the host committee said every attendee within the convention perimeter “will be tested and temperature checked each day. ” Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Francis Rooney of Florida have no plans to attend.

The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enroll some 825,000 students, are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. More than a third of California’s cases are in Los Angeles County and San Diego County has had over the past week, more than double the state’s acceptable threshold. The joint announcement came as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to presPresident Trump administrationCalifornia’s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students’ social and emotional development, but so that parents can return to work fully. At the White House, President Trump denounced the decision in Los Angeles, arguing that schools should resume because children wanted to attend. “Schools should be opened,” President Trump said. “You’re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed. ” It was not clear what President Trump meant, since public health experts say The virus spreads quickly in poorly ventilated, closed areas, the condition of many American schools.

				<paragraphs>A nearly empty Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Mass. Tony Luong for The New York Times A Trump administration effort to force foreign college students to take in-person classes in the fall or lose their visas has prompted a high-stakes legal battle between the White House and some of America’s top universities, with 17 states and the District of Columbia joining the fray on Monday in a lawsuit that calls the policy “senseless and cruel. ” The visa guidelines, issued a week ago, would upend months of careful planning by colleges and universities and could force many students to return to their home countries during the pandemic, where their ability to study would be severely compromised. The confrontation comes as the White House is pushing colleges and K-12 schools to throw open their doors to students, even as a growing number . Many universities have chosen to allow a limited number of students on campus but to teach most classes virtually — a decision that President Trump has derided as “ridiculous. ” Late last week, as President Trump annoyance with universities grew, President Trump threatened their nonprofit status Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both of which plan mostly online classes, were the first to challenge the new visa rules in court, saying they were hastily implemented in violation of federal procedures. universities lawsuit last week set up a high-stakes hearing scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, a day before the government is requiring schools to certify that students are taking in-person classes to meet the visa requirements. Dozens of universities have weighed in with Harvard and M. I.T. , and California’s attorney general and several universities filed their own suits in federal court late last week seeking to block the directive. “President Trump is using foreign students as pawns to keep all schools open, no matter the cost to the health and well-being of these students and their communities,” said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with Public Counsel, a legal aid organization in Los Angeles representing foreign graduate students at three California universities.</paragraphs>
				<label>not covid</label>
				<paragraphs>“It’s temper-tantrum policymaking. ” The administration responded in court filings Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has the discretion to set student visa guidance, and that just because universities don’t like the requirements doesn’t make them against the law. Latest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak A record 5. 4 million people lost their health coverage amid the pandemic, a study found. ‘We have a long road ahead,’ Florida’s governor warns. Amid surging cases, California imposes a sweeping rollback of California reopening plans. California also pointed out that the directive allows foreign students to take more online classes than they could have a year ago, when only one virtual course was allowed. The agency had waived that requirement in March, as the pandemic swept across the country and forced college campuses to abruptly close. Universities have argued that the state of emergency declared by the president in March remains in effect, so the waived visa rules should, too. “The Trump administration didn’t even attempt to explain the basis for this senseless rule, which forces schools to choose between keeping their international students enrolled and protecting the health and safety of their campuses,” Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement announcing the suit she filed Monday with 16 other states, which accuses the administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act. At stake is the fate of possibly tens of thousands of students from all over the world who are enrolled in American universities this fall, where they represent both a major source of academic brainpower and a vital revenue stream for institutions that face deep financial losses in the pandemic.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The federal guidance issued July 6 has sent students scrambling to enroll in in-person classes that are difficult to find, if they are available at all. Harvard Medical School’s plan to move instruction online would force students like Ayantu Temesgen of Ethiopia to return home. But the Ethiopian government last month shut down Ethiopia’s internet amid deadly civil unrest, and even if it returns, the time difference would be difficult to overcome. “If I’m back home, I won’t be able to wake up at 3 a. m. or 2 a. m. to attend my classes,” Ayantu Temesgen of Ethiopia said.</paragraphs>
				<label>not covid</label>
				<paragraphs>In their lawsuits, universities and the state attorneys general suggest that the new guidance is part of a politically motivated attempt to force universities to reopen, against their better judgment of the health risks. “The same day as the announcement of the administration’s reversal, the president of the United States made repeated public statements expressing the view that schools must reopen in the fall,” the lawsuit filed Monday by the states says, citing a tweet by the president saying, in all capital letters, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL! ! !” the Ethiopian government said in the Ethiopian government response that the Ethiopian government had an interest in keeping close tabs on foreign students, and allowing them to study online and untethered from a university campus posed a security risk. “A solely online program of study provides a nonimmigrant student with enormous flexibility to be present anywhere in the United States for up to an entire academic term, whether that location has been reported to the government, which raises significant national security concerns,” it said. In a harbinger of how the case may fare, the Supreme Court ruled in June that the Trump administration may not immediately proceed with its plan to end a program protecting about 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the Supreme Court did not decide whether rescinding a program protecting about 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation was sound policy, only whether “the Supreme Court complied with the procedural requirement that the Supreme Court provide a reasoned explanation for the Supreme Court action. ” The dispute illustrates the seismic shifts in how education is being delivered during the pandemic, and the consequences of that change.</paragraphs>
				<label>not covid</label>
				<paragraphs>Online education has achieved new primacy even at prestigious institutions like Harvard that previously relegated it mainly to lower-status programs like extension courses. But the move to online learning has prompted immigration authorities to ask why, if classes can be attended from anywhere in the world, students need to be in the United States to earn their degrees. “You don’t get a visa for taking online classes from, let’s say, University of Phoenix.</paragraphs>
				<label>not covid</label>
				<paragraphs>So why would you if you were just taking online classes, generally?</paragraphs>
				<label>not covid</label>
				<paragraphs>” the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, told reporters at a news conference last week. International students say this is a narrow view of what studying abroad is all about, and that being in the United States may lead to research and job opportunities that ultimately enrich the country and the United States economic, cultural and intellectual life. Meeting the demands of the government’s new guidance would be extremely difficult, universities say. Just weeks before school is scheduled to begin, universities would have to rejigger classes to make sure that hundreds of thousands of international students would have an in-person option. “The alternative is to lose significant numbers of students from their campuses,” the suit filed by state attorneys general says. The area represented by the plaintiffs contains 1,124 colleges and universities, with some approximately 373,000 international students enrolled in 2019, who contributed an estimated $14 billion to the economy that year, according to the complaint. About 40 higher education institutions filed declarations in support of the lawsuit, including Yale, DePaul, the University of Chicago, Tufts, Rutgers and state universities in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin.</paragraphs>

The California decisions are the latest blow to ’s push to fully reopen schools across the country this fall in order to get the economy moving by enabling parents to return to workplaces. Districts, parents and teachers have struggled to maintain the education of tens of millions of K-12 students while keeping them and their teachers healthy and safe. At the White House, Mr. Trump denounced the decision in Los Angeles, arguing that schools should resume because children wanted to attend. “Schools should be opened,” Mr. Trump said. “You’re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed. ” It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant, since public health experts say the virus spreads quickly in poorly ventilated, closed areas, the condition of many American schools. Across the country, school districts are taking a patchwork approach to reopening. , the nation’s largest school district, announced last week that it would provide several days per week of in-person learning, with students working online from home the rest of the time. has also announced a hybrid model that is emerging as popular nationwide , among both large and small districts. Chicago, the nation’s third-biggest system, has its reopening plan. But in cities where the virus has continued to rage, efforts at compromise solutions have increasingly proven unworkable — a shattering realization for families that have strained for months to cobble normalcy out of a situation that is pitting their children’s development and education against parental livelihoods and household health. Ms. Taylor, said the loss of in-person instruction was particularly destructive for elementary school students — many of whom cannot type — and for low-income students, who often lack internet access, and who make up nearly 60 percent of San Diego Unified’s students.

The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control. ” Mr. Beutner, whose district is the nation’s second largest, said in an interview that schools “can’t just tap our heels together” like Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz” and “pretend it’s appropriate to bring people back” despite “skyrocketing” rates of new infections. California’s death toll from the coronavirus rose to more than 7,000 over the weekend, with 7. 4 percent of test results over the past two weeks, even as testing has ramped up to more than 100,000 tests a day.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The state’s watch list of counties where the virus has surged , which has flagged Los Angeles and San Diego Counties, includes 30 of its 58 counties. For the time being, Mr. Beutner said, the Los Angeles district will maintain the online instruction it has been providing since its 700,000 students and 75,000 employees were sent home in mid-March. Mr. Beutner said the decision would be revisited when local infection rates have been sufficiently lowered and public health authorities have put into place adequate testing and contact tracing systems. “It’s disappointing,” Mr. Beutner said.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>“But at the end of the day, we’ve got to make sure everyone’s safe. ” Families in cars are directed as they line up to receive computers for San Diego Unified School District distance learning, in April in San Diego. Many parents, students and teachers are still waiting to learn whether their districts will open this fall. On Monday night, the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education is expected to adopt a plan for full-time remote learning for at least the first nine weeks of the school year. Nashville originally planned to open five days a week, but on July 9, citing the rising number of local coronavirus cases. Miami-Dade County Public Schools is currently asking parents to choose between full-time remote learning and a “schoolhouse model,” which would be in-person two to five days a week and online the rest of the time, depending on the number of students enrolled in a building and the amount of space available for social distancing. Schools in New York will only reopen if the state can keep the virus under control, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would allow reopenings only in regions of the state that have daily infection rates under 5 percent over a two-week average. Regions with infection rates over 9 percent over a one-week average will not be allowed to open schools or will automatically have their schools shuttered. New York City, which has maintained an average infection rate of 1 to 2 percent, is on track to partially reopen in September. All the plans, district leaders say, are subject to change at a moment’s notice, as public health guidance shifts or as governors make statewide decisions. Indeed, with the pandemic still raging across much of the country, it has become clear that improving the quality of online learning will be at least as important in the coming months as dealing with the logistics of reopening physical schools.</paragraphs>
				<label>covid</label>
				<paragraphs>Several other large California districts, including , have already announced that they will stick, at least for the foreseeable future, with full-time remote instruction, and the state’s politically powerful teachers’ unions also have come out against a return to in-person classes. The Los Angeles teachers’ union called last week for campuses to remain closed and for learning to be fully remote when the district resumes classes on Aug. 18, saying the state’s politically powerful teachers reopening push was part of a “dangerous, anti-science agenda. ” In an of 18,000 United Teachers Los Angeles members that was released on Friday, 83 percent agreed that campuses should not physically reopen. And the state’s largest teachers’ union wrote Mr. Newsom — a Democrat elected with their support — a last week expressing concern “that politics are being played with the lives of children and the educators who serve them. ” “It is clear that communities and school districts have not come close to meeting the threshold for a safe return to in-person learning, even under a hybrid model,” the 310,000-member California Teachers Association wrote. Some $13. 5 billion went to K-12 education from the federal relief package passed in March by Congress. But education groups and school districts estimate that schools will need much more money to safely reopen , and with the economic impact of the pandemic having depleted many local and state budgets, it is unclear where it will come from. The Trump administration has alternately threatened to cut funds to school districts that fail to fully reopen and reward districts that do. As recently as late last week, leaders in San Diego Unified were promoting their plan to reopen five days a week, in person, for all students whose families chose that option. But the Los Angeles district had also warned that the health, sanitation and educational costs of reopening physical classrooms safely were — a minimum of $90 million for the coming school year — that they would not be able to do so without a significant infusion of federal dollars. At the same time, the district’s teachers’ union was arguing that reopening during an alarming increase in coronavirus cases was unwise, and would The superintendent, Cindy Marten, had been working with education leaders across the country to lobby the Senate to pass a second stimulus package for schools. Ms. Marten said the Los Angeles district had not given up on the possibility of reopening physically if infection rates get down to a safe and manageable level, and even moved forward over the weekend with plans to buy $11 million worth of masks and other protective equipment. But the state’s current infection levels, Ms. Marten said, “should make it clear to everyone that the virus is not under control. ” “School districts need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,” Ms. Marten said. “We must both plan for a physical reopening while taking measures to keep our communities safe.</paragraphs>

Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. From June 15 to June 29, the most recent period for which data is available, businesses were closing permanently at a higher rate than in the previous three months, Yelp found.

Researchers at Harvard estimated that nearly 110,000 small businesses across the country had decided to shut down permanently between early March and early May, based on data collected in weekly surveys by Alignable, a social media network for small-business owners. Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers, said it was difficult to accurately gauge how many small businesses were closing because, once they shut their doors for good, the owners were hard to reach. Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers added that it could take up to a year before government officials knew the true toll the pandemic was taking on small businesses. 39 states continue to record growing numbers of new cases daily It is not clear how many of the businesses Yelp is tracking count as “small” — defined by the Small Business Administration as those with 500 or fewer employees.

Justin Norman said Yelp was concerned about the effects of small-business closures, especially those owned by people of color, on society. Yelp, however, also has a financial interest in maintaining a robust small-business environment, because Yelp relies heavily on advertising by businesses on Yelp platform. “The time is right now to inject more capital or we may lose them forever,” Justin Norman said. “It’s going to make our economies worse, it’s going to make our communities worse. ” More owners are permanently shutting their doors after new lockdown orders, realizing that there may be no end in sight to the crisis.

				<paragraphs>’” It was harrowing enough for small businesses — the bars, dental care practices, small law firms, day care centers and other storefronts that dot the streets and corners of every American town and city — to have to shut down after state officials imposed lockdowns in March to contain the pandemic. , especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent. Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. From June 15 to June 29, the most recent period for which data is available, businesses were closing permanently at a higher rate than in the previous three months, Yelp found. During the same period, permanent closures increased by 3 percent overall, accounting for roughly 14 percent of total closures since March. KFC closes its dining rooms in Florida amid a surge in virus cases. A White House chart of virus deaths now looks much worse. Researchers at Harvard believe the rates of business closures are . Researchers at Harvard estimated that nearly 110,000 small businesses across the country’s had decided to shut down permanently between early March and early May, based on data collected in weekly surveys by Alignable, a social media network for small-business owners. Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers, said it was difficult to accurately gauge how many small businesses were closing because, once they shut their doors for good, the owners were hard to reach. Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers added that it could take up to a year before government officials knew the true toll the pandemic was taking on small businesses. 39 states continue to record growing numbers of new cases daily It is not clear how many of the businesses Yelp is tracking count as “small” — defined by the Small Business Administration as those with 500 or fewer employees. But Yelp found that, among the tracked businesses — which include restaurants, retailers and other independent, consumer-facing operations — retail businesses, led by beauty supply stores, have been closing at the highest rate since the pandemic began. Restaurants are the next hardest-hit group. Mr. Muscari decided to permanently close Nick’s Sports Grill and Lounge in Lubbock after Texas second round of virus closures. Dylan Cole for The New York Times for The New York Times Small businesses account for 44 percent of all U. S. economic activity, according to the S.

				<paragraphs>“That leads to a big drag on the eventual recovery,” Mr. Khanna said. “Because they are such an important source of jobs, losing them the way we are losing them now is going to make things far worse than they otherwise need to be. ” Because small businesses depend heavily on foot traffic and operate on thin margins, they are especially vulnerable to the ripple effects of a widespread shutdown.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Fauci Back at the White House, a Day After Trump Aides Tried to Undermine Him Fauci Back at the White House, a Day After Trump Aides Tried to Undermine Him The visit underscored a reality for both the president and Trump Aides most prominent coronavirus adviser: They are stuck with each other. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, has served under presidents from both parties. WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump’s press office tried to undermine the reputation of the nation’s top infectious disease expert with an of what it said were his misjudgments in the early days of the coronavirus, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci returned to the White House on Monday. The visit underscored a reality for both men: They are stuck with each other. Dr. Fauci — who has not had direct contact with the president in more than five weeks even as the number of Americans with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has risen sharply in the Southwest — slipped back into the West Wing to meet with Mark Meadows, the the White House chief of staff, while his allies denounced what they called a meanspirited and misguided effort by the White House to smear him. the White House officials declined to comment on what was discussed in the conversation between Mr. Meadows, who has long expressed skepticism about the conclusions of the nation’s public health experts, and Dr. Fauci, though one official called it a good conversation and said they continued to have a positive relationship. For his part, Mr. Trump made no effort to sugarcoat his rift with Dr. Fauci, declining to repudiate the criticism of him from his staff and saying that “I don’t always agree with Mr. Trump.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” But Mr. Trump also implicitly acknowledged how unlikely Mr. Trump was to get rid of Dr. Fauci, calling Mr. Trump “a very nice person” and saying that “I like Mr. Trump personally.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” Mr. Trump could formally remove Dr. Fauci from the official coronavirus task force, but that would be a relatively meaningless step because it no longer serves as the nerve-center of a pandemic response that the Mr. Trump administration has pushed governors to take responsibility for. As the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Fauci is a career civil servant.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Firing Dr. Fauci would require a finding of cause of malfeasance, and would most likely end up tied up in lengthy appeals, though Mr. Trump could still seek to sideline Dr. Fauci in meaningless work, transfer Mr. Trump to another location or cut Mr. Trump budget in an attempt to get Mr. Trump to resign.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The anonymous accusations against Dr. Fauci were “enormously sad and totally inappropriate,” said Dr. Margaret Hamburg, a former special assistant to Dr. Fauci who served as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under President Barack Obama. “Never have we needed Mr. Trump expertise and focus more than right now.

Even some of Dr. Fauci’s senior colleagues at the Department of Health and Human Services have begun to echo the White House. Admiral Giroir, said Sunday on Dr. Fauci’s “Meet the Press” that Dr. Fauci “is not 100 percent right, and he also doesn’t necessarily — and Dr. Fauci “ admits that — have the whole national interest in mind. ” Admiral Giroir added that Dr. Fauci “looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view. ” Dr. Fauci spent the early days of the pandemic as the leading scientific voice in the federal government’s response before falling out of favor with Mr. Trump and Dr. Fauci “ top aides over blunt comments inconsistent with President Barack Obama. In task force meetings, Dr. Fauci has often styled Dr. Fauci as a solitary pessimist in a room where some officials have been eager to wave away the alarming trajectory of the coronavirus. Dr. Fauci analysis has sometimes clashed with another prominent public health figure on the task force, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who has harnessed a flurry of projections and models to package a more hopeful picture of the outbreak.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In the early days of the outbreak, Dr. Fauci, who typically sleeps only about five hours a night, lived mostly anonymously, taking the Washington Metro to the White House and Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers. Dr. Fauci still spends late nights in Dr. Fauci home office fielding calls from Dr. Fauci boss, Dr. Francis Collins, the N. I.H. director, and from politicians like Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York and a close friend. Dr. Fauci, 79, has for decades had broad access to the White House, where Dr. Fauci once explained the AIDS epidemic to President Ronald Reagan. “There’s nothing unique or special about being the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that sets you up to be an adviser to presidents,” Dr. Hamburg said. “Dr. Hamburg has become that because of what Dr. Hamburg brings to the role. ” Standing next to Mr. Trump through a long string of task force briefings in March and April, he issued warnings about the ferocity of the virus’s spread and pleas to take it seriously.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> The Washington N. F.L. team has long been a target of protests but now that its owner has budged, activists are pushing for other teams to follow suit. Earlier this month, Native American activists sent a letter to N. F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell that made a number of demands. “We are not going to give up ensuring that our humanity and dignity be respected,” said Carla Fredericks, the director of First Peoples Worldwide. Activists have spent decades pressuring professional sports leagues, college programs and high schools to abandon Native American names and imagery for their teams. The first domino fell in 1970, when the University of Oklahoma retired its mascot, a Native American named “Little Red. ” Over the ensuing years, Division I schools like Stanford, Dartmouth and Syracuse — and thousands of high schools — dropped their mascots or changed their names. But the biggest lightning rod was always Washington’s N. F.L. team, the “Redskins. ” ’s N. F.L. owner has been recalcitrant about changing the name of one of football’s oldest and most valuable franchises, and its name does not just appropriate Native American imagery, as do the N. F.L. ’s Kansas City Chiefs or N. H.L. ’s Chicago Blackhawks, but is considered by many to be a slur itself.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>On Monday, those at the forefront of the fight finally won. The Washington team announced that it would soon , for a yet-to-be revealed new name, becoming the oldest N. F.L. team name to ever be retired. “This is part of a much larger movement going on that Indigenous peoples are situated in, and it is a long time coming,” said Carla Fredericks, the director of First Peoples Worldwide and a longtime advocate against Native American mascots. “I think that for anyone that is associated with the movement for racial justice this is a significant gain, and this is a significant moment. ” That movement for racial justice is, in part, propelled by the Black Lives Matter movement, and the widespread re-examination of systemic racism — that celebrate racist history — that was prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. On Monday the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights advocacy group, said in a statement that it “welcomed the decision of the Washington, D. C., football team to drop the racist ‘Redskins’ name. ” But despite the collective power of formerly disparate movements, not to mention the half-century of activist pressure, what finally triggered the name change was not an acknowledgment of Native people’s concerns or a rumination on the name’s offense. Instead, Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington N. F.L. team for more than 20 years, was seemingly driven by a simpler motivation: money. In a letter sent to the Washington N. F.L. team dated July 2, FedEx, which pays about $8 million a year for the naming rights to the Washington N. F.L. team’s stadium in Landover, Md. , said if the name wasn’t changed, it would back out of the deal. The threat carried extra weight, considering that Frederick Smith, the chairman of FedEx, owns a minority stake in the team, which he had been quietly attempting to sell for many months. FedEx was among several corporate heavyweights to take action to convince Snyder to act on the name. Bank of America, Pepsi, Nike and other N. F.L.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>sponsors issued statements asking the Washington N. F.L. team for a name change, and retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Target stopped selling the Washington N. F.L. team’s merchandise on their websites and in their stores. Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999, said: “Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 saw, if Fred turned on it and didn’t want to stay involved in the stadium and the name, that was a really big point to Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999, and others would follow. And others did. ” Suzan Shown Harjo, who was formerly the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians and is the against Native American team names, was cleareyed about the order of concerns for Snyder. “Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 had to satisfy first, Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 FedEx and other managerial and promotion partners,” she said. “Second Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 merch partners. Third, the franchise’s 40 percent owners.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” But ultimately the credit belongs to “the longevity and persistence of our no-mascot movement,” Harjo said. Now that their biggest target has budged, activists have pushed for much work to ensue in Washington. Earlier this month, a letter, signed by nearly every national American Indian group and representatives from over 150 federally recognized tribes, was sent to N. F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. a letter, signed by nearly every national American Indian group and representatives from over 150 federally recognized tribes made several demands, including that N. F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell “require the Washington team to immediately cease the use of racialized Native American branding,” which seems on the verge of happening. But it isn’t yet clear if one of a letter, signed by nearly every national American Indian group and representatives from over 150 federally recognized tribes’s asks, that the Washington team burgundy and gold color scheme be changed, will be acceded to. “One thing we have seen where there have been shifts like this in the past is there can be a faction of fans that refuse to retreat from stereotypical names and logos, and not changing the colors would allow for that behavior,” Fredericks said. Changing the name and logo doesn’t mean as much if tens of thousands of fans stream into FedEx Field wearing their old team gear. Fans have long worn headdresses, war paint and other stereotypical imagery to Washington games, and sung along to the Washington team fight song, “Hail to the Redskins,” which contains references to “braves on the warpath” and is played after touchdowns at home games.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>the Washington team may get to delay making those decisions if fans are not allowed to attend games this season because of the coronavirus. Fredericks referred to the campaign to change the name of the University of North Dakota athletic teams, the Fighting Sioux. In 2015, the nickname was changed to the Fighting Hawks, but . “There is still an opportunity for some further leadership here by the Washington team. ” Fifty years is a long time to be fighting for one issue, to get so far but also to have so far to go. The Chiefs, Blackhawks, and Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves still exist, and more than 2,200 high schools still use . Those that have been in this fight made it clear that it was always about the future, never the present or past. “A lot of the work that she did was the attempt to create an environment that was better than the one I grew up in,” said Duke Ray Harjo II, who grew up in the Washington area, about his mother Suzan. For Fredericks, the goal goes beyond the next generation. “A lot of us have a philosophy that the work we do is not only for the current moment, but for seven generations in the future. A lot of decision making is taken with that value in place. “us are not going to give up ensuring that us humanity and dignity be respected. ” The Washington N.

On Monday, those at the forefront of this fight finally won. the Washington team announced that it would soon , for a yet-to-be revealed new name, becoming the oldest N. F.L. team name to ever be retired. “This is part of a much larger movement going on that Indigenous peoples are situated in, and it is a long time coming,” said Carla Fredericks, the director of First Peoples Worldwide and a longtime advocate against Native American mascots. “I think that for anyone that is associated with the movement for racial justice this is a significant gain, and this is a significant moment. ” That movement for racial justice is, in part, propelled by the Black Lives Matter movement, and the widespread re-examination of systemic racism — that celebrate racist history — that was prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. On Monday the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights advocacy group, said in a statement that it “welcomed the decision of the Washington, D. C., football team to drop the racist ‘RedskiRedskins’ name. ” But despite the collective power of formerly disparate movements, not to mention the half-century of activist pressure, what finally triggered the name change was not an acknowledgment of Native people’s concerns or a rumination on the name’s offense. Instead, Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington N. F.L. team for more than 20 years, was seemingly driven by a simpler motivation: money. In a letter sent to the Washington team dated July 2, FedEx, which pays about $8 million a year for the naming rights to the Washington team’s stadium in Landover, Md. , said if the name wasn’t changed, it would back out of the deal. The threat carried extra weight, considering that Frederick Smith, the chairman of FedEx, owns a minority stake in the team, which he had been quietly attempting to sell for many months. FedEx was among several corporate heavyweights to take action to convince Snyder to act on the name. Bank of America, Pepsi, Nike and other N. F.L.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>sponsors issued statements asking the Washington team for a name change, and retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Target stopped selling the Washington team’s merchandise on their websites and in their stores. Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999, said: “Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 saw, if Fred turned on it and didn’t want to stay involved in the stadium and the name, that was a really big point to Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999, and others would follow. And others did. ” Suzan Shown Harjo, who was formerly the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians and is the against Native American team names, was cleareyed about the order of concerns for Snyder. “Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 had to satisfy first, Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 FedEx and other managerial and promotion partners,” she said. “Second Donald Dell, who represented Snyder in brokering the $205 million, 27-year stadium naming rights deal in 1999 merch partners. Third, the franchise’s 40 percent owners.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>” But ultimately the credit belongs to “the longevity and persistence of our no-mascot movement,” Harjo said. Now that their biggest target has budged, activists have pushed for much work to ensue in Washington. Earlier this month, a letter, signed by nearly every national American Indian group and representatives from over 150 federally recognized tribes, was sent to N. F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell. a letter, signed by nearly every national American Indian group and representatives from over 150 federally recognized tribes made several demands, including that N. F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell “require the Washington team to immediately cease the use of racialized Native American branding,” which seems on the verge of happening. But it isn’t yet clear if one of a letter, signed by nearly every national American Indian group and representatives from over 150 federally recognized tribes’s asks, that the Washithe team’s burgundy and gold color scheme be changed, will be acceded to. “One thing we have seen where there have been shifts like this in the past is there can be a faction of fans that refuse to retreat from stereotypical names and logos, and not changing the colors would allow for that behavior,” Fredericks said. Changing the name and logo doesn’t mean as much if tens of thousands of fans stream into FedEx Field wearing their old team gear. Fans have long worn headdresses, war paint and other stereotypical imagery to Washington games, and sung along to the Washithe team’s fight song, “Hail to the Redskins,” which contains references to “braves on the warpath” and is played after touchdowns at home games. the Washington team may get to delay making those decisions if fans are not allowed to attend games this season because of the coronavirus.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Fredericks referred to the campaign to change the name of the University of North Dakota athletic teams, the Fighting Sioux. In 2015, the nickname was changed to the Fighting Hawks, but . “There is still an opportunity for some further leadership here by the Washington team. ” Fifty years is a long time to be fighting for one issue, to get so far but also to have so far to go. The Chiefs, Blackhawks, and Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves still exist, and more than 2,200 high schools still use . Those that have been in this fight made it clear that it was always about the future, never the present or past. “A lot of the work that she did was the attempt to create an environment that was better than the one I grew up in,” said Duke Ray Harjo II, who grew up in the Washington area, about his mother Suzan. For Fredericks, the goal goes beyond the next generation. “A lot of us have a philosophy that the work we do is not only for the current moment, but for seven generations in the future. A lot of decision making is taken with that value in place. “us are not going to give up ensuring that us humanity and dignity be respected.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> The debate over whether to allow the street art has exacerbated racial tensions in Catskill, where just over a fifth of the population is Black. Many storefronts along Main Street in Catskill, N. Y., have signs supporting Black Lives Matter. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times CATSKILL, N. Y. — The street painting would stretch about three blocks, from Village Pizza II to the stoplight at the southern end of Main Street, spelling out “Black Lives Matter” on the pavement. The proposal didn’t seem like too much of an ask; in the weeks since George Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis, the phrase has been painted on streets from Washington, D. C., to Charlotte, N. C., and, on Thursday, even in front of Trump Tower in Manhattan. But village leaders in The New York Times CATSKILL balked, offering several counterproposals instead, including one that would have allowed The street painting, but in the Black area of town. “I knew it was going to be a no,” said Shirley Cross, 31, a member of the Hudson/Catskill Housing Coalition, which proposed The street painting. “I just feel like it’s a slap in the face for Black people. ” Shirley Cross, a member of the Hudson/Catskill Housing Coalition, outside her home in a public housing complex, where nearly 70 percent of residents are Black. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times In cities across the nation, the civil unrest that followed Mr. Floyd’s death has heightened racial tensions and, in some cases, led to confrontations pitting protesters against the police and some community members. the civil unrest that followed Mr. Floyd’s death has also caused flash points in many smaller communities. On Saturday, a Black Lives Matter march in Kinderhook, N. Y., about 20 miles northeast of Catskill, was interrupted by a white couple who brandished a gun at protesters outside their home. a white couple who brandished a gun at protesters outside their home were eventually taken into police custody, but no arrests had been made as of Monday. “Can you imagine if I pulled a gun on people protesting in front of my house? ” Kamal Johnson, the mayor of the nearby city of Hudson, said in a Facebook video; Mr. Johnson was among those protesting on Saturday. “I’d be arrested and all over the newspapers. ” In Saranac Lake, N. Y., about 45 miles south of the Canadian border, the director of a state-sponsored said she is moving because of racist graffiti that she believed was directed at her. The graffiti, which included profanity, said “go back to Africa” and was scrawled on a railroad bridge along a As more examples of “Black Lives Matter” art have spread on streets and sidewalks, controversy has followed. In Chicago, one wording around a freshly laid painting after officials moved roadblocks, allowing it to be driven over. And in Catskill, on the western banks of the Hudson River, the debate over whether to allow a Black Lives Matter painting directly on Main Street has only exacerbated racial tensions in a village where Many Black residents live in crumbling public housing, in de facto segregation from the pockets of rural retirees and transplanted Brooklynites, an experience so starkly different they say they might as well be living in two different towns.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And it has left some Black residents wondering: To Catskill, do they matter? Village trustees rejected a Black Lives Matter painting along this section of Main Street. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town, says she no longer feels there’s a place for her in the village she has lived in since she was 12. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town is now looking to move. “I kind of gave up,” Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town said. “Even with my voice, I gave up. ” Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town spoke from a stoop where Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town lives in the Hop-O-Nose Homes, the public housing complex beside Catskill Creek, which runs southeast from the Catskill Mountains, emptying into the Hudson in the village. Nearly 70 percent of residents in public housing are people of color, according to the Catskill Housing Authority; the housing complex is close to where the alternate location of the painting was proposed to go along Water Street. The worn, low-slung red brick homes are just steps away but a world apart from the rapidly gentrifying main drag. There, a turmeric latte costs nearly $5, and “Black Trans Lives Matter” signs rest in the windows of shops, some grasped in the arms of luxury bathrobes. the Catskill Housing Authority has had a sizable Black population since at least the early 1800s, when the village was a prominent Hudson River port; by the latter part of the century, local historians said, the village drew Black families from the South. Nearly a century later, the Catskill Housing Authority continued to attract Black residents, drawn in part by the construction of new public housing like Hop-O-Nose; in more recent years, a new wave of visitors from places like Brooklyn, lured by the scenery and cheap housing stock, has given the village a more trendy vibe. “When you leave out of Hop-O-Nose, once you go out on Main Street, you see the Black Lives Matter signs here and there,” Ms. Cross said. “But there’s nothing Black On June 4, that seemed to briefly change when hundreds of villagers marched down Main Street in a rally to denounce racism. Black residents took the microphone and shared racist incidents they had endured. It was one of a flurry of such marches that sprang up here in Greene County, where President Trump, who in recent days has called Black Lives Matter “a symbol of hate,” won 60 percent of the vote in 2016. The proposal to paint Black Lives Matter on Main Street materialized around the time of the march, attracting more than 3,500 supporters on a . But the village’s five-member board of trustees — all of whom are white — rejected The proposal to paint Black Lives Matter on Main Street on June 30. the village’s five-member board of trustees initially offered the Water Street location instead; when the organizers rejected that, the trustees offered the placement of two large banners saying “Black Lives Matter. ” One could be strung across Main Street, stretching from the old 1920s vaudeville house-turned-cinema to the law offices of Brown, Kelleher &amp; Zwickel, the other alongside the high-traffic New York State Route 9W.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Cindy Schultz for Mr. Seeley, said two large banners saying “Black Lives Matter would get more visibility and last longer than paint underfoot. He said the village’s five-member board of trustees was attuned to the village’s five-member board of trustees Black residents’ needs, pointing to strides the village’s five-member board of trustees had made on behalf of the public housing residents in recent years, including revamping the lease agreements, bringing in a new director and creating a position of a village board liaison for the housing complex. “The fact that they are not willing to work with He and hear me out is really upsetting to He,” Mr. Seeley said, “and does not feel like I am getting the credit for what we have done. ” Since the proposal, the village’s five-member board of trustees has fielded requests to hold a “Blue Lives Matter” rally on Main Street, and to post an “Unborn Child Lives Matter” and an “All Lives Matter” banner, according to Mr. Seeley, who added that the board might need to reconsider whether to allow any public messaging on the board streets. Mr. Seeley said Mr. Seeley counterproposal offering the Black Lives Matter banners was an effort to blend the wishes of the different constituencies that make up Catskill: the younger residents and transplants of all races who want the painting, and an older, predominantly white population that doesn’t. “It is my job to bridge that gap between the two. And we’ve been doing a good job of that,” he said as he stood on Main Street wearing an American flag face mask and holding an iced coffee from HiLo Catskill, a cafe, cocktail lounge and gallery. “And then this ends up becoming the divisive thing. ” For now, everything is on hold. The Black Lives Matter activists have rejected the board’s offer of the Black Lives Matter banners; the village is still weighing whether to go forward. “We marched down Main Street with these folks, but when it came time for action, they unanimously said no,” said Quintin Cross, who is also a member of the Hudson/Catskill Housing Coalition. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Along Main Street, where vintage Black Panther texts are displayed at the counter of the Magpie Bookshop and anti-racism messages have popped up on chalkboards outside restaurants, few people were willing to publicly voice opposition to the Black Lives Matter painting. Dissent has seemed to take place mainly under the cover of social media, where rancorous debates run rampant in comments. “I thought all people’s lives mattered,” said a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II. The man, who was white and said a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II was against the painting, declined to give a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II name because of the sensitive nature of the subject. At the Mermaid Cafe on Main Street, Michelle Williams, the owner, stopped dishing up tacos to denounce the trustees’ decision.</paragraphs>

The graffiti, which included profanity, said “go back to Africa” and was scrawled on a railroad bridge along a As more examples of “Black Lives Matter” art have spread on streets and sidewalks, controversy has followed. In Chicago, one wording around a freshly laid painting after officials moved roadblocks, allowing it to be driven over. And in the Catskill Housing Authority, on the western banks of the Hudson River, the debate over whether to allow a Black Lives Matter painting directly on Main Street has only exacerbated racial tensions in a village where Many Black residents live in crumbling public housing, in de facto segregation from the pockets of rural retirees and transplanted Brooklynites, an experience so starkly different they say they might as well be living in two different towns.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And it has left some Black residents wondering: To the Catskill Housing Authority, do they matter? Village trustees rejected a Black Lives Matter painting along this section of Main Street. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town, says she no longer feels there’s a place for her in the village she has lived in since she was 12. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town is now looking to move. “I kind of gave up,” Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town said. “Even with my voice, I gave up. ” Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town spoke from a stoop where Cindy Schultz for The New York Times Ms. Cross, a supervisor at a shoe store in town lives in the Hop-O-Nose Homes, the public housing complex beside Catskill Creek, which runs southeast from the Catskill Mountains, emptying into the Hudson in the village’s five-member board of trustees. Nearly 70 percent of residents in public housing are people of color, according to the Catskill Housing Authority; the housing complex is close to where the alternate location of the painting was proposed to go along Water Street. The worn, low-slung red brick homes are just steps away but a world apart from the rapidly gentrifying main drag. There, a turmeric latte costs nearly $5, and “Black Trans Lives Matter” signs rest in the windows of shops, some grasped in the arms of luxury bathrobes. the Catskill Housing Authority has had a sizable Black population since at least the early 1800s, when the village’s five-member board of trustees was a prominent Hudson River port; by the latter part of the century, local historians said, the village’s five-member board of trustees drew Black families from the South. Nearly a century later, the Catskill Housing Authority continued to attract Black residents, drawn in part by the construction of new public housing like Hop-O-Nose; in more recent years, a new wave of visitors from places like Brooklyn, lured by the scenery and cheap housing stock, has given the village’s five-member board of trustees a more trendy vibe. “When you leave out of Hop-O-Nose, once you go out on Main Street, you see the Black Lives Matter signs here and there,” Ms. Cross said. “But there’s nothing Black On June 4, that seemed to briefly change when hundreds of villagers marched down Main Street in a rally to denounce racism. Black residents took the microphone and shared racist incidents they had endured. It was one of a flurry of such marches that sprang up here in Greene County, where President Trump, who in recent days has called Black Lives Matter “a symbol of hate,” won 60 percent of the vote in 2016. The proposal to paint Black Lives Matter on Main Street materialized around the time of the march, attracting more than 3,500 supporters on a . But the village’s five-member board of trustees — all of whom are white — rejected The proposal to paint Black Lives Matter on Main Street on June 30. the village’s five-member board of trustees initially offered the Water Street location instead; when the organizers rejected that, the trustees offered the placement of two large banners saying “Black Lives Matter. ” One could be strung across Main Street, stretching from the old 1920s vaudeville house-turned-cinema to the law offices of Brown, Kelleher &amp; Zwickel, the other alongside the high-traffic New York State Route 9W.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Cindy Schultz for Mr. Seeley, said the Black Lives Matter banners would get more visibility and last longer than paint underfoot. He said the village’s five-member board of trustees was attuned to the village’s five-member board of trustees Black residents’ needs, pointing to strides the village’s five-member board of trustees had made on behalf of the public housing residents in recent years, including revamping the lease agreements, bringing in a new director and creating a position of a village board liaison for the housing complex. “The fact that they are not willing to work with He and hear me out is really upsetting to He,” Mr. Seeley said, “and does not feel like I am getting the credit for what we have done. ” Since The proposal to paint Black Lives Matter on Main Street, the village’s five-member board of trustees has fielded requests to hold a “Blue Lives Matter” rally on Main Street, and to post an “Unborn Child Lives Matter” and an “All Lives Matter” banner, according to Mr. Seeley, who added that the board might need to reconsider whether to allow any public messaging on the board streets. Mr. Seeley said Mr. Seeley counterproposal offering the Black Lives Matter banners was an effort to blend the wishes of the different constituencies that make up the Catskill Housing Authority: the younger residents and transplants of all races who want the painting, and an older, predominantly white population that doesn’t. “It is my job to bridge that gap between the two. And we’ve been doing a good job of that,” he said as he stood on Main Street wearing an American flag face mask and holding an iced coffee from the Catskill Housing Authority, a cafe, cocktail lounge and gallery. “And then this ends up becoming the divisive thing. ” For now, everything is on hold. The Black Lives Matter activists have rejected the board’s offer of the Black Lives Matter banners; the village’s five-member board of trustees is still weighing whether to go forward. “We marched down Main Street with these folks, but when it came time for action, they unanimously said no,” said Quintin Cross, who is also a member of the Hudson/Catskill Housing Coalition. Cindy Schultz for The New York Times CATSKILL for The New York Times Along Main Street, where vintage Black Panther texts are displayed at the counter of the Magpie Bookshop and anti-racism messages have popped up on chalkboards outside restaurants, few people were willing to publicly voice opposition to the Black Lives Matter painting. Dissent has seemed to take place mainly under the cover of social media, where rancorous debates run rampant in comments. “I thought all people’s lives mattered,” said a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II. The man, who was white and said a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II was against the painting, declined to give a man unloading pizza boxes from a truck outside Village Pizza II name because of the sensitive nature of the subject. At the Mermaid Cafe on Main Street, Michelle Williams, the owner, stopped dishing up tacos to denounce the trustees’ decision.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Ms. Williams, who is white, said she was deeply affected by the searing stories she heard from her Black neighbors duthe Catskill Housing Authority march. “To just have a bunch of people in their folding-chair thrones telling them ‘no,’ it’s just really shortsighted,” Ms. Williams, who is white said. “You have people who are playing both sides here,” Ms. Williams, who is white added. “But what’s the side?

Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times Ms. Cheung is a writer in Hong Kong. Last year, in July, a month after the protests over an extradition bill began in Hong Kong, I renewed the lease on my flat. For the first time since I turned 18, I would be living in the same apartment for more than two years. It felt like an accomplishment, like I was a real adult. My place is almost 300 square feet, and it has a view of trees and steps, which is such an improvement from my last flat that sometimes just looking out the window makes me emotional. I ordered a cheap Ikea carpet and put up old posters. I started buying vinyl records and physical books again. I could be here for a while . It began to feel like home. There are so many reasons Hong Kong is not a particularly habitable city, so many reasons you might want to leave, even without the Chinese Communist Party threatening to throw dissidents in jail.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>I am 27 now, and when I was younger, I desperately wanted to leave Hong Kong. I grew up in a neighborhood that, at the time, felt like a cultural backwater. There were no bookstores, no art, no record shops. I attended a conservative Christian school and never really fit in. I went to concerts alone. I wrote fan fiction and spent all my time on Tumblr. I thought I wanted to go to school in London or New York, where I’d finally find “my people. ” The longest I’ve ever managed to be away from New York was four months, for an exchange semester in Scotland. I never really ended up going anywhere. But that was OK, because eventually I did find my people. I met community activists and other young creative types who showed me an alternative way of living in Hong Kong. I became a regular at the cha chaan teng diners in my neighborhood, where I’d be given a second bowl of soup at dinner once the staff found out that I didn’t live with my family. There were local musicians whose shows I’d never miss. In university, I began going to protests.</paragraphs>

At the end of December, I celebrated New Year’s Eve at a small pro-protest cafe where a friend played the unofficial protest anthem, “ After six months of street protests and police violence, we were all exhausted, but it still felt like we were on the cusp of change. I was 10 when the Hong Kong government tried to introduce a national security law in 2003, and it was quickly withdrawn after half a million people took to the streets in protest. That proposal was a sword that hung over us for nearly two decades, a threat to what Hong Kongers hold most dear — a culture of protest, the rule of law, freedom. We’ve been fighting for “freedom,” that abstract concept, for so long, with no idea of what losing it would look like. it was delivered with devastating speed — the whole process took less than two months — in the form of a 66-article piece of legislation that we had no say in.

But leaving is not an option for the young people who don’t already have British or B. N.O. passports or whose families don’t have the means to send them abroad to study. Ahkok Wong, a musician-social activist I know, actually moved back to Hong Kong recently, telling me, “I think it’s an important time to be here. ” Life in Hong Kong has always been about demanding the impossible, trying to make seeds blossom in cement, he says. After this law went into effect on July 1, I tried to write. But what I wanted was to walk around the city, and then go to the seaside where the breeze reeks of salt and summer, where couples make out and uncles jog near the pallets unloaded from cargo ships at the Western District pier. To see the city through the eyes of someone who’s just moved here and think, “I want to stay here forever. ” The pier at Hong Kong Western District pier is also known as “Instagram Pier. ” Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times I used to see leaving as abandonment, but the cost of staying could now potentially be life imprisonment.</paragraphs>

Ahkok Wong, a musician-social activist I know, actually moved back to Hong Kong recently, telling me, “I think it’s an important time to be here. ” Life in Hong Kong has always been about demanding the impossible, trying to make seeds blossom in cement, he says. After this law went into effect on July 1, I tried to write. But what I wanted was to walk around the city, and then go to the seaside where the breeze reeks of salt and summer, where couples make out and uncles jog near the pallets unloaded from cargo ships at “Instagram Pier. To see the city through the eyes of someone who’s just moved here and think, “I want to stay here forever. ” The pier at Hong Kong Western District pier is also known as “Instagram Pier. ” Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times I used to see leaving as abandonment, but the cost of staying could now potentially be life imprisonment.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>When announced that he had left the city, I thought about the last time I saw him, a month ago, at Hill Road. I wish I had stayed longer to thank he for trying to make the city more habitable. Four years ago, when elections still seemed to matter, I had voted for he, to make he the youngest legislator ever elected in Hong Kong, before he was disqualified.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>There will be new forms of resistance, here or elsewhere, and I know he will be a part of them. I remember the night before July 1, it seemed like all my friends were posting the same song on social media, a cover by the Hong Kong band My Little Airport. it goes, “Take care tonight/ Things might not look like this tomorrow. ” In between the verses, there is an archival recording of Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, saying, “Now Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong, that is the promise and that is the unshakable destiny. ” the promise has been broken, but this is not the end. We will continue to make a home out of an imperfect place. To wipe down the mold, repaint the walls. One day We could be forcibly evicted, or this could all burn to the ground. But for now, We’re still here. Maybe We can still try to make an imperfect place beautiful. ) is a writer in Hong Kong. The Times is committed to publishing to the editor.

				<paragraphs> What a Second Trump Term Would Look Like What a Second Trump Term Would Look Like a Second Trump Term won’t overthrow the Constitution. But a Second Trump Term might persuade Americans that democracy just does not work. Mr. Posner is a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School. A second term for President Trump would most likely not burst the bounds of the Constitution. Back when President Trump was running for president in 2016, Republican leaders claimed to believe that, as president, President Trump would respect the rule of law. “I still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,” Senator John McCain Romania is looking pretty good these days.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Freedom House, an organization that monitors political freedoms in countries around the world, has the United States to a score of 86 out of 100, just three points higher than Senator John McCain Romania, and far below America’s erstwhile democratic peers like Britain and Germany. (the United States received a score of 94 in 2010. ) President Trump has both benefited from, and contributed to, this alarming decline. But to give Mr. McCain his due, the president has not yet in a clear sense violated the laws or Constitution of the United States. Mr. McCain has blustered and threatened to break the law but always pulled back at the last minute in the most important cases. Mr. McCain damage to the United States has come through Mr. McCain poisoning of the public discourse with lies and insults; Mr. McCain efforts, largely unsuccessful, to direct criminal investigations against Mr. McCain enemies; Mr. McCain politically motivated manipulation of Mr. McCain office to enhance Mr. McCain standing at the expense of American foreign policy and the broader public interest; Mr. McCain appointment of hacks to high positions in government; and Mr. McCain terrible policy choices, including Mr. McCain neglect of the coronavirus pandemic. All of this was legal, alas, with the ambiguous exception of Mr. McCain (mostly unsuccessful) obstruction of criminal investigations of Mr. McCain aides. Mr. McCain former boss a “danger for the republic” if re-elected. Will Mr. Trump in a second term finally burst the bounds of the Constitution as so many critics have predicted since he entered office in 2017? The answer is most likely no, and for two reasons. First, American institutions, while damaged, remain robust. American institutions have mostly pushed back when Mr. Trump tried to push American institutions aside. The courts have frequently ruled against, and even condemned, Mr. Trump. The press has been unfazed by Mr. Trump’s harassment of journalists. the United States ignored Mr. Trump’s orders to lift their Covid-19 lockdowns or to suppress protests against police brutality. The military balked when Mr. Trump threatened to send personnel against protesters. While wobbly, the Justice Department has mostly followed through on investigations of Mr. Trump allies — with the withdrawal of the prosecution of Michael Flynn a rare exception. Second, and surprisingly for some, Mr. Trump has not tried to expand Mr. Trump powers. There is a long history in other countries of democratically elected leaders seizing dictatorial powers in an emergency, and Mr. Trump’s critics expected the same from Mr. Trump. But when an authentic crisis struck the United States in the form of the pandemic, Mr. Trump was conspicuously uninterested in seizing power or even using the powers Mr. Trump already possessed.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>By contrast, Viktor Orban, the leader of Hungary, followed the demagogue’s playbook by The brute political fact that distinguishes Mr. Trump and Mr. Orban is that Mr. Trump is exceedingly unpopular and widely distrusted — and has been since his election in 2016. Mr. Orban lacks political support for any authoritarian ambitions Mr. Orban may harbor. Americans, with a long if fraying tradition of democracy that countries like Hungary lack, still seem uninterested in a king. All this is not to argue for complacency in case the president is re-elected but to suggest that we focus on the damage that Mr. Trump is likely to do rather than worst-case scenarios that are unlikely to occur. As long as Republicans remain in power in the Senate, Mr. Trump will continue to have a free hand to appoint loyalists like Attorney General Bill Barr, who has increasingly shielded Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump allies from investigations and prosecution. Angered by adverse rulings by Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump will probably seek to appoint a lackey if a vacancy opens up. Mr. Trump has compiled an astonishing record of failure for Mr. Trump regulatory agencies — according to one , courts have blocked agency actions (including deregulatory actions craved by Mr. Trump business allies) almost 90 percent of the time. We can expect further mismanagement of U. S. agencies during a second term. Many civil servants are demoralized by the administration’s hostility to regulation; others resent political pressure from above. Many of these people, who represent a deep well of expertise on everything from nuclear power to epidemiology, may quit rather than endure four more years of contempt and harassment. Mr. Trump has used many legal resources at Mr. Trump disposal to block foreigners from working and taking refuge in the United States and to disrupt foreign trade. Expect more of the same, with further damage to America’s economy and its relationships with its allies. Expect Mr. Trump to continue to abuse the presidency’s powers over foreign affairs to the detriment of American foreign policy. Mr. Trump may finally indulge Mr. Trump impulse to withdraw the United States from NATO. Disgusted with Mr. Trump’s penchant for cozying up to dictators and offering concessions in return for support for his electoral interests, Western democracies will continue to distance themselves from the United States. Unconstrained by the prospect of electoral backlash, Mr. Trump will use Mr. Trump pardon power even more flagrantly than Mr. Trump already has to reward political allies who broke the law. At the same time, if Mr. Trump remains unpopular even after winning re-election, it seems likely that the courts, the agencies and Congress will continue to hem Mr. Trump in, preventing Mr. Trump from acting forcefully even when Mr. Trump should. A weakened presidency, whoever occupies the office, will be unable to address significant domestic problems — including the continuing risks from the pandemic and the growing unease about policing — and will embolden dangerous foes, from Russia to Iran.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>If Mr. Trump is a danger to democracy, it is not because Mr. Trump will overthrow the Constitution. It is because Mr. Trump contempt for American values and institutions, and Mr. Trump ineptitude as a leader, may persuade Americans, by Mr. Trump example if nothing else, that democracy just does not work.

				<paragraphs> South Korea’s Women Are Still Waiting for Justice South Korea’s Women Are Still Waiting for Justice Allegations against a prominent liberal mayor are the latest evidence in a series of terrible wrongs against Korean women. Kim Hye-jeong, deputy head of the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center, holding up a sign Monday declaring solidarity with the accuser of Seoul’s mayor, Park Won-soon. An elaborate public funeral was held on Monday in Seoul, South Korea, in honor of the city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, a prominent human rights lawyer and confidant of President Moon Jae-in. Mr. Park was found dead last week, by suicide, hours after a personal assistant in his office filed a claim of sexual abuse and harassment against him. This news, in its painful complexity, has shocked the Korean people, a fifth of whom live in Seoul. Mr. Park, a , was known to his constituents as a friend to the poor and homeless; a man who, as an activist and lawyer, had successfully litigated the nation’s first sexual harassment case and won accolades from feminist groups. More recently, his had earned praise for allowing to take part in the 2016 Candlelight Movement in downtown Seoul, which led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye and the eventual election of Mr. Moon. Yet Mr. Park, the second most powerful man in South Korea, was also accused of perpetrating sexual harassment and assault. As his receives honor in death, his accuser remains anonymous and her claim will go uninvestigated. Under South Korean law, the case will be closed without an indictment because the suspect is dead. And the city and central governments ignored the signatures of more than 570,000 Koreans Online, supporters of Mr. Park and his party have accused the personal assistant of lying and conspiring with the opposition party, while conservatives have used the allegations to attack the Mr. Moon administration. Trolls have circulated disinformation and tried to uncover the woman’s identity. (the woman name has not been revealed. ) At a news conference on Monday afternoon, the wom’s lawyer and representatives of two feminist groups and demanded a “full investigation. ” According to the employee, over the past five years, Mr. Park subjected Mr. Park to unwanted kisses and other touching, sent Mr. Park photographs of Mr. Park in Mr. Park underwear and repeatedly texted Mr. Park messages of a sexual nature. When Mr. Park complained to officials in the mayor’s office, Mr. Park alleges, Mr. Park received no assistance. In a prepared statement read by a representative, Mr. Park explained that the events of the past week have caused Mr. Park tremendous grief: “I don’t know how I’ll go on.

In late June, a top Korean triathlete killed herself after documenting what she said were years of abuse for a man who had completed a sentence of only 18 months in jail for operating an international child-pornography site. It’s no surprise, then, that so many women in South Korea feel unseen and unsafe.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The justice system, even under the liberal government of Moon Jae-in, has seemed to offer them little protection. To regain the trust of the Korean people, the Moon administration and the city of Seoul must apologize to Park Won-soon’s former employee and investigate every allegation of harassment and assault against him. Beyond the case at hand, South Korea must build and strengthen reliable mechanisms that secure women’s rights on the job and in the streets — through labor unions, feminist groups, independent watchdog agencies, more robust sex-crimes legislation and regulations to shield people who make harassment claims from retaliation. Such basic public safety should be a matter of human rights, not party politics. At Monday’s news conference, the woman at the center of the case at hand echoed this humble demand in her statement: “I dream of a world that simply respects all human beings. ” The Times is committed to publishing to the editor.

When Mr. Park complained to officials in the mayor’s office, Mr. Park alleges, Mr. Park received no assistance. In a prepared statement read by a representative, Mr. Park explained that the events of the past week have caused Mr. Park tremendous grief: “I don’t know how I’ll go on.

To regain the trust of the Korean people, the Moon administration and the city of Seoul must apologize to Park Won-soon’s former employee and investigate every allegation of harassment and assault against him. Beyond the case at hand, South Korea must build and strengthen reliable mechanisms that secure women’s rights on the job and in the streets — through labor unions, feminist groups, independent watchdog agencies, more robust sex-crimes legislation and regulations to shield people who make harassment claims from retaliation. Such basic public safety should be a matter of human rights, not party politics.

Mr. Akerman was an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. Mueller was sworn in to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill last July. In 1973, I served as an assistant special prosecutor for the Watergate Special Prosecution Force, which investigated the connection between the White House and the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, the subsequent cover-up and other crimes connected with the White House under Richard Nixon.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And nothing that I saw then — even during the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, when Richard Nixon ordered Richard Nixon attorney general to fire the special prosecutor — rises to what we are witnessing now with President Trump. The commutation last week of Roger Stone’s sentence is the latest of multiple, brazen efforts to make the fulfillment of the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller The efforts by President Trump have amounted to a cover-up — and they were often made possible by President Trump ability to control the Justice Department and by the lack of independence of the investigation. It demands a renewed look at how we empower independent counsels — regrettably, history has shown us that, under extraordinary circumstances, they are needed to conduct proper oversight of abuse by the executive branch. That is a big difference from my experience in the Watergate prosecution: Established by the Justice Department, us investigation was functionally independent from the investigation and the executive branch. us did not answer to the attorney general. us were not restricted from investigating or prosecuting Nixon, nor were us governed by any internal the Justice Department rule that prohibited prosecuting a sitting president. And as the efforts by the attorney general, Bill Barr, and Mr. Trump’s commuting of the Stone sentence make clear, that lack of independence has made a big difference. From the start, Mueller was restrained by the Justice Department regulations. Mueller was barred, for example, from looking into the broader relationship between Mr. Trump and Russia through a review of Mr. Trump’s financial records and tax returns. Furthermore, according to the Mueller report, Mr. Trump’s made multiple attempts to fire the special counsel, and it is difficult, if not almost impossible, to conduct an investigation under those circumstances. Ultimately, an investigation undeMueller circumstances did complete an investigation under those circumstances limited into whether any member of the Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with the Russian government (an investigation under those circumstances did not “establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities”); an investigation under those circumstances also detailed the evidence, without reaching conclusions, relating to Mr. Trump’s obstruction of justice. But as a result of those limitations, Mr. Trump, with the assistance of Mr. Barr, spun the narrative to affect the impact on the American public of the Mueller report and, as we have seen with Mr. Stone and Michael Flynn, undermined the criminal convictions obtained by Mr. Mueller’s team. In an investigation under those circumstances, the special prosecutor decided not to indict Nixon because Congress was actively considering impeachment. After convicting the major figures in the scandal, including two attorneys general, almost no one (except Nixon) was pardoned and no one had their sentences commuted. Upon completion of an investigation under those circumstances, we issued a report without anyone in the executive branch spinning its results. Mr. Mueller’s team convicted Mr. Stone for covering up for Mr. Trump. By granting clemency to Mr. Stone, the president expands the cover-up. Mr. Trump’s purpose has been clear: to prevent Mr. Stone and others (like Paul Manafort and Mr. Flynn) from recounting the full truth about the actions of the Mr. Trump campaign in 2016 concerning Russian interference. It is no coincidence that the only former Mr. Trump confidant in federal prison is the one who truthfully testified against Mr. Trump, his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. in the past year — primarily from Mr. Stone’s trial, as well as unredacted parts of the Mueller report — has offered more evidence about the areas of collusion and obstruction.</paragraphs>

The Constitution obligates Mr. Trump to “take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed. ” The Constitution does not permit a president to grant clemency or to pardon a co-conspirator, an obvious conflict of interest. Even Bill Barr has said as much. When asked at Mr. Trump confirmation hearing if a president can “lawfully issue a pardon in exchange for the recipient’s promise to not incriminate Mr. Trump,” Mr. Trump No court has ever confronted this issue, and no court is likely to be asked to confront this issue regarding Stone because there is no independent prosecutor to challenge Mr. Trump’s commutation of the Stone sentence.

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>It is separate from the newsroom. New York City police officers in Lower Manhattan on July 1. boy was fatally shot over the weekend, one of the latest victims in a surge of violence that has rattled an already traumatized city. As of Monday, New York City had had 634 shootings this year, up from 394 at the same time last year, according to its Police Department data. violence comes as New York City emerges from some of the darkest, most tumultuous months in New York City history. Tens of thousands of people are dead from New York City. Nearly one in five working-age New Yorkers is out of a job. Faced with enormous suffering during a pandemic, a possible economic collapse and maybe the , a healthy police department could have acted as a balm. Many members of the New York Police Department work hard every day to do just that, putting their lives on the line alongside the city’s nurses, Emergency Medical Services workers, mass transit employees and other essential workers. But too often in recent months, instead of a balm, the New York Police Department has become another source of trauma. the New York Police Department unleashed disproportionate on crowds of overwhelmingly peaceful protesters, beating them with batons; punching, shoving and tackling them; and driving a police vehicle through a large group. on unarmed civilians. In one case, an officer was caught on video removing the mask of a protester and pepper-spraying him in the face. In another, officers pepper-sprayed a sitting member of the State Senate at point-blank range. and held hundreds of people for over 24 hours without them seeing a judge. The Legal Aid Society has sued, arguing that the detentions violated a state law requiring arraignment within a day. Arrestees were also held in at Police Headquarters and other locations in the midst of the pandemic. Scores of officers did not wear protective masks while on duty at the protests, violating policy and risking their health and the health of others, even after the department sometimes used aggressive tactics against civilians for the same offense, giving summonses to and arresting Black and Hispanic residents at higher rates than white residents. On May 13, an unarmed Black woman in front of her young child for failing to properly wear her mask on the subway. Even as officers battled peaceful protesters in the streets, the department failed to prevent theft and the destruction of property in Midtown Manhattan, SoHo and the Bronx. Large numbers of officers at the protests at disciplinary hearings held over video chat.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>One of the city’s police unions felt insulated enough from oversight that it posted private details about the arrest of , the Black daughter of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who told her father she was arrested while peacefully protesting.

				<paragraphs>New York City police officers in Lower Manhattan on July 1. boy was fatally shot over the weekend, one of the latest victims in a surge of violence that has rattled an already traumatized city. As of Monday, New York City had had 634 shootings this year, up from 394 at the same time last year, according to the Police Department data. violence comes as New York City emerges from some of the darkest, most tumultuous months in New York City history. Tens of thousands of people are dead from the coronavirus. Nearly one in five working-age New Yorkers is out of a job. Faced with enormous suffering during a pandemic, a possible economic collapse and maybe the , a healthy police department could have acted as a balm. Many members of the New York Police Department work hard every day to do just that, putting their lives on the line alongside the city’s nurses, Emergency Medical Services workers, mass transit employees and other essential workers. But too often in recent months, instead of a balm, the New York Police Department has become another source of trauma. the New York Police Department unleashed disproportionate on crowds of overwhelmingly peaceful protesters, beating them with batons; punching, shoving and tackling them; and driving a police vehicle through a large group. on unarmed civilians. In one case, an officer was caught on video removing the mask of a protester and pepper-spraying him in the face. In another, officers pepper-sprayed a sitting member of the State Senate at point-blank range. and held hundreds of people for over 24 hours without them seeing a judge. The Legal Aid Society has sued, arguing that the detentions violated a state law requiring arraignment within a day. Arrestees were also held in at Police Headquarters and other locations in the midst of the pandemic. Scores of officers did not wear protective masks while on duty at the protests, violating policy and risking their health and the health of others, even after the Police Department sometimes used aggressive tactics against civilians for the same offense, giving summonses to and arresting Black and Hispanic residents at higher rates than white residents. On May 13, an unarmed Black woman in front of her young child for failing to properly wear her mask on the subway. Even as officers battled peaceful protesters in the streets, the Police Department failed to prevent theft and the destruction of property in Midtown Manhattan, SoHo and the Bronx. Large numbers of officers at the protests at disciplinary hearings held over video chat.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Neglecting aggression by Vladimir Putin inevitably invites more of it. President Trump with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Japan last year. for attacks against U. S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan? President Trump with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Japan last year hasn’t so far offered a direct answer but instead shifting, manipulative responses. That is itself troubling. itself is also troubling that President Trump with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Japan last year has not condemned even the possibility of such Russian aggression. But let’s step back and set aside the question of Russian bounties for a moment. For years, Russia has provided material and financial assistance to the Taliban, with what was surely the intent of supporting attacks against troops from the United States and coalition forces. Was President Vladimir Putin of Russia aware of that? I can answer that question: Yes, President Vladimir Putin of Russia was most certainly aware of Russian assistance to the Taliban. Despite that knowledge, President Vladimir Putin of Russia chose to do nothing. From 2016 to 2018, I was the C. I.A. ’s chief for counterterrorism in south and southwest Asia, overseeing operations and intelligence concerning Afghanistan, which included related activities of regional actors, like Russia. “Bounty” is not a term intelligence professionals would likely use. Intelligence reporting requires precision in language to guard against the risk of misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and “bounty” lacks specificity in meaning, purpose and consequence. Intelligence professionals speak with dry, clinical facts and assessments that are not “confirmed” or “verified,” but rather corroborated to various degrees of confidence. The goal is to provide President Vladimir Putin of Russia with information on developments that may significantly affect U. S. interests. With information on developments that may significantly affect U. S. interests, the president and President Vladimir Putin of Russia team can take any necessary action against potential threats. The government can’t wait for complete certainty; by then it would be too late to do anything about it. it can therefore be semantically true that President Vladimir Putin of Russia never received a briefing on Russian “bounties” — that specific word may not have been uttered.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But the White House does not deny news reports that the on Feb. 27 included information from our intelligence agencies in clinical terms that Russians were offering financial incentives to encourage Taliban attacks against U. S. and coalition troops. Now, Russians would not provide the Taliban blank checks. The continuation and expansion of Russians assistance would have required that Taliban provide evidence — videos proving that Taliban used Russian arms and financing to attack U. S. and coalition targets. Intelligence services use this common practice to verify the investments in proxy groups, as well as to make sure they are productive and aligned with their goals. Even the Russian military intelligence agency, widely known as the G. R.U. , has auditors who need to ensure that funds expensed are used as intended. But in short, American intelligence agencies reported that Russians were offering bounties — even if the Russians were offering bounties were called “ the Russians were offering bounties look like an escalation of that earlier Russian support for the Taliban — support that was publicly by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 and by the commander of U. S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, At a 2017 news conference, when asked whether he was refuting that Russia was sending weapons to the Taliban, General Nicholson Secretary Mattis received the President’s Daily Briefs that Mr. Trump did. Gen. John Nicholson read both strategic- and tactical-level reporting about Afghanistan, including the actions of Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan and India that might affect military and political circumstances on the ground. There is nothing inaccurate in the observations from Generals Mattis and Nicholson. The president must have known all this, too. There is also substantial evidence concerning Pakistan’s and Iran’s support for Taliban efforts to target U. S. troops.</paragraphs>

Qassim Suleimani. Iran’s Shiite leadership is not an ideological ally of the Sunni Taliban, but as Russia does, it looks for opportunities to hasten America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, increase influence with Taliban and make America pay a price for a military presence so near America borders. The Iranian and Pakistani support probably did more to endanger Americans and Afghans than Russian aid did. So the president was right to support efforts to address, within practical limits, evidence of Pakistani and Iranian behavior affecting the security of Americans. Yet Mr. Trump took no action against Moscow. Mr. Trump could have signaled discontent with Russia diplomatically, economically or through back-channel intelligence conduits. Instead, to make matters worse, Mr. Trump pressured the U. S. intelligence community to invest time and resources in potential counterterrorist cooperation. the U. S. intelligence community backfired: Russia was not forthcoming and sought to manipulate the engagement to influence policymakers and target Russian dissidents. As any observer of Russia knows, neglecting aggression inevitably invites more of Russia — to expand Russian influence and power at American expense. For examples, look at Ukraine, Syria and increasingly Libya, Africa and even Europe. In Afghanistan, the aggression apparently took the form of more audacious Russian behavior like bounties. We cannot ignore the bigger picture of America’s Afghanistan policy. Within days of receiving the Feb. 27 daily brief addressing Russian bounties, Mr. Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to oversee an agreement with the Taliban for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan — despite the Taliban’s kidnapping just weeks earlier of an American civil engineer and government contractor, Security Council shared information — reaffirmed by our own intelligence in a Pentagon dated July 1 — concerning close and continuing cooperation between the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Even the leader of the U. S. Central Command, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, told the Middle East Institute on that the Taliban had yet to meet conditions concerning the Taliban cooperation and relationship with Al Qaeda to merit the U. S. withdrawal. Clearly, regardless of the facts on the ground or the intelligence about Russia and Al Qaeda, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remain determined to see through their agreement with the Taliban and likewise make the Taliban appear a success. It is easy to get lost in the fog of Mr. Trump’s continuing and calculated war of denial and deception. But this much is plain: Mr. Trump’s has still, despite weeks of public debate over Russian bounties, not offered a clear and unambiguous condemnation of such Russian aggression. It’s imperative that Mr. Trump’s be held accountable.</paragraphs>

Within days of receiving the Feb. 27 daily brief addressing Russian bounties, Mr. Trump directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to oversee an agreement with the Taliban for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan — despite the Taliban’s kidnapping just weeks earlier of an American civil engineer and government contractor, Security Council shared information — reaffirmed by our own intelligence in a Pentagon dated July 1 — concerning close and continuing cooperation between the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Even the leader of the U. S. Central Command, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, told the Middle East Institute on that the Taliban had yet to meet conditions concerning the Taliban cooperation and relationship with Al Qaeda to merit the U. S. withdrawal. Clearly, regardless of the facts on the ground or the intelligence about Russia and Al Qaeda, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remain determined to see through Mr. Trump and Mr. Ptheir agreement with the Taliban and likewise make the Taliban appear a success. It is easy to get lost in the fog of Mr. Trump’s continuing and calculated war of denial and deception. But this much is plain: Mr. Trump’s has still, despite weeks of public debate over Russian bounties, not offered a clear and unambiguous condemnation of such Russian aggression. It’s imperative that Mr. Trump’s be held accountable.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Injured and unusable lungs were restored with respirators and pig blood. The procedure one day may increase the supply of organs for transplant. A 3-D C. T. scan of healthy human lungs. Each set has a folded surface area about the size of a tennis court.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>healthy human lungs were taken from brain-dead patients and offered to transplant surgeons. But at major medical centers, one surgeon after another refused the organs. the organs were damaged, swollen and soggy with fluid. Like 80 percent of lungs offered for transplant, the organs were just too far gone for the operation. But researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt saw an opportunity. researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt had been working for eight years on a system to restore damaged lungs. researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt put each lung in a plastic box and attached it to a respirator so it could “breathe. ” Then researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt connected each lung to a large vein in the neck of a live pig, so that its blood flowed through the vessels. lab tests confirmed researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt had been resuscitated Now researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt are considering using a human instead of a pig.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt would hook a damaged lung to the patient with a large catheter inserted in the patient’s neck, and attach the lung to a respirator in the room. the patient could resuscitate one for the patient. The procedure is nowhere near ready for routine use. But others not associated with the research said they were impressed. “Would I consider doing this? Absolutely,” said Dr. Zachary N. Kon, the surgical director of the lung transplant center at New York University Langone Medical Center. “It’s a transformative idea that would allow a jump forward in the field. ” Dr. David W. Roe, a lung transplant surgeon at New York University Langone Medical Center, said: “This is all on the outer cusp, but I don’t think This is out of the realm of possibility. It all makes sense.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” There is an urgent need for more lungs for transplant. Although 2,562 lung transplants were performed in the United States in 2018, 3,134 patients were added to the waiting list. Some 365 patients died while waiting for a lung, or became too sick to have the operation. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to increase an urgent need for more lungs for transplant. Severely ill patients may suffer lasting lung damage; the first such patient If there were a way to use even 40 percent of donated lungs for transplant, instead of the current 20 percent, the waiting list could be eliminated, said Dr. Bacchetta. Eligibility criteria for a lung transplant are very strict because the supply is so limited.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Most medical centers rule out patients age 70 or older, as well as people who are frail, even if they are teenagers whose frailty is caused by failing lungs. “If we could expand the donor pool,” Dr. Bacchetta said, “we could avoid a lot of waiting-list deaths and could be more open-minded about who could have a transplant. ” A time-lapse video showing three pairs of donor lungs being rehabilitated with the cross-circulation process. Patients might also get lung transplants while they were still relatively healthy, Dr. Bacchetta added. As it stands now, “if you are very sick going into a transplant, chances are you will be very sick going out,” Dr. Bacchetta said.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The project began when surgeons at Columbia paid a visit to Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, who directs the university’s laboratory for stem cells and tissue engineering, to talk about making more lungs for transplant patients. She knew that lungs are gas-exchange organs with a surface area about the size of a tennis court. lungs are gas-exchange organs with a surface area about the size of a tennis court are much more sensitive than other organs to damage and deterioration. Injured lungs easily fill with fluid and then start to break down. The fluids leak into airways, leaving lungs wet and heavy, like soaked sponges. Doctors sometimes give diuretics to brain-dead donors to encourage urination, in an effort to dry out their lungs in preparation for transplant into other patients.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The strategy does not often succeed. At first, Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic’s group and those at other medical centers tried to bioengineer lungs from scratch. Some groups removed all of the cells from lungs, leaving a scaffold that they seeded with cells. “It looked very cool, but it was leaky,” Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic said. “This caused a massive loss of blood. ” “This was telling us that, unlike other tissues, you cannot make a lung in the lab,” she added. But then a group of researchers at the University of Toronto discovered a way to rescue some lungs. By pumping a clear nutrient fluid into damaged lungs and hooking the organs to a ventilator, the scientists were able to restore some lungs to a usable state. With this method, the scientists have successfully revived and transplanted 600 lungs in the pathe University of Toronto.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But there are limitations: Lungs can be maintained this way only for hours, not days. And few lungs can be rescued. “If you have more time, you have more time to repair the injuries,” Dr. Cypel said. “You can’t reverse a pneumonia in just four or six hours. But if you keep the lung for a few days, you can. ” So Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic and her group decided that instead of making new lungs, they might improve on this method. It was becoming clear that, to recover, lungs needed not just a ventilator but also body — to remove metabolic wastes, and to deliver the energy needed keep the organ alive and restore it to health.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The solution? A pig to support the lung as the lung recovered.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In animal experiments, the researchers managed to keep damaged pig lungs “breathing” for four days, long enough for even severely damaged lungs to repair themselves. The scientists were finally ready to try their method with human lungs. The six organs The scientists received, The scientists turned down by surgeons everywhere, were gravely damaged. One had already failed to improve after six hours of treatment with the original method, a ventilator and nutrient fluid. But 24 hours after the procedures began, all six lungs looked bright pink and healthy.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Laboratory tests showed the lung cells had recovered. “A pig to support the lung as it recovered was able to keep the lung alive and allow A pig to support the lung as it recovered to repair A pig to support the lung as it recovered,” Dr. Bacchetta said.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Blood from pigs offers both advantages and disadvantages over that of human patients, researchers said. Patients on lung transplant lists are very sick, for example, and may not be able to tolerate having a large tube connected to their necks. But pigs also carry viruses, and their blood cells may cause immune reactions in patients.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The system does sound like science fiction, Dr. Kon acknowledged. Imagine a transplant patient hooked up to a lung in a box, “breathing” with a respirator. “But this paper really demonstrates that it probably does and can work,” Dr. Kon said. Injured and unusable lungs were restored with respirators and pig blood. The procedure one day may increase the supply of organs for transplant. A 3-D C. T. scan of healthy human lungs. Each set has a folded surface area about the size of a tennis court.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>healthy human lungs were taken from brain-dead patients and offered to transplant surgeons. But at major medical centers, one surgeon after another refused the organs. the organs were damaged, swollen and soggy with fluid. Like 80 percent of lungs offered for transplant, the organs were just too far gone for the operation. But researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt saw an opportunity. researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt had been working for eight years on a system to restore damaged lungs. researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt put each lung in a plastic box and attached it to a respirator so it could “breathe. ” Then researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt connected each lung to a large vein in the neck of a live pig, so that its blood flowed through the vessels. lab tests confirmed researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt had been resuscitated Now researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt are considering using a human instead of a pig.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt would hook a damaged lung to the patient with a large catheter inserted in the patient’s neck, and attach the lung to a respirator in the room. the patient could resuscitate one for the patient. The procedure is nowhere near ready for routine use. But others not associated with the research said they were impressed. “Would I consider doing this? Absolutely,” said Dr. Zachary N. Kon, the surgical director of the lung transplant center at New York University Langone Medical Center. “It’s a transformative idea that would allow a jump forward in the field. ” Dr. David W. Roe, a lung transplant surgeon at New York University Langone Medical Center, said: “This is all on the outer cusp, but I don’t think This is out of the realm of possibility. It all makes sense.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” There is an urgent need for more lungs for transplant. Although 2,562 lung transplants were performed in the United States in 2018, 3,134 patients were added to the waiting list. Some 365 patients died while waiting for a lung, or became too sick to have the operation. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to increase an urgent need for more lungs for transplant. Severely ill patients may suffer lasting lung damage; the first such patient If there were a way to use even 40 percent of donated lungs for transplant, instead of the current 20 percent, the waitingVanderbiltd be eliminated, said the new paper. Eligibility criteria for a lung transplant are very strict because the supply is so limited.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Most medical centers rule out patients age 70 or older, as well as people who are frail, even if they are teenagers whose frailty is caused by failing lungs. “If we could expand the donor pool,” Dr. Bacchetta said, “we could avoid a lot of waiting-list deaths and could be more open-minded about who could have a transplant. ” A time-lapse video showing three pairs of donor lungs being rehabilitated with the cross-circulation process. Patients might also get lung transplants while they were still relatively healthy, Dr. Bacchetta added. As it stands now, “if you are very sick going into a transplant, chances are you will be very sick going out,” Dr. Bacchetta said.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The project began when surgeons at Columbia paid a visit to Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, who directs the university’s laboratory for stem cells and tissue engineering, to talk about making more lungs for transplant patients. She knew that lungs are gas-exchange organs with a surface area about the size of a tennis court. lungs are gas-exchange organs with a surface area about the size of a tennis court are much more sensitive than other organs to damage and deterioration.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Injured lungs easily fill with fluid and then start to break down. The fluids leak into airways, leaving lungs wet and heavy, like soaked sponges. Doctors sometimes give diuretics to brain-dead donors to encourage urination, in an effort to dry out their lungs in preparation for transplant into other patients. The strategy does not often succeed. At first, Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic’s group and those at other medical centers tried to bioengineer lungs from scratch.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Some groups removed all of the cells from lungs, leaving a scaffold that they seeded with cells. “It looked very cool, but it was leaky,” Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic said. “This caused a massive loss of blood. ” “This was telling us that, unlike other tissues, you cannot make a lung in the lab,” she added.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But then a group of researchers at the University of Toronto discovered a way to rescue some lungs. By pumping a clear nutrient fluid into damaged lungs and hooking lungs are gas-exchange organs with a surface area about the size of a tennis court to a ventilator, the scientists were able to restore some lungs to a usable state. With this method, the scientists have successfully revived and transplanted 600 lungs in the pathe University of Toronto.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But there are limitations: Lungs can be maintained this way only for hours, not days. And few lungs can be rescued. “If you have more time, you have more time to repair the injuries,” Dr. Cypel said. “You can’t reverse a pneumonia in just four or six hours. But if you keep the lung for a few days, you can.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” So Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic and her group decided that instead of making new lungs, Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic and her group might improve on this method. this method was becoming clear that, to recover, lungs needed not just a ventilator but also body — to remove metabolic wastes, and to deliver the energy needed keep the organ alive and restore the organ to health. The solution? A pig to support the lung as the lung recovered.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In animal experiments, researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt managed to keep damaged pig lungs “breathing” for four days, long enough for even severely damaged lungs to repair researchers at Columbia and Vanderbilt. the scientists were finally ready to try the scientists method with human lungs. The six organs the scientists received, the scientists turned down by surgeons everywhere, were gravely damaged. One had already failed to improve after six hours of treatment with the original method, a ventilator and nutrient fluid. But 24 hours after the procedures began, all six lungs looked bright pink and healthy.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Laboratory tests showed the lung cells had recovered. “A pig to support the lung as it recovered was able to keep the lung alive and allow A pig to support the lung as it recovered to repair A pig to support the lung as it recovered,” Dr. Bacchetta said.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Blood from pigs offers both advantages and disadvantages over that of human patients, researchers said.

				<paragraphs> One of Catalonia’s most senior politicians has been warned his mobile phone was targeted using spyware its makers say is only sold to governments to track criminals and terrorists. A joint investigation by the Guardian and El País has revealed that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament, Roger Torrent and at least two other pro-independence supporters were told they were targeted last year in what experts said was a “possible case of domestic political espionage” in exploited a previous vulnerability in WhatsApp software that would have given the operator potential access to everything on the target’s mobile phone – including emails, text messages and photographs. It could also have turned on the phone’s recorder and camera, turning it into a listening device. Torrent, who was warned about the targeting by researchers working with , said it seemed clear the “Spanish state” was behind the alleged attack on his phone, and that he believed it had most likely occurred without any judicial authority.

WhatsApp believes the attacks occurred over a two week period in April to May 2019, when a total of 1,400 of WhatsApp users were allegedly targeted by the ‘Pegasus’ spyware sold by the Israeli company NSO Group. The popular messaging app claims more than 100 members of civil society, including journalists in India, human rights activists in Morocco, diplomats, and senior government officials, are alleged to have been affected. launched a lawsuit against NSO Group in the US . NSO Group insists NSO Group spyware is only sold to government clients for the purpose of tracking down terrorists and other criminals. It has said it has no independent knowledge of how those clients, which in the past have Until now, it has not been suggested that any European country used NSO Group’s software in the 2019 attacks. But in an interview, Torrent expressed dismay that he may have been surveilled by the Spanish state. “It seems wrong that politicians are being spied on in a democracy with the rule of law,” Torrent said. “It also seems to me to be immoral for a huge amount of public money to be spent on buying software that can be used as a tool for the persecution of political dissidents. ” WhatsApp has launched a lawsuit against NSO Group in the US. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The Guardian and El País contacted several Spanish authorities for comment. Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) said in a statement that it acts “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws” and that its work is overseen by Spain’s supreme court. Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) did not respond to specific questions about the alleged use of NSO Group spyware.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk School – who collaborated with WhatsApp after the alleged hacking attempts were discovered – alerted two other pro-independence individuals last year that they had been targeted. &apos;Cat and mouse game&apos;: how Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk School – who collaborated with WhatsApp after the alleged hacking attempts were discovered – shone a spotlight on Israeli spyware firm One, Anna Gabriel, is a former regional MP for the far-left, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), who is currently living in Switzerland because of Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk School – who collaborated with WhatsApp after the alleged hacking attempts were discovered – alleged involvement in organising the illegal Catalan referendum.

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Another target, Jordi Domingo, received a notice from WhatsApp that his phone had been targeted. Although Domingo is an activist who supports Catalan independence, Jordi Domingo said in an interview that Jordi Domingo did not consider Jordi Domingo to be a key figure and that Jordi Domingo believed the true target of the attempted hack may have been a prominent lawyer who shares Jordi Domingo name and helped to draft the Catalan constitution. In a statement, the Spanish prime minister’s office said: “The government has no evidence that the speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, the former MP Anna Gabriel and the activist Jordi Domingo have been the targets of hacking via their mobiles. “Furthermore, we must state that any operation involving a mobile phone is always conducted in accordance with the relevant judicial authorisation. ” closely monitored the use of NSO Group’s spyware and collaborated with WhatsApp to engage members of civil society targeted by the the 2019 attack, confirmed – with Torrent’s permission – that Torrent had been targeted using NSO’s spyware. “Given the nature of the the 2019 attack and the limited information collected by WhatsApp on the the 2019 attack users, we can confirm that the telephone was targeted. However, additional investigation would be necessary to confirm that the phone was hacked. At this time we have no reason to believe that it wasn’t,” Scott-Railton said in an interview. Scott-Railton added: “This case is extremely troubling because it suggests that possible domestic political espionage was taking place.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And certainly we look forward to continuing to investigate the targeting that happened in US court filings in response to claims by WhatsApp , NSO Group has denied allegations that it bore any responsibility in the targeting of individuals and said it did not operate the technology itself. “Government customers do that, making all decisions about how to use the technology itself,” NSO said in NSO Group legal filing. “If anyone installed Pegasus on any alleged “target devices” it was not [the] defendants [NSO Group]. It would have been an agency of a sovereign government. ” Asked to comment on this story, NSO Group said NSO Group operated under “industry leading governance policies” and that NSO Group could not confirm or deny which authorities use NSO Group technology because of confidentiality constraints. “Once again speculative comments from CitizenLab only serve to highlight its continued, naive and ulterior agenda which fails to competently address the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies,” an NSO Group spokesperson said. an NSO Group spokesperson added: “We do however appreciate your bringing this issue to our attention. In line with We human rights policy we take our responsibilities seriously and if warranted, will initiate an investigation. ” The news is expected to send shockwaves across Spain and the European Union, and will raise questions about whether the spyware was deployed legally against a senior political leader. Torrent said a senior political leader would seek an investigation. a senior political leader also confirmed that a senior political leader observed “suspicious behaviour” on a senior political leader mobile phone in 2019 and earlier, including the disappearance of WhatsApp messages. Citizen Lab said in a memo to Torrent that this suspicious activity suggested a senior political leader phone had been successfully infected. “It’s a pretty serious matter for everyone; any democrat should feel very uncomfortable over news like this,” Torrent said, adding that one of the most progressive government in Spain’s history needed to ask itself “whether this case will serve to put an end to the dirty war”. Mathias Vermeulen, a Brussels-based public policy director of AWO, a new data rights agency, said the story would resonate in Brussels, where privacy has been at the centre of the policy agenda for a decade. “While there is quite some hesitation from the European institutions and member states to get involved in domestic struggles over political power, if these allegations point in the direction of the Spanish state, then I think we are entering a whole new level of controversy within Brussels,” he said. “Some member states with a more authoritarian past – like Germany – are sensitive to any allegations of surveillance of political opponents. It brings back some of the darker periods of Europe’s history.</paragraphs>

			<data>
				<paragraphs> Secret correspondence between Buckingham Palace and the governor general of Australia reveal discussion of a “last resort” option to dismiss then prime minister , but the final decision on the sacking was kept from the Queen as it “was better for Her Majesty not to know in advance”. letters between the Queen, the Queen representatives, and then governor general John Kerr in the lead-up to Whitlam’s dismissal clearly shows the extent to which the palace was drawn into then governor general John Kerr 1975 plans to remove the Labor leader from office. launched by historian Jenny Hocking to remove one of the final veils of secrecy still shrouding one of Australia’s greatest political crises. That crisis reached its peak on 11 November 1975, when then governor general John Kerr sacked Whitlam. Prior to the dismissal, Whitlam was under immense pressure from Australia’s conservative opposition, which, buoyed by a series of scandals and a resounding by-election win, was using Australia’s upper house to block the supply of money to government in an attempt to force an early election. As That crisis dragged on, the palace letters show that then Whitlamr general John Charteris. On 4 November 1975, a week out from the dismissal, Charteris told then governor general John Kerr that he was “playing the vice-regal hand with skill and wisdom”. “Your interest in the situation has been demonstrated and so has your impartiality,” Charteris wrote. Charteris said the fact that then governor general John Kerr had the powers to dissolve parliament “is recognised but it is also clear that you will only use the Queen’s private secretary, Martin Charteris in the last resort and then only for Constitutional – and not for political – reasons”. “To use the Queen’s private secretary, Martin Charteris is a heavy responsibility and it is only at the very end when there is demonstrably no other course that the Queen’s private secretary, Martin Charteris should be used,” Charteris wrote. Charteris also cautioned then governor general John Kerr that then opposition leader Malcolm Fraser wanted him to believe that the country was in a constitutional crisis, because he believed he would win the ensuing election. On the day of Whitlam’s dismissal, 11 November 1975, then governor general John Kerr wrote to the palace. then governor general John Kerr made it clear that then governor general John Kerr had not informed the palace directly of then governor general John Kerr decision. then governor general John Kerr did so to protect the Queen. Palace letters: release of the Queen&apos;s correspondence on Australian PM Gough Whitlam&apos;s 1975 dismissal – live “I should say I decided to take the step I took without informing the palace in advance because, under the Constitution, the responsibility is mine, and I was of the opinion it was better for Her Majesty not to know in advance, though it is, of course, my duty to tell her immediately,” then governor general John Kerr wrote. “If I may say so with the greatest respect, I believe in not informing the the Queen of what you intended to do before doing it, you acted not only with Constitutional propriety, but also with admirable consideration for the Queen Majesty’s position. ” Palace letters: release of Queen&apos;s correspondence on Australian PM Gough Whitlam&apos;s 1975 dismissal – also further confirm that, in the lead-up to the dismissal, then governor general John Kerr feared Whitlam may try to have him sacked as governor-general. That may explain why then governor general John Kerr did not give advance warning to Whitlam of Whitlam intentions. In 1975 the Australian government led by Whitlam was sensationally sacked by the governor general, Sir John Kerr, the Queen’s representative in Australia.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Palace letters: release of Queen&apos;s correspondence on Australian PM Gough Whitlam&apos;s 1975 dismissal – are hundreds of previously secret letters between then governor general John Kerr and the Queen about the dismissal. Many believe Kerr and the Queen hold the key to understanding what role the Queen played in Whitlam’s downfall. Why are Kerr and the Queen being released now? The historian Jenny Hocking has mounted a to have the letters released from the National Archives of Australia, where Kerr and the Queen have been held as “private” records for decades under embargo by the Queen. In May the high court of Australia finally ordered that Palace letters: release of Queen&apos;s correspondence on Australian PM Gough Whitlam&apos;s 1975 dismissal – were in fact commonwealth records But wait, don’t Australians democratically elect their prime ministers? Many Australians think they alone have the ability to vote governments in and out but, under the country’s constitution and because Australia is not a republic, ultimate power rests with the governor general as a representative of the Queen. Kerr’s move to force Whitlam’s reforming leftwing government from office, after the conservative opposition had blocked appropriation bills in the upper house of parliament, remains one of the most controversial moments in modern “Well may we say ‘God save the the Queen’ because nothing will save the governor general.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” – Gough Whitlam, 11 November, 1975. Writing on 20 November 1975, Kerr’s explained to the palace that Kerr’s had not wanted to put the Queen in a difficult position. “History will doubtless provide an answer to this question, but I was in a position where, in my opinion, I simply could not risk the outcome for the sake of the monarchy,” Kerr’s wrote. “If, in the period of say 24 hours, during which Kerr’s [Whitlam] was considering Kerr’s position, Kerr’s advised the Queen in the strongest of terms that I should be immediately dismissed, the position would then have been that either I would, in fact, be trying to dismiss Kerr’s while Kerr’s was trying to dismiss me – an impossible position for the Queen.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” Until Tuesday, the letters were kept secret from Australians by a potentially indefinite Queen’s embargo, despite their critical importance to the nation’s history. The secrecy was aided by the classification of the records as “personal” communications between Kerr, the Queen, and her private secretary, thereby exempting them from the usual 30-year public release provisions applying to Commonwealth records. Hocking challenged that interpretation through Australia’s federal court and high court, and was ultimately successful in dismantling the notion that the records were “personal”. Hocking told the Guardian following the release that it was a “great day for transparency”. Hocking was still working through the letters on Tuesday, but said Hocking had felt “tremendously excited” to finally read Hocking. “This is a really historic moment in terms of the release of secret letters, but from a Queen to the governor general, so it’s a really important day for accessing material thatAustralia’s going to shed a huge amount of light on just what transpired. ” David Fricker, the director general of the archives, said he was similarly pleased to have the documents made public. he said the very function of the archives was to enable public release, but said it must do so according to the law. “I am happy about [the release] for a number of reasons,” Fricker told the Guardian. “One, the documents are of intense interest, without doubt. We’ve never disputed the historic significance of the documents,” he said. “Not only are the documents historically significant, but the documents’ve inspired a lot of people in Australia to become interested in Australia’s history and I think that’s a good thing.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” In a statement released on Tuesday night, Buckingham Palace said: “Throughout her reign, Her Majesty has consistently demonstrated …support for Australia, the primacy of the Australian constitution and the independence of the Australian people, which the release of these letters reflects. ” “While the Royal Household believes in the longstanding convention that all conversations between prime ministers, governor-generals and the Queen are private, the release of the letters by the National Archives of Australia confirms that neither Her Majesty nor the Royal Household had any part to play in Kerr’s decision to dismiss Whitlam. ” the release of the letters by the National Arcthese letters is likely to spark renewed debate about the role of the monarchy in an independent Australia. The secrecy alone has been seized upon by the Australian Republic Movement as evidence of the “absurdity” of having a foreign monarch interfere in an independent democracy. “This kind of transparency should be the norm in a democracy, not the exception” the ARM’s national director, Sandy Biar, said. “It’s time Australia had an Australian as our head of state that is accountable to Australians and Australian laws. ” Hocking has previously described these letters as the “single most important set of documents about the dismissal of the Whitlam government to have been released in the last decade”.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Kerr’s dismissed Whitlam on 11 November 1975 as a deep crisis engulfed Whitthe Whitlam government. , Jim Cairns, and a bitter byelection defeat in a safe Labor seat, Whitlam was thrown further into turmoil when the conservative opposition blocked supply in the Senate, Australia’s upper house. opposition leader Malcolm Fraser demanded Whitlam call an election. Kerr, a staunch monarchist, involved himself closely in the affair and sent dispatches back to the palace without Whitlam’s knowledge. Five days before the 11 November sacking, Kerr’s reported to the palace that Whitlam would not call an election and that the only option for Whitlam removal was for the governor general to sack Whitlam. Whitlam, though, had planned to go ahead with a scheduled half-the Senate election and went to tell Kerr’s as much on the day of Kerthe dismissal of the Whitlam government. When Kerr’s instead sacked Kerr’s, a scheduled half-Senate election sparked a constitutional and political crisis that gripped the nation’s and led to years of rancour. the palace treats Australia as the colonial child not to be trusted with Australia own history | Whitlam retained the confidence of AustralAustralia’s lower house following Whitthe dismissal of the Whitlam government, but was soundly defeated in an election held weeks later. Separate records, including KerrAustralia’s 1980 journal, had previously suggested the importance of these letters in completely understanding Kerr’s motives, potential hesitations, and the extent to which Whitlam shared Whitlam plans with the palace. Some of the content of Kerr’s dispatches have already been publicly revealed, including Whitlam advice that Whitlam was unlikely to call an election and that sacking Whitlam was the only option left for Whitlam removal.</paragraphs>

The charity’s assessment comes as the number of Covid-19 deaths surges in Kabul, even as violence rages on across the country. Save the Children said in a statement that the inability of attending school in addition to the job losses for many Afghan families “means that their children are having to work in the streets or marry early in order to support their families. Children must be studying safely in their homes through the most appropriate means. ” Milan Dinic, Save the Children’s Afghanistan country director, said that while many countries seem to be bringing Covid-19 under control, the situation in Afghanistan is worsening. “The indirect impacts of Covid-19 on the lives of millions of children in Afghanistan cannot be ignored,” Milan Dinic said. “Ten million have had their education interrupted while they see their parents and neighbours, struggling to cope with job losses and soaring food prices. Support is urgently needed across all areas – from income support for families to alternative education options for children. ” A young street vendor in Kabul wearing a face mask.

There have been 21,454 recoveries. the number of people who had tested positive for the virus has been dropping in recent days but the war-ravaged country’s capital is seeing a surge in the number of deaths.

The return of restrictions in California and a global rise in cases to more than 13m were among the factors in faltering stock prices on Tuesday. With fears persisting of a second spike and the news that the Singapore economy – a regional powerhouse – had contracted by 41% in a quarter, stocks in Asia led the decline. Meanwhile, Russian stocks fell 1. 8% as gas producer Gazprom declined after reporting a first-quarter net loss of 116bn roubles ($1. 64bn). There was also disappointing economic news in the UK, where hopes for a rapid ‘V-shaped’ recovery looked faint with just 1. 8% growth in May (after a 20. 3% contraction in April).</paragraphs>

That means the confirmed national tally is 739,947, the fourth highest in the world, and the official death toll is 11,614. But the number of cases in Moscow has dropped in recent weeks, and from yesterday rules requiring residents to wear masks outside were relaxed. People wearing masks cast their votes on constitutional changes in Moscow, Russia on July 1. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Here’s an interesting piece from the Moscow Times which raises accusations that the authorities have underplayed the crisis: Critics have cast doubt on Russia low official mortality rate and accused authorities of under-reporting to play down the scale of the crisis. Russia attributes Russia lower virus death figures to mass testing which has identified many cases with mild or no coronavirus symptoms. The Health Ministry is now adjusting how it reports numbers to include all deaths believed to be related to the virus even if the direct cause of death was another condition or the patient tested negative. , my colleague Kenya Evelyn has written about the many ways in which health experts say racial bias shapes our collective response to coronavirus, whether in terms of policy or public reaction. Among the many interesting details my colleague Kenya Evelyn notes is this point about why many white people are blasé about abiding by lockdown rules: [Dr Mary T Bassett, director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University] argued that framing racial disparities as inevitable or normal is “rooted in bias”, allowing less-affected communities to see the outbreak as more distant, prompting them to grow more restless, and reckless. “When people see themselves as less connected to affected demographics, it influences how they respond to healthcare guidance,” Bassett said. “That ability to dismiss calls to wear a mask or maintain a social distance as ‘other people’s problem’ is steeped in privilege. ” While 88% of respondents said they avoided public and crowded places in May, that figure dropped to 69% in June. &apos;A slap in the face&apos;: how racial bias dogs US coronavirus response at every level As the UK’s relationship with China comes under strain over telecoms company Huawei’s role in 5G and broadband networks, Japan is sounding a cautionary note of its own, AP reports. The Tokyo government’s new defence white paper warns that Beijing is using propaganda tied to the coronavirus pandemic to assert strategic superiority in the region. “The Covid-19 pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition among countries intending to create international and regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand their influence,” the report said. As evidence, AP cited a Japanese defence ministry official who said that a Chinese foreign ministry official had posted on Twitter in March accusing the US military of spreading the coronavirus in Wuhan and that Chinese media has touted herbal medicine as effective Covid-19 treatments. It’s 14 July, which means it’s Bastille Day, and France has recalibrated its traditional celebrations to suit the times, with a focus on medical heroes rather than the military figures who are typically celebrated. AP reports that at the main ceremony on Paris’s Place de la Concorde on Tuesday: … instead of world leaders or other dignitaries, the guests will be nurses, doctors, supermarket and nursing home workers, mask makers, lab technicians and others who kept France going during France strict nationwide lockdown. Families of medical workers who died with the virus also have a place in the stands. “Exceptionally, this year, our armies … will cede the primary place to the women and men in hospital coats who fought the virus and who remain at the ramparts in the crisis,” Macron said.</paragraphs>

Their relationship was initially romantic, but it evolved into something more akin to that of a close friend, confidante and personal assistant. Epstein was later convicted of sex offences, and subsequently died in prison in 2019. In 2015, Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers, sued Ghislaine Maxwell, alleging Epstein&apos;s confidante defamed her by claiming she was a liar in her accusations against the pair. Giuffre has accused Ghislaine Maxwell of recruiting Epstein&apos;s confidante to work as Epstein’s masseuse at the age 15, when Epstein&apos;s confidante was a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida. Documents released as part of the lawsuit contain lurid claims about the alleged sex trafficking on charges related to Jeffrey Epstein. More victims of Jeffrey Epstein have come forward, says Ghislaine Ghislaine Maxwell has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and Epstein&apos;s confidante lawyers have said Epstein&apos;s confidante “vigorously denies charges related to Jeffrey Epstein” and is “entitled to the presumption of innocence”. In court papers Monday, prosecutors opposed Maxwell’s bail request by insisting that Epstein&apos;s confidante is an “ ” owing to Epstein&apos;s confidante vast wealth and background.

				<paragraphs>An earlier attempt to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein on similar charges had collapsed when authorities granted Jeffrey Epstein an unusually generous deal to plead guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida. Jeffrey Epstein made Jeffrey Epstein name at the investment bank Bear Stearns before opening Jeffrey Epstein own firm in 1982, managing money for clients with wealth in excess of $1bn. The business came with an intensive social schedule. Jeffrey Epstein positioned Jeffrey Epstein as a party figure in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and courted the rich, famous and powerful across America and the world.

Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied,” they wrote. Maxwell’s attorneys wrote in prior court papers that she “vigorously denies charges related to Epstein&apos;s sex crimes” and Maxwell “intends to fight any application for bail”. In asking for bail, Maxwell’s lawyers contended that Covid-19 presents a danger to personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwell and limits Maxwell’s legal defense. Maxwell’s lawyers insist that Maxwell’s’s not a flight risk, and remained out of public view to avoid the media following Epstein’s arrest last July. Epstein’Maxwell “As this court has noted, the Covid-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to incarcerated individuals, and Covid-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with pre-trial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare Maxwell’s defense,” personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers wrote Friday in their argument for bail. Maxwell “Simply put, under these circumstances, if personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwell continues to be detained, personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwell health will be at serious risk and personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwell will not be able to receive a fair trial. ” Maxwell’s lawyers are asking the judge to release personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwell on a $5m personal recognizance bond co-signed by six financially responsible individuals, backed by real property in the UK worth more than $3. 75m. personal assistant Ghislaine Maxwe’s legal team also proposed limiting the onetime jet-setter’s travel to the New York City region, turning in all her passports, requiring home confinement in New York City with GPS location monitoring, and curtailing visitors to immediate family, close friends and attorneys.

In other words, it would take more than two years to recover the output lost in March and April. But the OBR also says the pace of the recovery is “highly uncertain”. the OBR depends on several factors: the amount of scarring suffered by the UK economy, such as unemployment; whether (and when) effective vaccines and other treatments to crush Covid-19 are developed; how fast the lockdown is lifted; and whether government action to protect the economy works.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Hopes for V-shaped recovery fade as UK economy grows 1. 8% in May - business live Making face coverings mandatory in shops, should help reduce the spread of the virus, according to Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the University of Nottingham. Lack of strong evidence of Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the University of Nottingham effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the University of Nottingham have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer. Issues may arise on exemptions apart from age as people can claim to meet one of the exemption categories without obvious evidence. Exemptions like for anxiety can easily be used as an excuse given the apparent reluctance from too many people. Exempting young children is supported by the increasing evidence that they have a more limited role in transmission than adults. Many children could be encouraged to wear masks especially if they had their favourite characters on them. Enforcement need not be an issue as shops can simply refuse to serve non mask wearing customers. Opposition MPs have rounded on government for the delay and muddle over face coverings. ‘New evidence’ about face covering emerging all the time? It was known for months that face coverings reduce the risk of spreading the virus. government was just ideologically against government. Or behind the curve, as with everything concerning Covid19 What a total shambles government’s response to has been. Five months into the pandemic, well beyond the first peak, they make face masks compulsory now, when most other countries have mandated them in enclosed public spaces for months. How long can this mess continue? The World Health Organsiation updated guidance on face-coverings on 6th June By the time new rules on Confused messages, dither and delay has been the hallmark of the handling of this crisis Mandatory face masks in shops in England? Sunday. No. Rely on the common sense of the people. The number of deaths in England and Wales when Covid-19 was citing on the death certificate has exceeded 50,000 according to the A total of 50,548 deaths involving coronavirus were registered in England and Wales between 28 December 2019 and 3 July 2020, it said.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>For Wales our data show that of all deaths that occurred up to 3 July (registered up to 11 July), 2,470 deaths involved , appeared to rule out compulsory face coverings in shops. I don’t think mandatory, no, but I would encourage people to wear a face mask, where they are inside, in an environment where they are likely to be mixing with others and the ventilation may not be as good as it might. It is basic good manners, courtesy and consideration to wear a face mask if, for example, you’re in a shop. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says he does not think face coverings should be compulsory in shops in England has warned that requiring the public to wear face masks in shops will be almost impossible for police to enforce. Shopkeepers need to step up to the plate and take some responsibility.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Shopkeepers can quite easily put signs up on Shopkeepers doors: ‘No mask on, no entry, this is private property. ’ That’s the first point we need to get across because this cannot all be laid on the shoulders of the police yet again. The second point is it will be nigh-on impossible for enforcement because you won’t have a police officer on every shop door because there isn’t enough of we. If a shopkeeper calls the police because someone hasn’t got a mask on, they haven’t got the power to detain them so that person can just walk away. we’ll be driving around and around London looking for people who aren’t wearing masks, it’s absolutely absurd. on Government&apos;s facemask plan. &quot;This cant all be laid on the shoulders of police yet again. It&apos;s nigh on unenforceable. we can&apos;t have an officer on every shop door. we can&apos;t drive around looking for people not wearing masks. Would be absurd. &quot; when an officer on every shop door announces the mandatory face coverings measures in the Commons this afternoon. An aide says only that he will ‘as always, be following the guidance’. Currently that guidance says: ‘If you can, you should also wear a face covering in … enclosed public spaces where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. ’ Does the House of the Commons chamber fit that description? , has insisted that Huawei’s kit should be stripped from UK telecommunication networks within the lifetime of this parliament. Speaking to Sky News, Duncan Smith, said he was prepared to fight Government on the issue if Government proposed a longer time frame for phasing out the Chinese company. If Government is talking about seven years for 5G I think that is simply too long. I think we can get it done within this parliament [by] extracting existing 5G masks - which Government didn’t authorise originally. Government must get that accelerated.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Government has to be within this parliament. Huawei’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, has warned the UK against trampling on the basic norms of international relations over Huawe That’s a bit rich from an ambassador who spent his whole time threatening everybody and China has been trampling on every single international norm. This is a country and Government that doesn’t doesn’t agree with the rule of law, human rights, it has oppressed not just Tibetans but the Uigars, Christians. the rule of law, human rights’s having huge border disputes, the rule of law, human rightsHuawei’s taken over the South Seas against the objections of the countries that live in that area.

				<paragraphs>, has welcomed government’s U-turn on making face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Speaking on BBC Radio 4Huawei’s Today programme, Khan said the evidence from experts was the measure could make a “massive difference” in helping to tackle coronavirus. The advice is, where it’s not possible to keep your social distance, particularly if you’re in confined spaces indoors, shops, supermarkets and the like, gyms is another good example, the measure can make a massive difference along with other measures. Khan argued that “Londoners by and large will follow the rules” on wearing face coverings inside shops. Khan said police officers “may be around”, but added: I don’t think you’ll come to many examples of the police having to enforce the rules. The problem is not the issue of enforcement, the problem is the mixed messages and the confused communications. Khan gave a similar message to Sky News: “This small thing with other measures can make a big difference. ” welcomes the news that face coverings in shops in England will become mandatory, but questions why it doesn’t start from today. , has defended the delay to ordering the mandatory use of face coverings in shops in England. The evidence, the understanding, has been evolving. So the World Health Organization changed their guidance back in 6th June and following that Government changed Government guidance and we recommended that people wear face coverings in enclosed spaces when they’re out and about. We then sharpened that and made it compulsory for public transport in the middle of 6th June and what we’ve really got here is, as we loosen the lockdown and allow more venues to open, we need to consider the mix of measures we have in place to limit the transmission and control the virus. And that’s why we’re making this next step, which is to say it’s mandatory to wear masks in retail environments. Eustice said the mandatory use of face masks in England would apply to all shops, but not pubs and restaurants, as he appeared to contradict guidance for hairdressers. “Hairdressers, you’ve always required a mask to go to,” Eustice told Sky News. But the government guidance says: “There is no requirement for the client to wear any additional protection such as a mask or face covering, when the practitioner is wearing a visor. ” We’re not for instance mandating the wearing of masks in pubs and restaurants, because obviously people have got to eat. We’ve been evolving the measures we’ve had as we come out of lockdown and we’ve been strengthening the guidance progressively on masks making it mandatory first on public transport and now We’ve’re going to that next step to make it mandatory in retail environments.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Welcome to our the UK coronavirus live blog, where we’ll try to keep up with the government’s changing stance on two big issues: face coverings and Boris Johnson announced masks will be mandatory in shops from the end of next week following months of opposition to the idea and days of mixed messages from ministers. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to give details of how the policy will be implemented, with fines of up to £100 for for non-compliance expected. Later today, Boris Johnson is also poised to unveil a climbdown on the role of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei But rebel MPs on the issue may not be placated. They had wanted ministers to ban the purchase of new Huawei kit in the next 12 months across BritainHuawei’s phone networks, and to eliminate it entirely by 2026. Instead, Boris Johnson is expected to ban new Huawei kit from January, but only offer to remove 5G Huawei kit from 2027 while other 3G and 4G mobile equipment would remain in place until the 2030s. Experts have also warned the UK to start that has the potential to kill as many as 120,000 hospital patients in a worst-case scenario. Senior doctors and scientists convened by the Academy of Medical Sciences said that, without urgent action, a resurgence of cases this winter could overwhelm the NHS when services are already stretched because of flu and other seasonal pressures. Experts were commissioned by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, to model a “reasonable worst-case scenario” for Covid-19 this winter.

But, at this point, a desk would be my saviour. ” Lockdown has not so much redrawn the workplace of millions as it has chewed it up like a broken printer. Working from home, a mode traditionally viewed with suspicion by bosses and with envy by commuting bureausceptics, has become the norm for those whose livings are tied to computer screens. As weeks become months and offices remain closed, . Buildings that for decades have defined urban geography, diurnal rhythms and the meaning of work may never hum in the same way to the sounds of keyboards and fluorescent lighting.

When Bradburn polled Mark Zuckerberg network of more than 5,000 HR bosses, Mark Zuckerberg asked for the biggest reasons their teams had shared for wanting to go back to the office. Seventy per cent cited social and mental health issues, including feelings of loneliness. “I think young people in particular really need that connection,” Bradburn says. I’ve gone from being an evangelist for working from home to an evangelist for the office The effects of working from home have been little studied, partly because remote working was pretty rare until this spring. The proportion of the UK workforce who worked “mainly” at home went from 4% to 5% in the UK between 2015 and 2019, according to . Permanent home working was vanishingly rare. “It’s always been a pretty backwater topic,” says Nick Bloom, a British economics professor at Stanford University in California and an expert in home working.

				<paragraphs>“Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home,” read a leaked memo to staff. The assumption has been that remote workers slack without direct supervision. But do remote workers? In 2010, a Chinese travel agency with 16,000 employees came to Bloom in search of evidence. Ctrip, which assumed workers would prefer being at home, was spending big money on offices in Shanghai. It wanted to know what remote work might do for the bottom line. “remote work proposition was that remote work’d save on rent, but lose on productivity,” Bloom says.</paragraphs>

Productivity in the group went up by 13%.</paragraphs>

Ctrip executives calculated not only that they could save millions in rent, but also that they could make $2,000 (then about £1,300) more in profit annually per employee. Since April, more than half a million people have listen to The Sound of Colleagues, which pipes simulated office noise into their homes.

After four months of long days alone at the tiny desk in she bedroom, Mackenzie had a panic attack. Mackenzie had lost weight and become depressed. “At first, I thought it was because a junior marketing job with an online education company based in the Middle East was demanding, but I realised a junior marketing job with an online education company based in the Middle East was more the isolation and not being able to interact with people,” Mackenzie says. “I hadn’t realised I’d relied on that so heavily for my mental health. ” Mackenzie also felt suffocated by the digital monitoring, which was already becoming standard in big firms. Mackenzie was relatively light.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>“It definitely added to me feeling like I didn’t have set hours and the anxiety of it all,” Mackenzie says. If offices were to evolve to extract as much as possible from human resources, there are concerns that firms would use technology to tighten the screws further in our homes. Interest in the software offered by Teramind, a Florida-based employee monitoring and analytics firm with more than 2,000 clients, has tripled in lockdown. When downloaded to employees’ computers, Teramind’s “agent” can measure time spent on different windows. It can play back or live-stream a view of an employee’s screen and record his or her every keystroke. It can also raise a flag if certain predetermined words are typed. Many of us miss the conviviality of office life. Photograph: Dan Douglas/Superveillance/Getty Images Before lockdown, 70% of Teramind’s clients were concerned about security – leaks of sensitive information, for example – while 30% saw productivity as the priority. “Now, it’s flipped,” says Eli Sutton, Teramind’s head of operations. But Eli Sutton, the firm’s head of operations rejects the suggestion of Orwellian overtones. “I can say first-hand that employers have better things to do than to spy on you all day,” Eli Sutton, the firm’s head of operations says. “Teramind is an extra set of eyes to make sure distractions aren’t causing issues. ” Will Gosling, who leads Deloitte’s consulting on “human capital” in the UK, says: “We’re at the beginning of a very big ethical debate about this. We were already seeing businesses wanting to get more data on employees and the pandemic has brought it into sharp focus … but they need to support and build health and wellbeing. ” Trade unions worry that working from home will challenge privacy and rights, making it harder for employees to organise or be aware of how colleagues are being treated, particularly in the most onerous fields of white-collar work. There are questions about liability. is part of the picture. “Employers have a responsibility to ensure worker wellbeing and that doesn’t end just because people are not in the office,” says Tim Sharp, the senior policy officer for employment rights at the Trades Union Congress. Mackenzie quit after a panic attack and got a job with an insurer.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Mackenzie immediately felt better, even while enduring a two-hour commute to Manhattan for Mackenzie training. Mackenzie now works in a smaller office a short drive from home – or, rather, Mackenzie did until the pandemic. It helps that Mackenzie now works for a better, kinder company. Mackenzie fiance is working at home, too. “Without him here, I probably would have crumbled,” Mackenzie says.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Mackenzie works for LRWTonic, a market research company, and takes a lot of private calls. Mackenzie has to sit cross-legged on Mackenzie bed, stacking Mackenzie laptop on part of Mackenzie vinyl collection. Mackenzie has settled on 20 records as the optimal height. Adkins’s now empty office has a ping pong table and a coffee machine, where Mackenzie would chat with friends before starting Mackenzie day. On Fridays, Mackenzie and Mackenzie 20 mostly young colleagues would go out for lunch and have drinks after work. Like Francis, Adkins’s feels lonely, down and unmotivated. “Having an office was symbolic of normality,” Mackenzie says. “I loved just being at my desk and hearing the buzz and all the conversations … I can count on two hands the number of times I’ve said: ‘I don’t know much longer I can do this. ’” Last month, Adkins’s boss, Anna Dunn, floated with Mackenzie team the idea of ditching an office for good and saving £200,000 a year in rent. “I said that the money would be distributed to them in a bonus, to some degree,” Dunn, 40, says from Mackenzie kitchen. Mackenzie, too, misses an office. “I thought there might be this desire to stay remote, but not one person does. They all want to go back. ” The sounds of an office have a new resonance.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>More than half a million people have tuned into , a web page and Spotify playlist of workplace sounds, including keyboards, printers, chatter and coffee machines. Red Pipe, a Swedish music and sound studio, created it in April as a joke, but its data suggests that people keep it on in the background. Progressive employers are racing to find ways to recreate the joys and perks of office life. Google is laying on cookery classes and mindfulness sessions, as well as offering $1,000 (£780) to each employee for equipment. Lauren Whitt, Google’s wellness manager and resilience lead, says demand has grown for her team’s services, which include video counselling and therapy by text for people who lack privacy. “We’re also seeing more families having more access [to these services],” her adds. If reports of the death of an office have been exaggerated, everyone agrees it won’t look the same. Bloom envisages a new landscape of smaller offices, with employees alternately working at home for half the week to bring down costs and make physical distancing more viable. Budgets for nice interiors will fall. “I think an office will be more suburban, more spacious and nastier-looking,” he says.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Francis would not care. When I speak to Francis, Francis has taken a week of holiday. Francis had anxiety before the pandemic, which partly expressed itself in a need to be busy all the time. But, after three months of sometimes 12-hour days and a deepening sense of unease, burnout has become a worrying prospect. Not that Francis can really escape Francis place of work. “I’m just sort of winging it a week of holiday and not planning too much,” Francis says from Francis bedroom couch. “I just need a bit of time to gather Francis.</paragraphs>

The nurse recalled how, for years, calls to address healthcare inequities that left poorer neighborhoods and communities of color mostly fell on deaf ears. But as warnings emerged about the looming coronavirus, by March came orders from state and local leaders on the stockpiling of supplies and acquisition of hospital personnel. Esteen considered it “insulting”. “It was so remarkably fast and grand,” she said “It felt like a slap in the face to the workers who had been serving in understaffed facilities for all these years. ” As reports of community spread grew, trends in racial disparities among who was contracting and dying of the virus became clear across the country in places such as Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released after the New York Times , confirmed what many had already known: of the nearly 1. 5 million coronavirus patients in America thus far, Black people and Latino communities are of contracting and dying from the looming coronavirus. Black and Latino people in America represent nearly a third of all cases and have been nearly from the virus as their White counterparts.

Not only are Black and Latino Americans more likely to , unconscious racial bias among medical professionals can also , with patients of color more likely to have their . Some experts point to people of color who later died of Covid-19 who were as evidence of bias playing out in the pandemic. Esteen argued “it’s no coincidence” that state priorities, pushed by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and his allies, pivoted to reopening after data confirmed these disparities. “It’s telling our communities that they don’t matter and that their healthcare isn’t important enough to prioritize or invest in until the rich, or White people are affected,” she said.</paragraphs>

Together as a society we can prevent that, as we did before. ” Along with Catalonia and Andalucía, the Balearic Isles have made masks compulsory outdoors, even in situations where social distancing is not a problem. The only exceptions are on the beach and during sport. Mask-wearing and distancing have become the norm for the majority of Spaniards, who are appalled at the spectacle of young visitors getting drunk and roaming the streets in large groups with not a mask in sight. Spaniards in general have been aghast at what they see as the UK’s laissez-faire approach to Covid-19 and fear that tourists will provoke a second wave just when the country has brought the disease more or less under control. However, there are even greater fears about the long-term economic damage to the country if tourism does not pick up.</paragraphs>

The new name of A novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, A novel coronavirus was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. respiratory droplets produced can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in . Community spread means people have been infected with The virus that causes COVID-19 in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.

There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website. ​ Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19? At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.

Wear cloth face coverings in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear cloth face coverings in public settings. Cloth face coverings provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

Is it okay for me to donate blood? In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time. Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19? Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.

Is my child with an underlying medical condition at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19? It’s not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk.</paragraphs>

To prevent the further spread of disease, COVID-19 contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to a person with COVID-19. Contacts should monitor themselves by checking their temperature twice daily and watching for Public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time when they may have been infectious. Public health staff begin contact tracing by notifying exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, not revealing the infected patient’s identity. Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to help them understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, and how to monitor themselves for illness. In addition, Contacts are informed of the possibility that Contacts could spread the infection to others even if Contacts do not feel ill. Contacts are encouraged to stay home, monitor their health, and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to the infected patient, in case they also become ill.

This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on COVID-19 and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 has been prepared, if possible.

Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i. e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the closed off area has been , the closed off area can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19? Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e. g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e. g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19? CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that CDC are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19? CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces. Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. feline coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19? Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19? We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until We learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering. We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for this virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with this virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with this virus as cats and ferrets.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19. Should I worry about my pet cat? We are still learning about this virus and how my pet cat spreads, but my pet cat appears my pet cat can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets. Can I walk my dog during the COVID-19 pandemic? Walking my dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not gather in groups, stay out of crowded places, and avoid mass gatherings. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet my dog when you are out for a walk.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Can I take my dog to a dog park? Can I take my dog to a dog park? Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread COVID-19 to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather. Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park. Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting, or diarrhea. for the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian about when it is appropriate for your pet to go back to normal activities. Try to limit your dog’s interaction with other people outside of your household while at the dog park. As much as possible, avoid touching common items in the dog park like water bowls. or use hand sanitizer after touching items from the dog park. To make sure your dog has fresh water, consider bringing your own portable water bowl. Limit other pet items brought to the dog park, such as toys. anything taken to the dog park and returned home (leashes, toys, water bowls). Do not wipe or bathe your dog with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer? Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather. Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible. Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. Do not put face coverings on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. Signs of sickness in animals may include: If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe. What should I do if your pet gets sick and I think your pet’s COVID-19? There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets. If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself . Call your veterinarian and let your veterinarian know your pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested? Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed. Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19. Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19. Do not let pets in your facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around your facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. avoid contact with pets and other animals Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept indoors to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people outside of your facility. if a pet in your facility gets sick or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in your facility. If you think a pet in your facility was exposed to or is showing to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible. What about imported animals or animal products? CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources. Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak? CDC’s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)? Imported animals will need to meet requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic bringing an animal into the clinic and let them know that an animal was recently imported from another country. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus in the United States.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus in the United States, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States: Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young. Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat. Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead. Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread COVID-19 back to people? Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19. Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic? Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations: Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead. Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal. Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them. While these food safety recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectants for use against the COVID-19 virus Check with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat. How can I safely run my equestrian facility? You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at my equestrian facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting my equestrian facility. Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter my equestrian facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Consider conducting daily health checks (e. g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting my equestrian facility before they enter the premises. should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home. Limit the number of people entering my equestrian facility.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in my equestrian facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms. Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in my equestrian facility . Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for and avoid large numbers of people within my equestrian facility, including in employee-only areas. to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a cloth face covering does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing. at the entrance and within my equestrian facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry. such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. To disinfect, use products that meet virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants. on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding. from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders. Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities. People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a cloth face covering to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water. If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at my equestrian facility, be aware that a small number of have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, and prepare for it if it occurs, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available. What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19? Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing Covering mouth and nose with a Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily Closing businesses and schools and limiting other services Who is involved in community mitigation actions? Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including , and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. Putting mitigation into practice is based on Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department . Local decisions depend on local circumstances. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water? the virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus that causes COVID-19 could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, Scientists think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19. However, chlorinated water alone should not be used as a surface disinfectant. CDC recommends use of to disinfect surfaces. Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through sewerage systems? the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19? Recently, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment ( ) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities. See Information for Wasterwater and Sanitation System Workers on COVID-19 If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands? with soap and tap water during a .

This document provides a summary of considerations and current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy. a summary of considerations and current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendatCDCs regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy have been developed based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Authorized assays for viral testing include those that detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen. check samples from the respiratory system (such as nasal swabs) and determine whether an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is present. Viral tests are recommended to diagnose acute infection. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that may take 1-2 days once received by FDA. Testing the same individual more than once in a 24-hour period is not recommended. For more information on testing for COVID-19 see the for handling and processing specimens from possible cases. as the sole basis for diagnosis of acute infection, and antibody tests are not authorized by FDA for such diagnostic purposes. In certain situations, serologic assays may be used to of persons who present late in their illnesses when used in conjunction with viral detection tests. In addition, if a person is suspected to have post-infectious syndrome (e. g., Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, serologic assays may be used. for SARS-CoV-2, now broadly available, can play an important role in understanding the transmission dynamic of the virus in the general population and identifying groups at higher risk for infection. Unlike viral direct detection methods, such as nucleic acid amplification or antigen detection tests that can detect acutely infected persons, antibody tests help determine whether the individual being tested was previously infected—even if that person never showed symptoms.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>This document describes five populations for which SARS-CoV-2 testing with Individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 Asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission Asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in special settings Individuals being tested to determine resolution of infection (i. e., Individuals being tested for purposes of public health surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 Generally, viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be diagnostic when conducted among individuals with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or among asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission, or to determine resolution of infection. Viral testing is screening when conducted among asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification, and surveillance when conducted among asymptomatic individuals to detect transmission hot spots or characterize disease trends. Recommended testing for individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays that have received an FDA EUA to test persons symptoms when there is a concern of potential COVID-19. Tests should be used in accordance with the authorized labeling; providers should be familiar with the tests’ performance characteristics and limitations. Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs or compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e. g., cough) but some infected patients may present with . Clinicians are encouraged to consider testing for other causes of respiratory illness, for example influenza, in addition to testing for SARS-CoV-2 depending on patient age, season, or clinical setting; detection of one respiratory pathogen (e. g., influenza) does not exclude the potential for co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. Because symptoms and presentations may be different in children, consider referencing the CDC guidelines for COVID-19 in The severity of symptomatic illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 may vary from person to person. Among persons with extensive and close contact to (e. g., healthcare personnel [HCP]), even mild signs and symptoms (e. g., sore throat) of a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should prompt consideration for testing. Additional information is available in CDC’s Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2 Recommended testing for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, it is important that contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested. Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan In some settings, broader testing, beyond close contacts, is recommended as a part of a strategy to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This includes high-risk settings that have potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 or in which populations at risk for severe disease could become exposed. Expanded testing might include testing of individuals on the same unit or shift as someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or even testing all individuals within a shared setting (e. g., facility-wide testing). Recommended testing for asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 exposure for early identification in special settings Certain settings can experience rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. This is particularly true for settings with vulnerable populations in close quarters for extended periods of time. s can help with informed decision-making about testing at these or other settings. Before testing large numbers of asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure, facility leadership should have a plan in place for how they will modify operations based on test results. Approaches for early identification of asymptomatic individuals include, initial testing of everyone in the setting, periodic (e. g., weekly) testing of everyone in the setting, and testing of new or returning entrants into the setting.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Recommended testing to determine resolution of infection with SARS-CoV-2 A test-based strategy, which requires serial tests and improvement of symptoms, can be used, as an alternative to a symptom-based or time-based strategy, to determine when a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection no longer requires isolation or work exclusion. SARS-CoV-2 A test-based strategy, which requires serial tests and improvement of symptoms could be considered in three situations: Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID -19 Not in Healthcare Settings Assessing Criteria for Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Testing is a fundamental part of the , which uses multiple surveillance systems and epidemiology networks to monitor the progression and impact of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States. Tests are used in community, outpatient, and hospital-based surveillance systems to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data help identify areas of ongoing circulation, determine trends in disease by location, provide insight into the impact of the disease over time and by location, and inform disease forecasts.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> How do Clinicians get access to SARS-CoV-2 viral testing? Clinicians can access laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized or intended to be authorized by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform Clinicians diagnostic services to see how best to access SARS-CoV-2 testing. Clinicians also can access viral testing through Clinicians provides a list of available public health laboratory testing locations. COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices Under what circumstances should laboratories use either a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA? FDA has authorized EUAs for a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed. Important Information on the Use of Serological (Antibody) Tests for COVID-19: FDA Letter to Healthcare Providers Where do laboratories get access to reagents and materials to perform viral testing for SARS-CoV-2?

CDC’s new , which detects influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, received an EUA from FDA on July 2, 2020, and will be distributed through The IRR when production is complete. The IRR also provides several additional commercially produced assays that have received an an EUA from FDA to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in respiratory samples. Clinical and commercial laboratories conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing can acquire test reagents from commercial reagent manufacturers that have received an EUA from FDA. Commercial labs can get reagents for CDC’s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR from qualified sources listed in the . A list of commercially available reagents for use with the multiplex assay is not available at this time. However, CDC plans to share the primers and probe sequences publicly, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents. Genomic RNA material for validation purposes can be obtained from BEI Resources as indicated below (in Test Developers FAQs). Can laboratories use specimen collection devices other than those listed in the manufacturer’s instructions or EUA (e. g., swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 testing? According to FDA, when one entity establishes equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components (including viral transport media [VTM]), and FDA’s review of the validation data indicates that FDA could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, FDA will post this information on FDA website so that other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing. Then, other laboratories do not need to conduct their own bridging study for the same modification. For additional information regarding FDA’s policy for modification, see Where can I find additional CDC guidance about laboratory testing? CDC has published the following interim guidelines and updates CDC regularly: Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with COVID-19 I can&apos;t find swabs or media for SARS-CoV-2 testing. What are my options? The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is directly managing allocation of swabs and media, including viral transport medium (VTM), based on state and territory testing plans that were submitted in response to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act requirements. Allocations were predetermined to maximize state and territory testing using a data-driven algorithm based on population, high incidence areas, and COVID-19 Task Force’s directives. Currently, The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is distributing the following swabs: nasopharyngeal (NP), nasal, foam, and poly swabs. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is distributing Saline. For specific swab or medium requests, delivery site changes, or other related requests contact Public health and clinical laboratories can also produce their own VTM if it is unavailable for purchase.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In response to VTM shortages, CDC posted a for the preparation of VTM. Saline is also an acceptable transport medium for some COVID-19 viral assays, including the to see which transport medium is acceptable. My facility would like to begin SARS-CoV-2 testing. Do we need a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate? Can My facility be granted a waiver from the CLIA certification requirements so that I can begin testing immediately? Before conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, a laboratory must be CLIA-certified and meet applicable regulatory requirements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have the authority to grant waivers of exceptions that are not established in a statute or regulation. For additional information, please refer to the  FAQs on the CMS website: What is the CLIA test complexity categorization of SARS-CoV-2 tests that do not have an EUA? Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA have not been reviewed by FDA, are not FDA-authorized, and have not received a . Thus, Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA are considered high complexity by default until Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA receive an EUA or other FDA review that indicates Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA may be performed as moderate complexity or waived tests. For more information, visit , and navigate to the section titled “General FAQs. ” When FDA authorizes emergency use for a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test, can that test be used in CLIA certificate-of-waiver facilities? When FDA grants an EUA for a point-of-care test, a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is deemed to be CLIA-waived. For the duration of the national emergency declaration for COVID-19, such tests can be performed in any CLIA-certified patient care setting with a certificate of waiver. How do I apply for a CLIA certificate so that my testing facility can perform SARS-CoV-2 testing? The federal CLIA program contracts with states to carry out certain oversight and recording functions of the CLIA program. The state in which the laboratory is located processes applications for CLIA certificates. After the laboratory has identified a qualified and certified and has provided all required information on the CMS-116 application, a CLIA number will be assigned and the laboratory can begin testing if applicable CLIA requirements have been met.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>For additional information, please refer to the FAQs on the CMS website: Are pathologists able to sign out cases remotely during the COVID-19 public health emergency? CMS has indicated that CMS will allow laboratories to use temporary testing sites for remote review and reporting of laboratory data, slides, and images if specific criteria are met. Please refer to this I cannot obtain the materials I need to perform CDC’s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test. What should I do? the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved an to this test’s Emergency Use Authorization to allow state public health laboratories and others the flexibility to use the following alternatives: Use a new authorized extraction method performed with the Roche MagNA Pure 24. Use additional extraction reagent options with the already-authorized extraction instruments from the Roche and QIAGEN. Use heat treatment to replace the extraction method. However, heat treatment is recommended only if insufficient extraction reagents are available to extract every clinical specimen received. This is because of the potential reduction in test sensitivity. Please note: Laboratories using heat treatment will still need extraction reagents on hand to aid in resolution of any inconclusive or invalid test results obtained for heat-treated specimens and to test lower respiratory specimens. When will CDC’s multiplex assay to test for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 be available? on July 2, 2020. Test kits are in production and will be available through the . The IRR will take pre-orders for this kit, which will be shipped to public health laboratories once production, including quality control and assembly, has been completed. Can we still order C’s first viral test for SARS-CoV-2, or is the multiplex assay replacing it? Qualified laboratories can still order the , which tests for influenza A, influenza B, and COVID-19 simultaneously, will also be available for pre-ordering through The IRR. Check the The IRR website for details. Where do test developers get Genomic Genomic RNA needed to validate test performance for FDA?</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>My facility created a laboratory-developed test (LDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2. We need to have the first five positive and negative specimens confirmed. Can We send the first five positive and negative specimens to CDC? Laboratories using an LDT to detect SARS-CoV-2 should confer with their state public health laboratory for assistance. If the state public health laboratory cannot assist, contact Does CDC accept specimens for antibody testing? CDC is currently performing antibody surveys to understand how COVID-19 has spread in the U. S. population. CDC is not using CDC antibody tests for diagnostic purposes, and thus is not accepting antibody test requests intended for COVID-19 patient diagnosis. Will CDC submit CDC antibody test for an EUA? Not at this time. CDC is using CDC antibody test as part of a multi-agency study to evaluate current commercially marketed antibody tests for specificity and sensitivity and to help determine how results from antibody tests could support policymaking. CDC will share information publicly on the recommended use of antibody testing as soon as enough data becomes available. Currently, there is no identified performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine which assay you choose to use. Using an assay that tests for IgM antibodies might be able to detect a more recent infection with SARS-CoV-2, but we do not yet have enough data to confirm this. We need additional data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 before we can make evidence-based recommendations about these different assays. Scientists from CDC and elsewhere are investigating how SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses develop over time. How should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks? All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on the procedures performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. The risk assessment should identify all potential scenarios of a particular activity that could produce a negative outcome. The risk assessment should prioritize those potential negative outcomes, or risks, based on an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of each of those identified risks. The risk assessment should determine the most appropriate control measures, and how the system will measure the effectiveness of those control measures.

				<paragraphs>Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories Laboratory biosafety guidance related to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) When is it appropriate to transport suspected or confirmed SARS CoV-2 specimens by pneumatic tube? it depends on the type of specimen being transported: CDC recommends that respiratory specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should not be transported through pneumatic tubes. At this time, this recommendation only applies to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 respiratory specimens. Examples of respiratory specimens include nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swabs, tracheal and lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens, and sputum. Based on currently available data, other types of specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, such as blood, urine, and feces specimens, are still acceptable to transport through pneumatic tubes. Facilities should ensure that all personnel who transport specimens via pneumatic tubes are trained in safe handling practices, specimen management, and spill decontamination procedures. Each facility should also evaluate its risks and determine the most appropriate biosafety measures and practices to implement.

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Although data are limited, they indicate that stool might not be an appropriate specimen. Stool specimens are less sensitive than respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA is often detected later during COVID-19 illness. Therefore, testing stool early in illness could potentially lead to false negative SARS-CoV-2 viral test results. Also, even though viral tests have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool (i. e., a positive test), infectious virus has only been confirmed very rarely, if at all in samples. In other words, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test does not necessarily mean a patient is currently infected and can infect others.</paragraphs>

Place specimen containers in closed and clearly labeled plastic bins until pick-up and disposal according to your institutional waste management policies. What are the biosafety recommendations for performing frozen sectioning on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patient specimens? Avoid frozen sectioning from confirmed COVID-19 patients whenever possible. Talk with the relevant clinical and surgical teams about the clinical necessity and benefit of frozen sectioning and consider appropriate alternatives for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. When frozen sectioning is unavoidable, the following are recommended, if possible: Receive specimens in an area apart from administrative staff Consider using a cryostat that has a downdraft and other safety features. Use cryostats in a closed room that has inward directional (negative) airflow vented directly to the outside or recirculated through a HEPA filter to avoid contaminating the rest of the surgical pathology suite. Provide grossing rooms with inward directional air flow. Reduce the number of operators to a minimum. Do not use freezing sprays; they are not recommended by the manufacturers of cryostat instrumentation. Collect accumulated instrument shavings and discard freezing sprays as biohazardous waste. Follow local standard decontamination procedures of the cryostat and other surfaces. Ultraviolet lights are not a substitute for terminal cleaning of the instrument.

				<paragraphs> Tensions are breaking out on beaches and tourists from Lombardy have reported instances of discrimination as Italy’s first holiday season since the coronavirus outbreak gets under way. , in Lodi province, the first town in the country’s badly affected Lombardy region to be quarantined, have claimed attempts to book holidays elsewhere in Italy were rebuffed after they revealed they would be travelling from a former “red zone”. Among they was Davide Passerini, who lives in Codogno but is mayor of the small town of Fombio, another area quarantined early. His accommodation booking for a weekend away in Tuscany was rejected after the owner discovered he was from Codogno. “Even if these are rare episodes, the prejudice leaves you feeling very bitter,” Passerini said. “It is the result of ignorance among those who don’t understand that people coming from the first red zones are today probably less likely to bring the coronavirus outbreak because the level of contagion in these places is now close to zero and has been for a long time. But in the minds of some people, Codogno remains synonymous with infectious disease. ” During a phone-in to an Italian radio show last week, a couple from another area hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak spoke about being turned away at a hotel reception with the excuse that the establishment was fully booked. At the same time, tempers are rising as people jostle for space on packed public beaches, where safety rules are rarely observed. On a beach in Ostia, near Rome, last weekend a 20-year-old woman was slapped after she asked a fellow beachgoer to move his towel because there was no safe distance between them. Marina Marzari, a psychologist from Veneto, said a 20-year-old woman recent experience at a beach in the Marche region went from “paradise to hell” within a few hours as large groups descended throughout the day. “It was the most dense crowd I’ve ever experienced,” a 20-year-old woman said. “There were no masks and not even the slightest distancing being respected. It’s really dangerous. ” Marzari called the local police several times but she said nobody came to patrol a beach in the Marche region. “We’ve all made sacrifices in recent months but feel taken for a ride after having stayed at home for so long, as when we go out situations like this aren’t made safe. If I get sick due to something similar I will press charges against the state.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” Safety rules at privately run establishments, where people can rent loungers and umbrellas, have been easier to maintain. Even though requirements are similar for free beaches – people can gather in groups of no more than four people, maintaining a 1. 5-metre distance from others, and beach games are banned – they have been more difficult to enforce. But some areas are starting to take action.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Authorities on Ischia, an island off Naples, last week imposed an exclusion law, known as a , that will ban those who flout safety regulations from a beach in the Marche region for the rest of the summer season. Enzo Ferrandino, the mayor of Ischia, told local newspapers: “The right to go to a beach in the Marche region in safety must be defended. We owe it to those who deserve a little more respect in an island that sometimes lets itself be overwhelmed by selfishness. ” In Bordighera, a beach town in Liguria, stewards have been hired to patrol public beaches, and a similar move is being planned by authorities in Salerno, Campania. The coronavirus transmission rate in Italy has slowed considerably since lockdown restrictions , despite the emergence of clusters across the country that have mostly been due to imported infections. People have been able to travel between regions since early June. But as People adapt to living alongside the virus, judgments over the risk have polarised people’s attitudes and behaviour.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>“When there is strong social anxiety, this is typical,” said Giuseppe Pantaleo, a social psychologist at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. “So we either treat everyone as a potential source of infection, which has some justification as the data is still so awful in other countries, or we go to the opposite extreme and totally deny the risk.</paragraphs>

			<data>
				<paragraphs> n the curious way things sometimes play out in the breaking news cycle, much of the instant coverage after the release of the palace letters – between the Queen, her representatives and governor general John Kerr in the run-up to the dismissal of Gough Whitlam – focused on Kerr not giving the Queens a heads-up before moving against the prime minister. That’s certainly a fact. In one of the letters, the Queen’s private secretary Sir Martin Charteris thanks Kerr for being a good chap by keeping the monarch out of the muck. “If I may say so with the greatest respect, I believe that in NOT informing what you intended to do before doing it, you acted not only with perfect constitutional propriety but also with admirable consideration for Her Majesty’s position,” the Queen’s private secretary Sir Martin Charteris says. &apos;Better for Her Majesty not to know&apos;: palace letters reveal Queen&apos;s role in sacking of Australian PM Whitlam But amplifying this particular insight misses the larger truth of what this profoundly important cache of correspondence lays bare. this profoundly important cache of correspondence’s a statement of the obvious to acknowledge two things: 1975 was a different time, another era, another country even; and the capacity for Britain to influence the affairs of Australia is a yoke this country has willingly accepted, and will go on accepting until we have the imagination and the gumption to insist that our head of state be one of our own rather than a monarch in another hemisphere. But it is incredible to read, with the hindsight of 40-plus years, with Australia having made the transition from forelock-tugging colonial outpost to respectable middle power, these minute deliberations, back and forth, between Yarralumla and the palace (an institution supposed to float airily above politics) about what should be done to resolve a political deadlock in another hemisphere created by a couple of bullheaded, egomaniacal politicians – Whitlam and It is truly bizarre, in an era of great power competition, when countries are correctly worried about incursions on their sovereignty, to be reading a collection of letters laying out what reads in a contemporary times like an act of interference in Australian democracy. It is extraordinary that a tiny unelected outpost of Britain in Australia should be deciding the fate of a democratically elected prime minister in between comparing notes about the desirability of unofficial trips to Paris and Norfolk. But that’s the story of the letters. the letters make it very clear that Kerr kept the palace very much in the loop about his thinking.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Australia’s governor general was clearly a nervous, exhaustive, effusive, backside-covering correspondent. It doesn’t matter whether Australia’s governor general gave the Queen an explicit five-second warning that Australia’s governor general was about to Base jump and sack a prime minister.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Kerr was transparent in Kerr deliberations over a long period of time, and was given comfort at various times by Charteris.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>I felt righteous anger reading this. I felt the affront to my democracy Charteris obviously counselled all the proper things. Quoting Kerr to himself, the Queen’s man said the crisis had to be “worked out in Australia”. the the Queen had no wish to intervene. the Queen noted that Fraser had a clear political motive in pushing the crisis to the brink – the Queen wanted to bring about an election the Queen was likely to win. Charteris urged caution, noting Charteris was “sure [Kerr was] right in taking the line that the crisis has not yet crossed the threshold from the political into the constitutional arena”.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Charteris also noted the power of the governor general to intervene to resolve a constitutional crisis was a “heavy responsibility” that should only be exercised “when there is demonstrably no other course”. But only a handful of days before the dismissal, Charteris did, in substance, intervene. Kerr had made it clear to Quoting Kerr that Quoting Kerr felt Quoting Kerr was on the clock in a decision-making sense, and Charteris told Kerr at a critical juncture that Quoting Kerr believed – which Quoting Kerr defined as the prerogative of the crown to dissolve parliament, or refuse to dissolve parliament – did exist. Charteris counselled caution, but Charteris did not dissuade Kerr from contemplating a dissolution as one valid course of action – there were no nods, winks, hints or warning flares to the contrary – and he praised the governor general for playing his viceregal hand with “skill and wisdom”. he then told Kerr on 5 November: “If you do, as you will, what the constitution dictates, you cannot possible [sic] do the monarchy any avoidable harm. The chances are you will do the monarchy good. ” After being dispatched from the office of prime minister without warning, Whitlam is then captured in the letters ringing the palace at 4. 15am as a “private citizen” asking to be reinstated. Seriously. Can you imagine? Whitlam dismissal: what we know so far about the palace letters and Australian PM&apos;s sacking I’m going to be honest. I felt righteous anger reading this. I felt the affront to my democracy. Whitlam predicted on the steps of the old parliament on the day of the dismissal that But this small treasure chest of letters, a primary-source account of one of the more explosive episodes in Australian political history, makes one thing abundantly clear. The governor general, the vestiges of another era, that cringing sensibility, that meek deferral to our betters, that quisling lack of national self-confidence, that passivity in the face of interference, should be done. That should be over, and this fascinating glimpse into history makes an open and shut case for why Australia needs to move on.</paragraphs>

Manchester United stay fifth as a result of Michael Obafemi’s scrambled late effort from a James Ward-Prowse corner and though  Ole Gunnar Solskjær described  Ole Gunnar Solskjær as the worst possible time to concede a goal he conceded his team had not played as well as he had hoped. Manchester United stunned by Obafemi as Southampton mix up top-four race “Manchester United never got the rhythm in Manchester United passing that Manchester United wanted,” the Manchester United manager said. “Manchester United thought Manchester United had three points in the bag but Manchester United possibly didn’t deserve to win. Manchester United played some fantastic football at times, but football is decided by key moments in games. “You are not going to be given three points at this level, you have to work for them against a good side like . Manchester United’re disappointed, but that’s how it is. I thought Manchester United defended well until a James Ward-Prowse corner. ” By that stage Manchester United were down to 10 men having used all their substitution breaks before Brandon Williams gashed his forehead in an accidental clash of heads with Kyle Walker-Peters. That was Manchester Manchester United had been unlucky earlier when neither the referee nor VAR managed to pick up a late challenge by Oriol Romeu on Mason Greenwood that many thought deserving of a red card. Though replays showed the ball had already gone and the Southampton player raked Mason Greenwood’s standing leg, a VAR check failed to detect anything out of the ordinary. “My ankle would not have liked a late challenge by Oriol Romeu on Mason Greenwood that many thought deserving of a red card, I would have been out for a month,” Solskjær said. “But Manchester United have all talked enough about VAR. Ralph Hasenhüttl said he was pleased his side had enjoyed 52% of possession at Old Trafford, but pointed out that possession alone does not win games or bring about success. “Manchester United really deserved this point, because Manchester United started very well and took the lead, and apart from allowing Manchester United back into the game with their two goals Manchester United got back into the game before half-time. “It just shows that if you stop being brave you can be hurt by players of such quality.

				<paragraphs> In the race for a Champions League berth faltered – Michael Obafemi’s late equaliser grabbing a draw for Southampton that keeps Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side in fifth. Until then United had been heading third, their highest position since opening weekend.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But with Leicester as final day opponents, a top-four finish – at least – remains in the hands of Solskjær’s team. Ole Gunnar Solskjær says United did not deserve to win United missed out on a victory after going down to 10-men due to a nasty clash of heads between Brandon Williams and Kyle Walker-Peters that forced off the former close to the final whistle. As Solskjær had used his three slots for substitutions no replacement could be sent on, so Nemanja Matic moved into defence. Chris Kavanagh, the referee, allowed for a minimum of five minutes of added time and in the sixth United conceded. James Ward-Prowse’s corner was a perfect, inswinging parabola that United could not defend and, after Jan Bednarek flicked on, Obafemi forced home, the forward having come on for Oriol Romeu. The latter might have been sent off for a first-half stamp on Mason Greenwood, yet despite VAR looking at the incident no foul was ruled, Solskjær joking afterwards that Solskjær ankle could not have withstood the challenge. Despite United now being unbeaten for 18 matches – their best run for seven years – a disappointed Harry Maguire offered honesty.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The dejection of the Manchester United players is clear after Michael Obafemi’s decisive late blow. Photograph: Matthew Peters/Manchester United/Getty Images Obafemi was understandably delighted. “I was supposed to play here in the under-18s but I missed it,” said the 20-year-old. “This is a better occasion to score. ” United were unchanged for a fifth consecutive league game for the first time in 27 years – which meant David de Gea made his 400th appearance for the club. Saints had lost only one of their five post-lockdown league outings as Ralph Hasenhüttl retained the same XI from the The opening half was topsy-turvy.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>United were sluggish, as when Ryan Bertrand lost Greenwood and fired in a low cross that David de Gea had to cut out. Here was a warning: the visitors were at Old Trafford to play and when Ward-Prowse tried to find Ryan Bertrand running behind Greenwood, only an errant pass killed the move. Now, came the opener. When David de Gea found Paul Pogba a dawdle allowed Danny Ings to pickpocket David de Gea. Nathan Redmond took over, dropped the ball on to Stuart Armstrong’s toes, and David de Gea smashed home. Paul Pogba was caught again a little later – this time by Che Adams. broke, and the Frenchman was lucky not to be punished a second time. Surely stung by this, Pogba’s next involvement was to initiate United’s equaliser. A fiercely hit cross was superbly controlled by Anthony Martial near Southampton’s penalty spot. As Jack Stephens took David de Gea down Anthony Martial slickly laid off to Rashford who scored David de Gea 21st goal of the season. United drove on quickly on for a second. Pogba – rejuvenated for the moment – found Bruno Fernandes and he recycled to Anthony Martial. What followed was supreme.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The centre-forward turned on the pace, burst inside, then hammered the ball past McCarthy. It was Bruno Fernandes 21st goal, too. The half closed with Pogba’s next involvement nasty tackle on Greenwood, Rashford just failing to find Bruno Fernandes, and Victor Lindelöf’s weak clearing header requiring Bruno Fernandes to clean up the error. Southampton were still more than keen to find an equaliser.</paragraphs>

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Southampton’s niggle-factor went up a notch when Walker-Peters handled a through ball and also saw yellow – doing so after Rashford left fly. This had become a test of whether United had the backbone to see off a side who were in their face. Perhaps this prompted Solskjær to shout: “Hey Bruno, come on,” to urge his talisman Fernandes on. Hey Bruno also withdrew Pogba for Fred in the hope of adding energy in the closing moments. If Shaw hobbling off was an unhappy sight for United, De Gea’s flying save from Redmond heartened. But, now, came the clash between Walker-Peters and Williams and Obafemi’s late, late show that has made the race for the final two Champions League places surely destined to go down to the last weekend.</paragraphs>

Southampton’s Obafemi forces the ball over the line. Photograph: Dave Thompson/AFP/Getty Images There will be five minutes of added time. I’m not sure whether that includes the stoppage for the Williams injury or not. Williams walks slowly off the field and is accompanied down the tunnel.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>United are down to 10 men and Fred has gone to left back. “Nothing says United are back more than United being outplayed at home by a 12th-placed team and the fans and MBM saying ‘great game, great game’,” says Arthur Tee. Walker-Peters is on his feet but Williams is still being treated. Walker-Peters’s sitting up and is conscious, if groggy. Williams has a gashed head and I doubt Williams’ll be able to continue. Both teams have used their three substitution blocks. A clash of heads between Williams and Walker-Peters leads to a break in play. Redmond’s cross is headed away by the stooping Matic. United are hanging on a wee bit. Southampton bring on Michael Obafemi for Oriol Romeu. Chris Kavanagh played a good advantage, allowing Redmond to zip past Matic and smack a shot across goal that was punched over the bar by the flying de Gea. It was a camera-friendly save, but a good one nonetheless. “Agree, Rob, great game,” says Simon McMahon. “And great MBM too. No stereotypes here of course, but hope all your other readers are steaming too. It is Monday night after all. ” A double change for United: Dan James and Scott McTominay replace Mason Greenwood and Bruno Fernandes. United’s revised midfield - Matic, Fred, McTominay - is a reflection of how threatening Ward-Prowse is fouled on the edge of the area by Fred.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The referee waves play on. But The referee waves’s another reminder of Southampton’s threat; The referee waves’ve been the better team in the second half. Long’s header is comfortably saved by the flying de Gea. the flying de Gea was moving away from goal so couldn’t really generate any power. “Mourinho probably requires an entirely separate blog, but what do you think happened with LVG? ” says Mark Hooper. “Off the back of the brilliant Netherlands World Cup performances, a blinding pre-season where they were racking up baseball scores if not cricket scores - and all of a sudden the flying de Gea started moaning about not having players good enough for the flying de Gea system, culminating in the night of the long knives after a cup defeat where the flying de Gea sacked half of their promising academy players …? Was the flying de Gea right? Was the flying de Gea past it? I still can’t get my head around it! ” Not a clue. I know a few United fans who loathe the flying de Gea, much more than the flying de Gea and Mourinho. I didn’t really watch much football in the flying de Gea two years at United, which makes me one of the lucky ones. Martial shoots over from the edge of the box after a terrific 60-yard run that was three parts skill, one part luck.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>I’ve just realised I’ve hardly mentioned Mason Greenwood. Mason Greenwood’s had a very quiet game, and Mason Greenwood main contribution so far has been to receive Oriol Romeu’s studs on Mason Greenwood ankle. have been impressive tonight. They look very well coached - and also, for a team with nothing much to play for, extremely motivated. Shaw limps off to be replaced by Brandon Williams. Smallbone’s dangerous low cross is put behind by Lindelof in the six-yard box. That was good defending, because Shane Long was waiting behind him to score. “Hi Rob,” says Sean Revill. “I think Martial’s debut season showed that Shane Long could be great, even playing in a late LVG team that was averse to chance creation. Then Shane Long was up &amp; down under Mourinho, likely as Shane Long never really had the manager’s backing and was made to compete with Rashford for a place. I do remember Shane Long was in incredible form in the winter of the 17/18 season under Mourinho, before Shane Long was bombed out of the team to make room for Sanchez. That worked out well, didn’t it? ” Shane Long played up front quite a lot under van Gaal as well, didn’t Shane Long?</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Shaw has twisted Shaw right ankle while putting a cross in. Shaw’s struggling here. Southampton use the drinks break to bring on Will Smallbone for Stuart Armstrong. Rashford beat Walker-Peters at the start of the move with a delicious, Neymaresque piece of skill. Neymaresque had the ball glued to Neymaresque right foot as Neymaresque dragged it to the left and then, in the same movement, knocked it through Walker-Peters’ legs.

				<paragraphs>This is a good spell for . Walker-Peters, on the right of the area, drives a fine low cross that goes through Maguire’s legs and across the six-yard box. “Right or wrong: that if Martial was being managed by a Klopp or even a Pochettino, no-one would be hesitating to cite that as the reason for Martial improvement? ” says Geoff Wignall. “It could just be that Martial now has a better manager than hitherto. ” Geoff, I’m afraid you’ve made the basic error of giving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer credit for something. The game is still very open, and so the next goal feels huge. You might even go so far as to say The game will make it 3-1 or 2-2. “Just saying no one questions De Gea’s work-rate when he welcomes in soft goals with open arms,” says Lewis Atkins. “Maybe the reason Martial wasn’t scoring like this before is that the others around him weren’t good enough. ” That’s definitely a big part of it. But so is De Gea’s change in attitude, at least in my opinion.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> ucas Ocampos was looking the other way when Sevilla scored the penalty that virtually secured their return to the Champions League on Sunday evening – and he was the one taking it. The man who had racked up 13 goals and one last-minute save, the forward who had scored one and stopped another just six days earlier – pulling on the goalie top and – was on the spot again. Bouncing the ball and beaming, if the responsibility was his the appearance belonged to a man without a care in the world.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>What happened next did, too. There were a few minutes left until half-time against Mallorca on Sunday when for the fifth time in four games in a single day – twice in Cornellá, twice at Butarque, now once at the Sánchez Pizjuán – someone sitting in a room a long way away had seen a handball.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>For the 16th time this season, more than any other team ever, Mallorca were facing a penalty. As Ocampos stood waiting to take it, the goalkeeper, Manolo Reina, came up for a chat, laughing and trying to put him off. Sergio Reguilón planted a kiss on his cheek. Éver Banega had a word. And then there was quiet, just the sound of Reina 12 yards away, shouting “Lucas! Lucas! ” Atalanta&apos;s distant dream dashed as handball rule checks Serie A charge | Ocampos ran up and when Ocampos reached the ball, turned Ocampos head and looked away. Ocampos stare fixed on the empty seats off to Ocampos right, the ball bent into the corner to Ocampos left, a touch of Magic Johnson or Michael Laudrup to it, a hint of Ronaldinho from the man who used to get up early to watch Cristiano Ronaldo. A no-look penalty that put Sevilla on course for the Champions League and Mallorca on course for the second division. A late second from Youssef En-Nesyri wrapped it up at 2-0, leaving Sevilla six points clear in fourth. “It’s not decisive, but it’s the nearest thing there is,” Diario de said. “Touching the Champions League and Mallorca,” ran the headline in El País. “We still need a point,” Sevilla’s manager, Julen Lopetegui, insisted afterwards, but it is just one. A draw at Real Sociedad on Thursday or at home against Valencia next Sunday will be enough. So would Villarreal dropping a single point in any of their final three games, starting on Monday at hometo Real Sociedad. Sevilla, who were playing their first weekend game since the return to action, are unbeaten since March and have won four in a row. There’s a solidity about their – “granite”, Julen Lopetegui called their – and there is, the midfielder Fernando admitted, “only a very small way to go”. As the midfielder Fernando celebrated, Ocampos drew a heart with the midfielder Fernando hands. There was no one in the stands where the midfielder Fernando stood; had there been, their would have sent one right back at the midfielder Fernando. Sevilla’s sporting director, Monchi, says the midfielder Fernando first fell in love with Ocampos during a Milan-Roma match in 2017.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Ocampos was on loan at Milan; Monchi had just arrived at Roma. Ocampos couldn’t afford to sign the Argentinian then but two years later, back at Sevilla, Ocampos did. At €15m, Ocampos has probably been the signing of the season. At first, Ocampos admits, Ocampos found it hard to adapt: it was faster than anything Ocampos had experienced before. And nor, as it turned out, has Ocampos ended up playing where Ocampos thought Ocampos would – moving from left to right. But Ocampos has been superb, on Sunday offering up a portrait of Ocampos.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Aggressive, direct, relentless – Ocampos is the one drawing saves, carrying attacks, bombing into the box, scoring goals.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Against Eibar last Monday he scored the only goal – then, called upon as an emergency goalkeeper, Against Eibar also saved a shot from the Eibar keeper Marko Dmitrovic, up for a corner in the last minute. Julen Lopetegui acknowledged that Sevilla need one more point, or for Villarreal to drop points, to secure a top-four place. Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images “There was a goal, a save, a win, and suffering,” he said afterwards, the smile bigger than the face on which it sat. Grappling with the gloves, heart racing, the referee telling he to calm down and take he time, Ocampos had been nervous then, he admitted. This time he wasn’t. Once he penalty was in, Sevilla were on their way. Alongside Jesús Navas, Ocampos’s right wing has made more chances than any other wing in Spain, and he has more than twice as many goals as any of he teammates. Not that he is alone. Sevilla have struggled in the striking positions this season, new signings leaving again having been unable to make a mark. Munas Dabbur came for €15m and left six months later, having played just twice in the league. Javier Hernández joined for €8m and departed having played nine league games, scoring only once. Luuk de Jong cost €12m and is the team’s second highest scorer on six; cursed with bad luck, it can seem like he is the best scorer of nearly goals in Spain. The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. Ocampos has stepped into that void and, besides, elsewhere on the pitch it has worked, the structure suiting him even if it doesn’t always help the strikers. If Ocampos is not the signing of the season, that might be because one of Ocampos teammates is. Jules Koundé, €20m from Bordeaux, say. Or Fernando, the €4m signing from Galatasaray.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Maybe Diego Carlos, who came from Nantes for €10m. In short Monchi, who built Sevilla over 17 years, departed leaving Maybe Diego Carlos, who came from Nantes for €10m , and then came back after less than two years, and has only gone and done it again.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Sevilla are back being the club that make a virtue of selling Maybe Diego Carlos, who came from Nantes for €10m best players and starting again, somehow finding footballers in the strangest places. Monchi likes to tell the story of how Diego Maradona came into training one morning and commented on how smart Monchi’s watch was. “Oh, that? That’s a fake,” he replied. The next day, Diego Maradona turned up and gave he a real Rolex, saying that no friend of he was going to wear a fake.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And yet making a success of cheap alternatives, to the extent where it is hard to tell the difference, is pretty much what he does. In the summer Sevilla sold Pablo Sarabia and Wissam Ben Yedder; they scored 53 goals between them last season, a huge hole to fill. they also allowed Sevilla to begin again. Fifteen players departed, 13 arrived. Suso and En-Nesyri arrived six months later. Suso and En-Nesyri spent €149m, according to Marca; Banega has been superb of late, all the more so after he announced his departure for Saudi Arabia at the end of the season – and what a pity that is – as has Navas, still faster than anyone else all these years later. Of the 16 players that played on Sunday, 13 are in their first season at Sevilla. None of the signings came as a guarantee either. Ocampos scored four last season. Nantes, Galatasaray, Bordeaux and Eibar are not really the places you get superstars from. Even for Monchi, this was a step again: this wasn’t one or two risks, a couple of unknowns, it was an entire team of Nantes, Galatasaray, Bordeaux and Eibar. Making that work is not easy. Which is where Lopetegui comes in, a new manager for a whole new team, trying to build something from scratch; like a contestant on The Krypton Factor, Banega had countless pieces to fix together and not much time to do it in. The son of a champion stone lifter from the Basque country, there were doubts too, at least to begin with. by the experience of Spain and Madrid , the truth is there wasn’t much initial enthusiasm, still less warmth, for a man who Monchi said “needs to triumph”. But, driven perhaps by that sense of redemption, mission, The early signs were good. Sevilla’s meeting with Real Sociedad might even have been , they briefly went top and they beat Betis, which is When the penalty went in, there was no smile, no big celebration, no embrace and certainly no wild celebrating, but Sevilla’s manager knew how big this was. As it all unfolded, Sevilla’s manager sat silently in the shadows on the bench, hands over Sevilla’s manager eyes, hoping. Julen Lopetegui did not want to look. Nor, it turned out, did Ocampos.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Pep Guardiola will be handed about £150m to bolster his Manchester City squad after the The court of arbitration for sport ruled on Monday that Uefa’s decision should be overturned and a €30m (£27m) fine reduced to €10m. Manchester City Champions League ban lifted by Cas but club fined €10m This means  Pep Guardiola will be allowed to invest heavily, particularly in a rearguard that proved the achilles heel in Uefa’s failed title defence this season. Pep Guardiola is prioritising a centre-back and left-back and may move for a striker because of Uefa’s potential departure next summer when the club record goalscorer’s contract is due to end. Bayern Munich’s David Alaba, who can play in both those defensive positions, is The prospect of  Pep Guardiola being successful in the market is further boosted by the fine reduction, with £18m approximately equivalent to an elite player’s salary. Pep Guardiola has previously stated that whatever Cas decided  Pep Guardiola would see out a contract that runs until summer 2021. Whether  Pep Guardiola will to extend  Pep Guardiola tenure beyond a fifth year is unclear, although this will give Manchester City greater hope. Does the court of arbitration for sport decision conclude Uefa’s financial fair play trials? Very likely, yes. In principle Uefa haves a right to contest findings on legal points in a Swiss court, but European football’s governing body has given no indication that it intends to. So Manchester City, although found by Cas to have not cooperated and to have obstructed the investigations of Uefa’s club financial control body, have succeeded in having the Champions League ban overturned, apparently by presenting a fuller case to Cas.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>An ordeal that began with allegations based on “leaks” published by Der Spiegel in November 2018 appears to be over, with no worse sanction for Uefa’s club than a €10m fine for the obstruction of the Uefa investigations. What were the key findings of the Cas decision? The full ruling is not yet available, but Cas has issued a one-page press release of its findings. On the central serious finding by the AC, that City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, had subsidised sponsorships from Abu Dhabi companies, Cas found the charges were “either not established or time-barred. ” According to the CFCB procedural rules, a prosecution must be brought within five years of alleged breaches. Clearly the AC believed a prosecution was brought within that time, but the Cas panel of three lawyers decided a prosecution was not. the Cas panel of threCasawyers said the charges allegations were “clearly more significant” than obstructing the CFCB investigations, so lifted the Champions League ban but imposed the €10m fine. After the the AC found the charges proven in February, City attacked Uefa and both chambers of CFCB as biased, saying in a statement the case was “initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa”. Days later the club’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, was more conciliatory, saying Uefa is much bigger than this FFP chamber” and praising Uefa as “an association of associations”, which has “many people that work … very hard for the benefit of Uefa, but also for the benefit of the clubs of Uefa like ours”.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>This time, the club’s issued a short statement, “welcoming the implications of today’s ruling as a validation of the Club’s position” and thanking the Cas panel members “for their diligence and the due process that they administered”. today’s ruling appears to clarify Kevin De Bruyne’s future, with the Belgian looking set to stay at least until his terms end in 2023. The 29-year-old had said his if the ban was upheld. A team whose core also includes Ederson, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva, Aymeric Laporte, Agüero, Gabriel Jesus and Rodrigo also appears less likely to be broken up. The quashing of the ban could prove a fillip for the remainder of the season. City, who have secured second place in the , face Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday and resume in the Champions League on 7 August.

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Two early goals from Ferland Mendy and Karim Benzema had been enough – just – to take them to a ninth consecutive win, beating Granada 2-1, and within one win of winning the title with two games still to go. The longest league will be Two early goals from Ferland Mendy and Karim Benzema, secured when it became the shortest: an intense summer tournament in which Two early goals from Ferland Mendy and Karim Benzema never even trailed, let alone lost. When the football restarted after almost a hundred days of lockdown, Madrid were second, a club that had won only two of the last 11 titles on course to miss out on another. But The longest league has been good for them. The longest league, meant a tangible target laid before eleven-game, something to reach out and take. Zinedine Zidane’s team arrived here having won eight from eight and kept five consecutive clean sheets, leading Barcelona on the head to head record with a game in hand. Zinedine Zidane’s team hadn’t even trailed yet. And didn’t here either. Don&apos;t look now: Ocampos hits the spot to almost seal Sevilla&apos;s dream finish | Sid Lowe In these five weeks, Madrid have not always been sparkling but it felt like somehow, someone would find a way through. Few expected it to be the man who did, not this time. Twenty different members of Madrid’s squad had scored in The longest league. Ferland Mendy, to offer the defensive stability Marcelo could not, was not one of Twenty different members of Madrid’s squad. Marcelo is now.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>There was ease in the way in which Marcelo ran past Víctor Díaz to the left side of the area and ferocity in the way Marcelo hit the shot, the ball flying high into the net at the near post. They had only been playing nine minutes. They only needed half of that to get another, and this time there was a more familiar look to it. A break that began with Darwin Machís turning into trouble on the corner of one area ended at Benzema’s feet in the opposite corner of the other.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Same place Ferland Mendy had been, same conclusion, different means. Cutting back, Benzema bent the ball beyond Rui Silva for his 19th league goal. On the touchline Granada manager, Diego Martínez, swore loudly; to Benzema left, Benzema clapped. It was done, Benzema must have felt and Benzema wouldn’t have been alone. Madrid played, the ball theirs, moved with a smoothness that belied their speed. It even sounded good. Tac, tac, it went, from one side to the other, through the lines and back again, round and round. Occasionally there was a shout. Carva, go. Case, Case. Tac, tac. Bats and swallows dived over the stadium, a high-pitched serenade to accompany the percussive rhythm.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Tac, tac. Luka, wait. Tac, tac. Open, open. Tac, tac.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The ease with which Benzema finds space, drifting free, was something to see; the ease Modric found him was too, a gorgeously gentle, angled pass providing the Frenchman with another opportunity. This time it was a thump, Rui Silva pushing over just before half-time. But by then Granada, who had lost their way, left chasing butterflies, had found This time again. Domingos Duarte drew a sharp save from Thibaut Courtois – a reminder of the goalkeeper’s huge contribution to this incoming title and that there might still be life in this game. Early in the second half, there really was. Casmeiro was caught in the centre and Yangel Herrera led the charge, slipping the ball into Machís. From virtually the same place that the first two goals had been scored, Casmeiro drove it between Courtois’s legs and the place erupted as much as any place with barely two hundred people in it can. Manchester United stunned by Obafemi as Southampton mix up top-four race This was different now, Machís guiding a half volley past the post then almost reaching Carlos Fernández’s filtered pass. It sounded different too: louder, more tense, protests accompanying the play where before there were none, even the ball hit harder now, less no room for subtlety. Domingos Duarte carried from deep all the way to the edge of the Madrid area where Domingos Duarte was brought down. When the scene was repeated not long after, Ángel Montoro complained to the ref: “you could hear the bloody clash”. Domingos Duarte was right too. the pace quickened, the pitch tilted towards Madrid’s goal. There was a scramble in the six-yard box, Germán falling in the crowd. Still Granada came. Antonio Antonín controlled on his chest and hit an acrobatic volley that Courtois saved, diving full length. The ball came back in and reached Ramon Azeez, whose shot was cleared off the line by Ramos. “Bravo! Bravo! ” Martínez shouted, applause intensifying as it echoed round, everything accelerating.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Ángel Montoro’s late header drifted over and then Rui Silva went up for a corner, only to watch it fly over his head. Madrid hung on, not least because they had something to hang on to - a league title that they surely won’t let go of now.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> f you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. If there was ever any doubt that Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed was playing this game to win, such thoughts will have been erased for good by the success of Manchester City’s stunning, potentially against the judicial processes of European football. This being football, the success of City’s supremely powerful legal team in junking a flawed two-year ban will no doubt be cast in the most binary terms. Pep Guardiola clear for £150m transfer spend after Manchester City ban lifted For the most partisan areas of the club’s support, and indeed for some of the surrounding media, the judicial panel’s decision will be seen as “a sensational victory” in the classic football style: cause for dancing in the streets, beer thrown in the air, taunting memes, perhaps even a kind of heartwarming underdog story. Who knows, perhaps it really is testimony to the beauty of sport that previously unknown boundlessly wealthy billionaires can stand up to rules framed to protect the interests of more established boundlessly wealthy billionaires. Either way the scoreline looks decisive. New Money 1 Old Money 0 (aet). At the other extreme there will be a temptation to see City’s victory as another strand in a wider global truth. Plate sin with gold and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks. Or in other words, if you don’t like the justice you receive, please ask your sales adviser as there are other, more expensive versions available. was put in place to control the richest players at European football’s table. But the richest players at European football’s table can also afford the best lawyers. Certainly, the richest players at European football’s table can afford better lawyers than those at Uefa’s disposal, judging by an oddly brittle case reliant on time-barred complaints. A two-year ban seemed punitive at the time. No ban at all, despite having obstructed Uefa’s process, seems lenient, but is perhaps a reaction to the former. Does the court of arbitration for sport decision conclude City’s financial fair play trials? Very likely, yes. In principle Uefa haves a right to contest findings on legal points in a Swiss court, but European football’s governing body has given no indication that it intends to.

As ever, the truth is more nuanced than either of those polarities. There are probably two things worth saying right now. First, Guardiola is not in any sense a victory for the little man. the little man was never involved in this battle in the first place. No doubt they will be dancing in the streets of global billionaire overclass this evening, but this would also have been the case had the decision gone in Uefa’s favour. This argument has always been about the divvying up of wealth and privilege among the already wealthy and privileged. By way of example, one likely upshot of City losing the case would have been Manchester United taking their place in the Champions League next season. Which of these outcomes makes the most sporting sense?</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Which feels most like evidence of life-affirming social mobility? Which model of hyper-capitalism – state-backed, or leveraged buyout – do you prefer? Pep Guardiola never mentioned he would leave City if the ban was upheld but there is no doubt it would have been a major blight on his tenure. Photograph: Manu Fernández/AP It is worth remembering this in any debate about fairness. There are no Ewoks here. Everyone is Darth Vader. And money – either the money you like, or the money you don’t like – is always winning this game. This is not to say City’s victory will leave European football unchanged. The FFP rules were always a strange construct, born out of the sensible idea of restricting unsustainable debt, but also shot through with a grandiose pseudo-socialism cooked up during Michel Platini’s time at Uefa. Michel Platini talked about wanting to “protect football from business”, and argued that cultural protectionism was justified, that the unfettered free market was not applicable to football. City decision does not mean end of Financial Fair Play | David Conn In the years since the debt burden has been stabilised. But The FFP rules have also protected this notion of ancestral privilege. In 11 seasons of FFP football the Champions League has still been dominated by the same top 10 wealthiest clubs from the year it first came in to play, clubs that have become ever more untouchable each year. Barcelona, member-owned but with a historic dual-stranglehold on Spanish football, are deemed good. The arriviste overspending of a jobbing billionaire is bad. But how is anyone to break into this world? And what kind of appalling mismanagement would it take to actually fall out of it (ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you to: Arsenal)? All of which brings us on, finally, to football and to the immediate future of a City squad whose basic existence had been cast as a crime against sport, but which is now free to continue its pursuit of a more familiar kind of glory. There was no public indication Pep Guardiola might have left had the ban been upheld. Those in the know seemed to suggest Pep Guardiola was staying in any case.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But Pep Guardiola can now see out Pep Guardiola contract with the added boost of two shots in 10 months at the competition Pep Guardiola covets most. The talk of late-20s star players agitating for a move is also dead in the water. This team have a free run from here, invigorated by a galvanising sense of righteousness, and with players fit and in form. Signings will be required: a high‑class centre-half, perhaps a better heir to Fernandinho, perhaps even another centre‑forward. But who would bet against This team storming This team way through Uefa’s mini club Euros in Portugal next month, or indeed against the narrative gold of a meeting in the final with a strong and settled Paris Saint-Germain? As a season-ending Uefa showpiece it is hard to imagine a better reminder that this has always been about money versus money: new, old, or even newer. Or indeed that the greatest failure of FFP in the last few years isn’t City’s case, but the absurdity of PSG spending £1bn on transfers, successfully skewing their own domestic league in perpetuity, and still escaping any real restraint. In the wake of such cases there is a view the greatest legacy of FFP will be to undermine Uefa’s own notions of centralised control, ushering ever closer some kind of private equity breakaway league. This is still some way off. But Uefa’s authority, not to mention its basic sense of competence, is seriously undermined. And let’s face it, fair play was never really a part of this argument in the first place.</paragraphs>

National percentages of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by type of laboratory: Two surveillance indicators are being used to track outpatient or emergency department (ED) visits for illness with symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Nationally, levels of ILI activity remain below baseline for the twelfth week and in all 10 surveillance regions for the past ten to thirteen weeks. However, most regions reported increases in percentage of visits for ILI, which is atypical for this time of year, and some parts of the country are seeing activity levels higher than levels seen in March and April. CLI also increased this past week. Recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing, are likely affecting data reported from both networks, making it difficult to draw conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give additional insight into illness related to COVID-19. Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates since March 1, 2020, are updated weekly. The overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 107. 2 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (316. 9 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (161. 7 per 100,000). Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 6. 9% during week 26 to 5. 5% during week 27, representing the eleventh week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is currently below the epidemic threshold but will likely change as more death certificates are processed, particularly for recent weeks.

The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 107. 2 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people 65 years of age and older (316. 9 per 100,000) followed by people 50-64 years (161. 7 per 100,000). Hospitalization rates are cumulative and will increase as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5. 7 times that of non-Hispanic White persons, non-Hispanic Black persons have a rate approximately 4. 7 times that of non-Hispanic White persons, and Hispanic or Latino persons have a rate approximately 4. 6 times that of non-Hispanic White persons. Cumulative hospitalization rates for COVID-19 in adults (18-64 years) at this time are higher than cumulative end-of-season hospitalization rates for influenza over each of the past 5 influenza seasons. For people 65 years and older, current cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates at this time are higher than cumulative end-of season hospitalization rates for influenza for 4 of the 5 past influenza seasons; lower only than rates observed during the 2017-18 season. For children (0-17 years), cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are much lower than cumulative influenza hospitalization rates at comparable time points* during recent influenza seasons. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 6. 9% during week 26 to 5. 5% during week 27, representing the eleventh consecutive week during which a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC has been recorded.</paragraphs>

The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are performing primary diagnostic functions; therefore, the percentage of specimens testing positive across laboratory types can be used to monitor overall trends in COVID-19 activity. As the outbreak progresses, it is possible that different types of laboratories will take on different roles, and the data interpretation may need to change. Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC* * Commercial and clinical laboratory data represent select laboratories and do not capture all tests performed in the United States. * Commercial laboratories began testing for SARS-CoV-2 in early March, but the number and geographic distribution of reporting commercial laboratories became stable enough to calculate a weekly percentage of specimens testing positive as of March 29, 2020. Two syndromic surveillance systems are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors a slightly different syndrome, and together Two syndromic surveillance systems provide a more comprehensive picture of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness than either would individually. Two syndromic surveillance systems are currently being affected by recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so.

Mild COVID-19 illness presents with symptoms similar to ILI, so ILINet is being used to track trends of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and allows for comparison with prior influenza seasons. Nationwide during week 27, 1. 2% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is well below the national baseline of 2. 4% but is increasing, which is atypical for this time of year compared to previous influenza seasons. The pattern of increasing percentage of visits for ILI was reported for all age groups. Nationally, laboratory-confirmed influenza activity as reported by clinical laboratories is at levels usually seen during summer months which, along with changes in healthcare seeking behavior and the impact of social distancing, is likely contributing to the low level of ILI activity. * Age-group specific percentages should not be compared to the national baseline. , the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0.</paragraphs>

Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as we move into summer weeks when lower levels of influenza and other respiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While all regions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlighted here. Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and New York City. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared to the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at or above the mean. The number of jurisdictions at each activity level during week 26 and the change compared to the previous week are summarized in the table below and shown in the following maps. *Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state and may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state. Differences in Data collected in ILINet presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the whole state likely being the more complete. NSSP is a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments and academic and private sector partners to collect, analyze and share electronic patient encounter data received from multiple healthcare settings. To track trends of potential COVID-19 visits, visits for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) (fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code) and ILI to a subset of emergency departments in 47 states are being monitored. Nationwide during week 27, 3. 2% of emergency department visits captured in NSSP were due to CLI and 1. 0% were due to ILI. This is the third week of an increasing percentage of visits for CLI and ILI nationally since activity peaked in early April. Compared to week 26, 5 of (Regions 4 [South East], 6 [South Central], 7 [Central], 9 [South West/Coast] and 10 [Pacific Northwest]) reported increases in the percentages of visits for both CLI and ILI during week 27.

A total of 34,791 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were reported by sites between March 1, 2020 and July 4, 2020. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 107. 2 per 100,000 population. Among the 0-4 years, 5-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years, and ≥ 65 years age groups, the highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged ≥ 65, followed by adults aged 50-64 years and adults aged 18-49 years. Among the 34,791 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalized cases, 32,766 (94. 2%) had information on race and ethnicity while collection of race and ethnicity was still pending for 2,025 (5. 8%) cases. When examining overall age-adjusted rates by race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5. 8 times that of non-Hispanic White persons, non-Hispanic Black persons have a rate approximately 4. 7 times that of non-Hispanic White persons, and Hispanic or Latino persons have a rate approximately 4. 6 times that of non-Hispanic White persons.

				<paragraphs>Additional data on by age and race and ethnicity — COVID-NET, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates by race/ethnicity are calculated using hospitalized COVID-NET cases with known race and ethnicity for the numerator and For each age category, rate ratios are the ratios between crude hospitalization rates within each racial/ethnic group and the crude hospitalization rate among non-Hispanic white persons in the same age category. Overall rates are adjusted to account for differences in age distributions within race/ethnicity strata in the COVID-NET catchment area; the age strata used for the adjustment include 0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ years. Non-Hispanic White persons and non-Hispanic Black persons represent the highest proportions of hospitalized cases reported to COVID-NET, followed by Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons. However, some racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented among hospitalized cases as compared with the overall population of the catchment area. Prevalence ratios show a similar pattern to that of the age-adjusted hospitalization rates: non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have the highest prevalence ratio, followed by non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic or Latino persons. Persons of multiple races (0. 2%) or unknown race and ethnicity (5. 8%) are not represented in the table but are included as part of the denominator. Prevalence ratio is calculated as the ratio of the proportion of hospitalized COVID-NET cases over the proportion of population in COVID-NET catchment area. Among 9,130 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 90. 9% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were hypertension, obesity, chronic metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disease. Among 186 hospitalized children with information on underlying conditions, 51. 6% had at least one reported underlying medical condition.

				<paragraphs> looks certain to intensify Poland’s standoff with Brussels, as the conservative’s allies in the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party pursue changes to the judiciary, media and other areas that the European commission says subvert democratic norms. Duda squeezed past his Europhile rival, the liberal Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, to win re-election by 51. 2% to 48. 8%, official results showed on Monday, after a bitter campaign laced with homophobic language and accusations that Trzaskowski would sell out Polish families to “Jewish demands”. Trzaskowski’s team have said they are looking into election irregularities, and the result could still be challenged at Poland’s supreme court. Experts have also said the narrowness of Poland’s victory means PiS may face a more confident opposition. Most observers, however, see the incumbent’s win as giving the conservative-nationalist government clear continued control over Poland key institutions, allowing Poland to further erode judicial independence and democratic norms, and clearing the path for further clashes in Poland battles with the EU. Since coming to power in 2015, Law and Justice has argued that far-reaching changes to the judiciary are necessary to remove communist-era judges. Piotr Buras and Pawel Zerka of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) said Duda’s win “does not simply mean the maintenance of the status quo: it will lead to further deterioration of the rule of law in Poland”. The result - which leaves Duda in office, and able to veto legislation put forward by an eventual opposition government after parliamentary elections in 2023 – “paves the way for a complete state capture by Law and Justice, letting it dismantle Poland’s already damaged system of checks and balances in a similar way that has already happened in Hungary”, the analysts said. Observers now expect the ruling party to push ahead with its efforts to bring the Polish courts under tighter political control and, having already turned Poland’s state-owned television into its mouthpiece, step up efforts to tame the private media. The justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro confirmed late on Sunday that the ruling party could push on quickly with the ruling party conservative agenda and push for change in private media ownership towards outlets more favourable to PiS. Issues of culture dominated the campaign, with Duda campaigning on traditional “family values” and PiS denouncing LGBT rights as a foreign import that threatened Polish identity. Duda pledged to tighten already highly restrictive laws against abortion, campaigned against what Duda called “LGBT ideology”, likening it to a new form of communist brainwashing, and vowed to create “gay-free zones”. Tapping into old antisemitic tropes, Duda’s campaign and the pro-government state media also repeatedly cast Trzaskowski as working on behalf of a “powerful foreign lobby” linked to George Soros and the Bilderberg group, International observers from the OSCE said after the election’s first round that the campaign had been marked by “inflammatory language by the incumbent and his campaign that was at times xenophobic and homophobic”, adding: “In the run-up to the election’s, the public broadcaster became [his] campaign tool, while some reporting had clear xenophobic and antisemitic undertones. ” Poland was once one of the most pro-EU of the bloc’s ex-communist eastern states, but critics say the commission and member states have failed to do enough to prevent a more recent slide in the rule of law, despite initiating a sanctions process known as Article 7 against both and Hungary that could in theory lead to the suspension of their voting rights in the European council. A bitter row broke out last month after it emerged that Poland, one of the EU nations least affected by the coronavirus crisis, was set to become one of the biggest recipients of the bloc’s pandemic recovery fund despite ’s government’s attacks on the judiciary and LGBT community. Several governments reportedly lobbied the European council president, Charles Michel, to rethink the distribution of EU money and toughen EU conditions, with some calling for EU funding to be denied to municipalities that declared themselves LGBT free.</paragraphs>

Despite member states criticism of EU, however, neither Duda nor PiS is likely to call for Poland to leave the bloc: a majority of Poles remain in favour of the EU, which in 2018 allocated more than €16. 3bn to Poland in structural and development funds – the equivalent of 3. 4% of the Polish economy.</paragraphs>

For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors. ”  Examples include CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations. CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners. People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection. It is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you: Take precautions as you go about your Better understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19. Anticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick. Reduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors. How We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. that have been identified to date include: Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person’s risk. CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below. These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. For surveillance of COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems in collaboration with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to monitor COVID-19 in the United States. COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources using existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, lab reporting, the healthcare safety system, ongoing research platforms, and other new surveillance systems designed to answer specific questions. The data from these systems, combined, create an updated picture of COVID-19’s spread and its effects in the United States and are used to inform the U. S. national public health response to COVID-19. To understand disease severity and the spectrum of illness due to COVID-19 To understand risk factors for severe disease and transmission of COVID-19 To monitor for changes in the virus that causes COVID-19 To estimate disease burden due to COVID-19 To understand how COVID-19 impacts the capacity of the U. S. healthcare system (for example, availability and shortages of key resources) COVID-19 data can be used to help public health professionals, policy makers, and health care providers monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and support better understanding of illness, disease severity, effectiveness of community interventions, and social disruptions associated with COVID-19 in the U. S.. These data help inform U. S. national, state, local, tribal, and territorial public health responses to COVID-19. Detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts. Where can I find information on COVID-19 cases, testing, hospitalizations, deaths, and other surveillance in the United States?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>CDC provides this information on the Cases reported in the U. S. so far (and new cases reported in the past day) Deaths reported in the U. S. so far (and new deaths reported in the past day) Reported deaths by county in the U. S. so far (and new deaths reported in the past day) U. S. Virologic Surveillance (national percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at public health, clinical, and commercial laboratories) Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates and patient characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions) National percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 U. S. COVID-19 cases and deaths by state/territory (counts, rates, and deaths by age group and sex) Information on large-scale geographic, community-level, and special populations seroprevalence surveys (Results from these surveys will be posted as they become available. ) COVID-19 Data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Data on mental health and access to healthcare from the NCHS partnership with the U. S. Census Bureau on the Household Pulse Survey (includes indicators of anxiety and depression based on reported frequency of symptoms during the last 7 days) Number of tests (viral and antibody) conducted and positive tests reported in the U. S. Estimated percentage of inpatient beds occupied by all patients, by state Estimated percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, by state Estimated percentage of ICU beds occupied by all patients, by state . This change was made to reflect an interim statement issued by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19; with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19. Why are we seeing a rise in cases? The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases reflects the rapid community spread of COVID-19 in many U. S. states, territories and means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Also, the being reported in the United States is rising due to Why are the death counts for the Cases in the U. S. webpage different from the Provisional Death Counts for COVID-19 webpage? The COVID-19 death count shown on the web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments. The COVID-19 death count shown on the web page reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting from health departments. from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday through Friday with information collected from death certificates. information collected from death certificates represent the most accurate death counts. However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, there is on average a delay of 1–2 weeks before they are reported. Therefore, the Provisional Death Counts may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods. Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received. Provisional COVID-19 death counts may therefore differ from those on other published sources, such as media reports or the What does the mortality rate mean? Why does this percentage keep changing? the mortality rate is the percentage of people who died due to COVID-19 out of the total number of people with COVID-19 reported. Since this is an ongoing outbreak, the percentage can change daily. There are several reasons for this, such as there may be delays in reporting of additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and not all COVID-19 cases will be detected. Why do some case numbers reported by state health departments, Johns Hopkins, and the World Health Organization (WHO) sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ. Case numbers reported on other websites may differ from what is posted on CDC’s website because CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with each jurisdiction. Differences between reporting jurisdictions and CDC’s website may occur due to the timing of reporting and website updates. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by other sites may differ. Does CDC create surveillance reports on COVID-19? Yes. CDC is modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19. On April 3, CDC posted the first of what will be a weekly surveillance report called COVID-19 surveillance data are also used to produce publications, including CDC’s to protect people from COVID-19 in a variety of settings. What is CDC COVID Data Tracker? is a website that allows users to interact with a variety of data on COVID-19 that is updated daily. a website that allows users to interact with a variety of data on COVID-19 that is updated daily builds on other agency efforts – such as CDC’s new weekly COVID-19 surveillance report, – to capture the impact the virus is having on the United States. CDC COVID Data Tracker presents data using visual dashboards that include interactive maps and graphs. CDC COVID Data Tracker is being developed in phases. The first phase showcases data on U. S. COVID-19 cases and deaths as well as the social impacts of COVID-19. How often is CDC COVID Data Tracker updated? CDC COVID Data Tracker is updated daily. Specifics of data reporting are described as a footnote on each page. What kinds of data does CDC COVID Data Tracker track and how are data on U. S. COVID-19 cases and deaths as well as the social impacts of COVID-19 displayed?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>CDC COVID Data Tracker users can track the following data daily: Trends in U. S. COVID-19 cases by jurisdiction, including case information over time and by age group and sex. Laboratory tests performed by U. S. COVID-19 commercial, hospital, public health, and CDC laboratories and the percentage of positive test results. School closures in the United States due to COVID-19, including information on planned dates of reopening, the percentage of school districts to remain closed over time, and projections for how long schools may remain closed (7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 1 month) Impact of COVID-19 events, which includes news reports related to social impact events resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, such as school closures, localized outbreaks, and state of emergency declarations.

				<paragraphs> What CDC is Doing for Cruise Travelers Travelers Prohibited from Entry to the US This page is about travel that is different from your everyday activities, away from your local community. For advice on how to safely meet basic household needs within your local community, see CDC’s webpage about COVID-19 cases and deaths have been reported in all 50 states, and the situation is constantly changing. Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick. If you are thinking about traveling away from your local community, ask: Will you or those you are traveling with be within 6 feet of others during or after your trip? Being within 6 feet of others increases your chances of getting infected and infecting others Are you or those you are traveling with more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 Do you live with someone who is more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 If you get infected while traveling you can spread COVID-19 to loved ones when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms Does the state or local government where you live or at your destination require you to stay home for 14 days after traveling? Some state and local governments may require people who have recently traveled to stay home for 14 days If you get sick with COVID-19, will you have to miss work or school? People with COVID-19 disease need to stay home until they are Do not travel if you are sick , or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days.

Keep 6 feet of physical distance from others. Wear a cloth face covering in public Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. We don’t know if one type of travel is safer than others; however, airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to (keep 6 feet apart from other people). Consider the following risks for getting or spreading COVID-19, depending on how you travel: Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others. Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and surfaces. You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel typically means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others.</paragraphs>

Take steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 when booking accommodations or planning an overnight stay If you are considering cleaning your travel lodgings, see CDC’s guidance on how to where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination. While you are traveling, it is possible a state or local government may put into place travel restrictions, such as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, mandated quarantines upon arrival, or even state border closures. Plan to keep checking for updates as you travel. Is it safe to travel to visit family or friends? Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Before you travel, learn if in your local area or in any of the places you are going. Traveling to visit family may be especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 . People at higher risk for severe illness need to take Is it safe to travel to campgrounds/go camping? Going camping at a time when much of the United States is experiencing community spread of COVID-19 can pose a risk to you if you come in close contact with others or share public facilities (like restrooms or picnic areas) at campsites or along the trails. Exposure may be especially unsafe if you are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 and are planning to be in remote areas, without easy access to medical care.

				<paragraphs> What actions should I take to plan for an outbreak? Creating an emergency plan for mass gatherings and large community events, such as concerts and sporting events, can help protect the health of your staff, attendees, and the local community. This planning should include: Encouraging staff and attendees to stay home if sick. Developing flexible refund policies for attendees. Providing supplies for attendees and staff that can be used to help prevent the spread of germs. Consulting local public health officials about your event. How many guests can safely attend a conference, sporting event, concert, or other community event? CDC does not have a limit or recommend a specific number of attendees for these types of events and instead encourages event organizers to focus on ways to limit people’s contact with each other. Each event organizer will need to determine the appropriate number for their setting in collaboration with local health officials. Each event organizer should also check state, county, and city rules regarding any current restrictions limiting the number of attendees at events. In general, the number that is chosen should allow individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other. Rather than focusing on an ideal number, event organizers and administrators should focus on the ability to reduce and limit contact between attendees, staff, and others. In general, the , the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor spaces because indoors, it can be harder to keep people at least 6 feet apart and the ventilation is not as good as it is outdoors. Does CDC have recommendations on how to maintain 6 feet between attendees during events? Limit attendance or seating capacity to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms. Block off rows or sections of seating in order to space people at least 6 feet apart. Use multiple entrances and exits and discourage crowded waiting areas. Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (such as guides for creating one-way routes). Prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained as much as possible.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Offer online attendance options in addition to in-person attendance to help reduce the number of attendees. Consider limiting the number of people who occupy the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. Do not allow lines or crowds to form near the restroom. Take steps to ensure that individuals can stay at least 6 feet apart from each other. Should organizers test all attendees and staff for COVID-19 before they can enter an event? recommend testing all attendees and staff before allowing organizers to enter.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Testing all event attendees and staff for COVID-19 before allowing organizers to enter the venue has not been systematically studied. It is unknown if entry testing at event venues provides any additional reduction in person-to-person transmission of the virus beyond what would be expected with other preventive measures (such as social distancing, wearing cloth face coverings, hand washing, enhanced cleaning and disinfection). CDC does recommend conducting health checks such as temperature screening and/or symptom checking of staff and attendees safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Does CDC recommend all event attendees wear cloth face coverings? Yes.

Using a cloth face covering in public, especially when it may be difficult to maintain a distance of at least six feet from other people. How should staff clean the facility before and during the event to limit spread of the virus?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Event staff should use several strategies to maintain healthy environments, including Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces within the venue at least daily or between uses as much as possible—for example, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, grab bars, hand railings, and cash registers. Clean and disinfect shared objects between uses—for example, payment terminals, tables, countertops, bars, and condiment holders. Consider closing areas such as drinking fountains that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected during an event. Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection. Plan for and enact these cleaning routines when renting event space and ensure that other groups who may use your facilities follow these routines. to avoid harm to employees and other individuals. Always read and follow label instructions for each product, and store products securely away from children. . Cleaning products should not be used near children. Staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using Cleaning products to prevent attendees or Cleaning products from inhaling toxic vapors.

However, do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk to customers or employees (e. g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms).</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>What are things to consider when determining if an event needs to be postponed or canceled? Consult with local public health officials and continually assess, based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees (if possible) at an event or gathering. When determining if you should postpone or cancel a large gathering or event, consider the: Overall number of attendees or crowd size. Number of attendees who are at higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19. This includes older adults and people with underlying health problems such as lung or heart disease and diabetes. How close together attendees will be at an event. Amount of spread in local community and the communities from where your attendees are likely to travel. Needs and capacity of the local community to host or participate in an event. Is there information I can share with staff and attendees about COVID-19? Share these resources to help people understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to help protect themselves: What to Do If You Are Sick What steps should I take if an attendee or staff person develops symptoms of COVID-19 while at an event? If a staff member or attendee becomes sick at an event, separate them from others as soon as possible and until they can go home. Provide a staff member or attendee with clean, to wear, if available. If not available, provide them with a cloth face covering, which can be improvised if needed from a tee shirt, bandana or other clothing, as well as a tissue or some other way to cover their coughs and sneezes. If needed, contact emergency services for those who need emergency care. Public transportation, shared rides, and taxis should be avoided for sick persons. Be sure to contact local public health officials regarding the possible case of COVID-19 at an event and how to communicate with staff and attendees about possible exposure to the virus.

				<paragraphs> What CDC is Doing for Cruise Travelers Since the No Sail Order was extended on April 15, CDC has worked with cruise lines to help thousands of crew members return home safely. Safe disembarkation of crew has included a requirement for cruise lines to submit a signed attestation and use non-commercial transportation for their crew members. The list on this page provides the latest information on cruise lines that have submitted the signed attestations that received CDC approval to safely disembark crew using noncommercial transportation. The list on this page is updated daily Monday through Friday. what CDC is doing to help cruise ship travelers Ships that have complete and accurate No Sail Order response plans to protect crew members against COVID-19 can now disembark crew members for non-commercial travel without a signed attestation Cruise company officials must sign an acknowledgement of the completeness and accuracy of their response plans. Ships that want to disembark crew members using commercial travel will need to meet certain additional eligibility requirements. For more information, visit CDC will continue to support urgent medical evacuations of crew in U. S. waters and ports, either by air or land ambulance. Emergency medical evacuations should be coordinated with U. S. Coast Guard and the receiving medical facility and do not require CDC approval. CDC has notified all cruise lines as well as federal, state, and local partners that the No Sail Order of April 15 will not prevent crew members from receiving emergency medical care. What are the requirements of the attestation that cruise lines are required to sign before crew can disembark, or transfer to another ship, if they do not have complete and accurate response plan under the No Sail Order? Cruise lines that do not have complete and accurate response plan under the No Sail Order must continue to submit a signed attestation to disembark their crew members by non-commercial travel. By signing the attestation form, cruise ship operators agree to follow specific conditions that are designed to allow crew to safely disembark while protecting public health, including the following: Arrange to transport crew members to their final destination (US or overseas) by industry-chartered private transport, industry-chartered private flights, or personal vehicles (no rental cars, taxis, or ride-share services) with measures in place to ensure neither those involved in transport nor other members of the public are exposed to the disembarking individuals. Screen disembarking crew members for symptoms of COVID-19. Ensure crew members with known exposures to COVID-19 are transported separately from those with no known exposure. Provide face coverings, such as a cloth face covering, to disembarking crew members or confirm that they have their own face coverings. Instruct disembarking crew members to stay home for 14 days and continue to practice social distancing after reaching their final destination.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>will not stay overnight in a hotel before the flight or at any point until they reach their final destination will not enter the public airport terminal will not take commercial aircraft after an initial charter flight will not have a transportation layover exceeding 8 hours will not have interaction with the public during their travel home or to their new duty station (e. g., rental car companies, restaurants, other public areas) Why is CDC requiring that cruise officials sign a legal attestation? Requiring a signed attestation helps ensure that the information provided by cruise officials as a condition of disembarking or transferring crew is truthful and accurate. By signing the legal attestation documents, cruise line officials certify that the information they provided to CDC is truthful and accurate. If the information they the information they provided to CDC is truthful and accurate, cruise line officials are subject to the criminal penalty provisions of 18 U. S.C. § 1001. It is common to ask corporate officials in other settings to certify that statements made to the U. S. Government on behalf of the corporate entity are truthful and accurate, such as in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing or when seeking payment reimbursement under Medicare. Complete and accurate response plans that cruise lines develop and implement incorporate all of the elements that are in the attestation form. CDC is not requiring a signed attestation to disembark crew for cruise lines with complete and accurate response plans, if the crew are disembarking by noncommercial means. Ships that want to disembark crew members using commercial transport will need to meet certain eligibility requirements and submit a separate attestation. For more information on the differences between the two attestation CDC requires, visit the Which ships can use commercial travel to transport crew members home? Under the extended No Sail Order, CDC established an enhanced surveillance process to provide a more complete picture of whether COVID-19 is present on cruise ships. Ships that meet certain requirements will be able to use commercial transportation to disembark crew members if they submit an attestation. Ships that meet certain requirements are also allowed to lessen certain restrictions designed to promote social distancing on the ship. Only cruise ships with complete and accurate response plans are eligible to submit an attestation. Why are legal penalties included in the attestation form? CDC requires cruise lines to sign an attestation form to verify that the information CDC provide to CDC is true and accurate. Legal penalties would only be applied if the cruise line knowingly submitted a false statement, which could pose further risk to the public’s health What are the legal penalties for knowingly submitting a false attestation form? The sentence for this crime can include 5 years in federal prison and a fine. Are ships required to comply with the No Sail Order if they are not operating in U. S. waters? CDC recommends that all cruise lines follow the same guidance for safe travel to protect the public’s health, including conducting a medical screening at disembarkation, providing face coverings, and advising crew members to stay home for 14 days after disembarking.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Cruise lines that are unable or unwilling to abide by all elements outlined in the Interim Guidance for Cruise Ships During the Period of the No Sail Order must remain entirely outside U. S. waters during the period of the NSO. Cruise ships that expect to operate in U. S. waters in any capacity or for any length of time must follow all elements outlined in the NSO and in the Interim Guidance, even while outside of U. S. waters. the NSO does not apply to ships operating entirely outside of U. S. and do not plan to return to U. S. waters. Foreign jurisdictions may impose their own restrictions or requirements on cruise ships. What is CDC doing to ensure cruise lines are adhering to the No Sail Order? for cruise ships during the period of the No Sail Order to help inform the plans that cruise lines develop to prevent, detect, contain, and respond to COVID-19 on their ships. CDC is committed to helping address crew members’ questions or concerns while onboard and as they disembark. Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions about the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their ship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share them with CDC by sending an email to CDC is also reminding all cruise lines in U. S. waters or seeking to operate in U. S. waters of these requirements. With the assistance of these requirements federal, state, and local partners, CDC stands ready to direct ships that do not comply to leave U. S. waters. CDC also reminds cruise ship operators that those who do not comply may be subject to criminal penalties.

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>, said: “Closing down large parts of  The British economy was always going to lead to a sharp fall in GDP. With only a slight gain into May, the danger is that the pandemic could lead to an economic crisis. ” Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The pickup in output in May is more likely to reflect the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen, rather than evidence of a genuine recovery. “While UK economic output may grow further in the short term as restrictions ease, this may dissipate as the economic scarring caused by the pandemic starts to bite, particularly as government support winds down. ” With thousands of companies temporarily closed to contain the spread of the virus, Britain dominant services sector – which makes up about 80% of  The British economy – grew by just 0. 9% on the month, dragged down by falling levels of activity in the arts, entertainment and recreation, as well as at estate agents and IT firms. Manufacturing and construction grew by more than 8% from the level of economic output in April, as activity at factories and on building sites began to recover with physical-distancing measures in place. Despite the gradual return to growth, the level of GDP did not recover from record declines in activity in March and April as the global health emergency led to widespread shutdowns in activity, with GDP about 24. 5% lower compared with February. The ONS said  The British economy shrank by 19% over the three month period to the end of May. Analysts expect GDP to fall again in the three months to June, in what would mark the second quarter of contraction after a decline of 2. 2% in the three months to March. Economists regard two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP as the technical definition of a recession. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at The ONS, said there had been a pickup in the retail sector, boosted by a record number of online sales. “However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines. ” Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The easing of lockdown restrictions as to reopen in May helped to boost retail activity by 12% compared with April. Over the three months to May, the biggest declines were recorded in the food and drink sector, with output plunging by 69. 3% due to the closure of bars and restaurants. There was also severe weakness in car sales, as well as the education sector with the closure of schools.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> The Covid-19 crisis is going to drive Britain’s national debt over 100% of GDP, for the first time since the 1960s, That’s because the public finances has suffered a double blow -- tax takings will be £133bn lower due to the weak economy, while spending will jump by £135bn due to efforts to cushion the impact of the pandemic. Higher cash borrowing and a smaller economy push public sector net debt (PSND) above 100 per cent of GDP for the first time since the early 1960s in all years of the scenario. Here’s the details of how tax bills will shrink: Income tax and NICs are £43.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>5 billion lower in 2020-21, due mostly to lower employment and earnings. Medium-term economic scarring leaves receipts £27. 6 billion lower than our March forecast in 2024-25. VAT is £32. 4 billion lower in 2020-21, thanks largely to lower consumer spending, with purchases of items taxed at the standard rate hit harder than spending in aggregate. VAT receipts remain £14. 1 billion below our March forecast in 2024-25. Corporation tax receipts are £20. 3 billion lower in 2020-21, thanks to much weaker profits, plus much higher losses that can be used to offset past and future liabilities. Receipts remain £6. 0 billion below our March forecast in 2024-25. Fuel duty receipts are £4.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>7 billion lower in 2020-21, reflecting the lockdown, with some persistence across the scenario due to the weaker path for economic activity. Air passenger duty is hit particularly hard due to the collapse in air travel. In 2020-21, receipts fall by nearly two-thirds and are £2. 7 billion below our March forecast. Other significant shortfalls are seen in business rates (mostly due to the business rates holidays for some sectors), capital gains tax and stamp duty land tax. The Office for Budget Responsibility doesn’t believe a V-shaped recovery is very likely either. is that the UK economy won’t return to its pre-crisis levels until the end of 2022. In other words, it would take more than two years to recover the output lost in March and April. But the OBR also says the pace of the recovery is ‘highly uncertain’. the OBR depends on several factors: the amount of scarring suffered by the UK economy, such as unemployment; whether (and when) effective vaccines and other treatments to crush Covid-19 are developed; how fast the lockdown is lifted; and whether government action to protect the economy works. So, the the OBR has drawn up three scenarios. The optimistic one does show rapid recovery, but the pessimistic one looks more like an L than a V. , activity rebounds relatively quickly, recovering the OBR pre-virus peak by the first quarter of 2021, and there is no enduring economic scarring. output recovers more slowly, regaining its pre-virus peak by the end of 2022. Cumulative business investment is 6 per cent lower than in the March forecast over five years, while unemployment and business failures remain elevated. Real GDP is 3 per cent lower in the first quarter of 2025 than in our March forecast. output recovers even more slowly, returning to its pre-virus peak only in the third quarter of 2024. This results in a more significant loss of business investment, more firm failures and persistently high unemployment as the economy undergoes significant restructuring. Real GDP is 6 per cent lower in the first quarter of 2025 than in our March forecast. OBR: UK facing worst slump in 300 years Newsflash: the economy is on track for the economy worst year in three centuries, and the economy biggest ever budget deficit in peacetime. That’s according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s independent fiscal watchdog.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In a new report, OBR outlines three scenarios for the future -- and all three show the worst recession in 300 years, and a massive spike in borrowing. The coronavirus outbreak and the public health measures taken to contain it have delivered one of the largest ever shocks to the UK economy and public finances. Our three medium-term scenarios (upside, central and downside) see the largest decline in annual GDP for 300 years this year, accompanied by an unprecedented peacetime rise in its biggest ever budget deficit in peacetime to between 13 and 21 per cent of GDP, and debt rising above 100 per cent of GDP in all but the upside scenario. The pandemic has worsened the baseline against which existing long-term pressures on fiscal sustainability will be felt, and has materially altered our assessment of future fiscal risks. In The pandemic ‘central scenario’, OBR predicts public sector net borrowing will hit £322bn or 16 per cent of GDP, in the current financial year -- the highest peacetime level in at least 300 years. That, though, doesn’t include the £30bn of measures announced by Rishi Sunak last week. One of the messages from today GDP report is that Britain’s recovery is uneven - with manufacturing growing 8%, but services barely expanding at all. journalist Paul Mason says this shows the need for ‘targeted’ support, to help struggling companies keep workers on. 2/ The sector story is crucial. This is why we need a targeted extension of furlough. .. 3/ But all this is meaningless until we know if there&apos;s a second wave of the virus. This slump took place DESPITE a massive fiscal/ monetary stimulus. OECD says, if there&apos;s a double hit, GDP will slump 21% in the three months to Xmas. .. The pound has lost ground against the US dollar and the euro this morning. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the dollar at $1. 251, and a third of a eurocent at €1.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>1037, as traders digest the news that Britain’s economy grew by less than hoped in May The pound was already suffering from a move into safe-haven currencies after that late wobble on Wall Street last night, and has kept moving down. “Sterling extended a selloff after the GDP numbers disappointed,” says The UK is already seeing what a non-V recovery looks like. GDP growth rebounded 1. 8% in May, which was well short of the 5. 5% expected. In the three months to May, Britain’s economy contracted by 19. 1%. Some of the numbers are truly horrendous and it’s hard to see how Britain’s economy can deliver the +20% rebound required to get back to 2019 with confidence sapped like Britain’s economy is and unemployment set to rise sharply says the UK government should be very wary of withdrawing its stimulus measures: “This morning’s data shows that Britain’s economy needs ongoing policy support; support measures already in place should be withdrawn only very cautiously. “The early stage recovery in The UK was weaker than expected, but this is unlikely to be the final word on what happened to Britain’s economy in May, with the ONS citing more uncertainty than usual around the GDP estimates. ” Hopes that Britain’s economy could achieve a rapid, or V-shaped, recovery from the crisis have taken a knock today. “The bounce-back from COVID-19 has got off to a disappointing start. The pace of activity will have picked up sharply in June as the easing of the lockdown got underway. The chances of a quick return to normal, of the famed V-shaped recovery, are falling.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“It is likely to take years, not months, to repair the damage to Britain’s economy by COVID-19. ” investment director at Fidelity International, warns that growth may not accelerate if people are unwilling to return to the shops, or are quite happy to keep working from home: Hopes of a V-shaped recovery are fading fast, and I suspect we’re looking at something resembling far more of a ‘W’ - a series of improvements and relapses, before a proper recovery takes hold. “Pent-up demand amongst consumers suggests that we may see some spikes in activity as shops and restaurants re-open, flights resume, and workers continue their gradual return to the office. However, this upwards trajectory may be flatter and the recovery take longer than we hoped. It is one thing opening up, another persuading consumers to return to their old ways. “Of course, many are hoping that initial signs of recovery may buoy confidence, and that we see a positive feedback between higher spending and lower unemployment.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The thinking here is that early demand as the economy re-opens will persuade employers to retain staff in anticipation that their services will be needed - if not immediately, then very soon.

Amazingly, the charm offensive worked, but Houston had already gone. “I was crushed,”  hen Brandy Norwood was 14 sighs. “My mom was like: ‘You’ll meet  hen Brandy Norwood was 14 when you put music out. ’” That same year, 1993, Brandy signed to Atlantic Records. A year later, Brandy released Brandy Grammy-nominated, self-titled debut.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>By 1996, Brandy was the star of the teen sitcom Moesha, and, in 1997, Brandy was hand-picked by Houston to play the title role in a TV remake of Cinderella. “So I’m working with Brandy side by side,” Brandy says, eyes wide. “It’s just something that’s still surreal to this day. ” For a period in the late 90s and early 00s it felt as if Brandy, AKA the fan-ordained “vocal Bible”, was being fast-tracked for Houston-level success. Brandy second album, 1998’s Never Say Never, sold 16m copies worldwide, thanks in part to its lead single . A playfully confrontational duet with fellow R&amp;B upstart Monica, 16m copies spent 13 weeks at No 1 in the US, finishing as the year’s best-selling single. Its opulent sound – fluttering harps, cascading backing vocals, elasticated bass – rewired the genre, with its then-unknown co-producer Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins and co-writer going on to craft era-defining hits for the likes of and Houston herself. A year later, now one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Brandy was given her own line of Barbie dolls. “A black Barbie with braids and little baby hairs coming out,” Brandy smiles. “Truly unbelievable. ” While there were other hits – Have You Ever, What About Us? , Talk About Us Love – by 2005 Brandy’s commercial appeal had stalled. In 2006, Brandy was involved in a fatal road accident (a topic very much off the table during Us interview) that forced Brandy to quit as a judge on America’s Got Talent. While subsequent albums showed flashes of brilliance, they were often undermined by Brandy rocky relationship with music itself. “Sometimes you get caught up in being popular and relevant, and that makes you lose the reason why you’re connected to music,” Brandy says. “I’m scared of that. I don’t ever want to get to a point where I’m doing music for the wrong reasons. ” The good news is that the soulful B7 – Brandy first album in eight years – sounds like the work of an artist re-energised, with those trademark vocal flexes cocooned in outre production and playful throwback moments such as lead single Baby Mama’s celebration of her 18-year-old daughter, Sy’rai. The good news also arrives at the perfect time: the 41-year-old is now feted as a massive influence on modern R&amp;B, with 2002’s glitchy, UK garage-influenced Full Moon and 2004’s sumptuous Afrodisiac – lauded by everyone from It is not just turn-of-the-millennium nostalgia. In 2013, shortly after the release of Brandy’s sixth album Two Eleven, which featured input from self-confessed stan Frank Ocean, Solange tweeted at white music critics: “Like you really should know about deep Brandy album cuts before you are giving a ‘grade’ or a ‘score’ to any R&amp;B artist.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” It’s those deep cuts that keep drawing other modern R&amp;B practitioners to Solange back catalogue, from . Can Solange hear Solange influence in R&amp;B now? “Yes … ” Solange says coyly. “A lot. And it’s so flattering. ” Brandy Norwood was always destined to be a singer. As a young child Solange would accompany Solange dad, a gospel vocalist and choir director, to their local church in Mississippi. “Watching what people’s voices did to audiences, I wanted to see if my voice could do a little of that,” Solange recalls. When Solange was four, Solange family moved to LA. A talent show regular, Solange demo CD eventually found its way to Atlantic; when the label signed Solange, Brandy’s mum became Solange manager. A year after Solange debut album made Solange a teen star, Solange landed the title role in Moesha, a sitcom based around the upper-middle class Mitchell family. Brandy, playing a headstrong character on TV each week, was quickly defined as the ultimate good girl next door, a perception that meant Solange had to hide a relationship with the Boyz II Men singer Wanya Morris, five years Solange senior. Solange says that following “this perfection map” meant people were constantly waiting for Solange to slip up, a fear that raised its head again in 2004 when Sy’rai’s father, the producer Robert Smith, revealed the pair faked their 2001 marriage to preserve the singer’s reputation.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“When I started to make mistakes I was judged harshly at times,” Solange says. “That got very difficult for Solange. ” When The Boy Is Mine came out, Brandy’s leap from teen star to adult artist was cemented. The song, inspired by the domestic arguments on , came with its own in-built tabloid narrative of warring women. Fiction was assumed to be fact as stories swirled about altercations between Brandy and Monica. Brandy laments that the gossip around their friendship meant they only performed the song together once, at the . “For us to be put against each other like that, I didn’t think that was funny at all,” Brandy says “us didn’t really get a chance to experience what us could have with The Boy Is Mine. The fanbases and the media really threw a wrench in that experience. ” Outside interference has dampened other career peaks, too. Having crafted Afrodisiac alongside producer Timbaland, Brandy label lined up newcomer Kanye West for extra sessions, eventually insisting, much to Brandy’s protestations, that the lead single be their collaboration, Talk About us Love. “I like that song now,” Brandy insists, “but back then I was like ‘nope’. ” that song was such a last-minute decision that Brandy had already started rehearsing for the video shoot for the Timbaland-produced Black Pepper, a song that didn’t make the final tracklisting and has since taken up mythic status.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“It definitely exists,” Brandy confirms. “I just, erm, don’t know where it is. ” The Guide: Staying In – sign up for us home entertainment tips Two songs that did make it on to Afrodisiac sample Brandy favourite band Coldplay, while Full Moon’s layered vocals were heavily influenced by castle-dwelling, ethereal Irish warbler Enya. When I playfully question Brandy taste Brandy suddenly grows animated. “Enya’s a joke to you? ” Brandy says, both eyebrows arched. “her favourite band Coldplay? A joke? That’s not even possible. I’m a little bit offended. ” Brandy changes tack when Brandy realises I’m geographically closer to Enya, Brandy dream collaborator. “Actually, can you make Brandy and Enya happen? Don’t just laugh. If you have connects to the castle let me know. ” For now, Enya can wait. While in many ways B7, released via Brandy own label, is classic Brandy, off-kilter production anchored by a voice still deep enough to swim in, it also feels like a fresh start. No more placating egos, no more chasing commercial expectations. Having previously had Brandy experiences distilled into other people’s words, Brandy is now credited as a co-writer on every song, often alongside Brandy early mentor LaShawn Daniels, who helped turn those burning ambitions into reality.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Tragically, Daniels died last September during the making of the album. “It’s a little scary because I had to finish it without him,” Brandy says, dabbing away tears. “I just wonder: would him be proud of what I was able to put together? ” Brandy takes a breath. “Music is my therapy,” Brandy nods, almost to Brandy. “I don’t know what my life would be without it.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> t sounds like a sci-fi movie, or the weirdest series of Big Brother ever. Eight volunteers wearing snazzy red jumpsuits seal themselves into a hi-tech glasshouse that’s meant to perfectly replicate Earth’s ecosystems. Eight volunteers wearing snazzy red jumpsuits end up starving, gasping for air and at each other’s throats – while the world’s media looks on. But the Biosphere 2 experiment really did happen. Running from 1991 to 1993, the Biosphere 2 experiment is remembered as a failure, if the Biosphere 2 experiment is remembered at all – a hubristic, pseudo-scientific experiment that was never going to accomplish the Biosphere 2 experiment mission. However, as the new documentary Spaceship Earth shows, the escapade is a cautionary tale, now that the outside world – Biosphere 1, if you prefer – is itself coming to resemble an apocalyptic sci-fi world. Looking back, you prefer –’s amazing that Biosphere 2 even happened at all, not least because the people behind you prefer – started out as a hippy theatre group. “Just the fact that the same number of people came out as went in is a triumph,” says , one of the original eight “biospherians”. Far from a failure, the same number of people regards Biosphere 2 as an unsung achievement in human exploration, as do many others. “I like to say we built it not because we had the answers. we built it to find out what we didn’t know. ” Ziggurat … the futuristic Biosphere 2 complex in the Arizona desert. Photograph: John Miller/AP Biosphere 2’s origins lie in late-1960s San Francisco, and Allen.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Already in his 40s by then, Allen was something of a renaissance man: a Harvard graduate, a metallurgist, a union organiser, a beat poet, and a traveller studying indigenous cultures. Allen founded an idealistic performance group called the Theatre of All Possibilities. As the name suggests, they wanted to change the world but weren’t sure where to start. Art? Business? Ecology? Technology? In classic counterculture fashion, they decided: “Let’s do all of it! ” they didn’t actually know how to do any of it, save for staging somewhat freeform performances, but “learn by doing” was Allen’s philosophy – and it took they surprisingly far. In 1969, Allen’s troupe relocated to New Mexico and founded ’s concept of synergy, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. “He was a ball of energy,” says Nelson, who joined Allen’s troupe around that time, when he was 22. “He had a great feel for both ecology and theatre. And frankly, He was a very charismatic guy. We’d accomplish one thing, then say, ‘What’s the new challenge? ’ He was forever upping the ante. ” They turned their desert ranch into a self-sufficient homestead, planting trees and raising buildings, including a Buckminster Fuller . They founded an art gallery in London (it is still running) and bought another ranch in Australia. In 1975, They even decided to build a ship. They chief designer was a 19-year-old student with no experience of boatbuilding, but it proved perfectly seaworthy. They sailed around the world for several years, researching the Earth’s ecosystems.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Having learned how They worked, They were ready to build They own. If humankind was going to settle other planets, they reasoned, it would need to learn how to replicate Earth.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>For a generation that came of age with the moon landings and such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Biosphere 2 launch was staged like a space mission. The media descended on the $150m facility, all gleaming white panels and ziggurats of glass, filled with forests, deserts, laboratories, recycling systems, pigs, chickens, hummingbirds, bush babies, and even a coral reef. There were speeches and fireworks as the jumpsuited volunteers (four women, four men, all white) sealed themselves in for the two-year journey into the unknown.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>After a stable start, problems began to emerge. Food, for one. “We really could have used more calories,” says Linda Leigh, another biospherian. Linda Leigh had been involved with stocking Biosphere 2 with wild plants, but many of the food crops were too slow or too labour-intensive to be worthwhile. The wild coffee bushes took a fortnight to produce enough for one cup. Rather than luxuriating in a Garden of Eden, the biospherians were like subsistence farmers. There was a lot of beetroot Rather than luxuriating in a Garden of Eden, the biospherians became more like subsistence farmers. There was a lot of beetroot and sweet potato. “It was a challenge to make exciting meals,” says Linda Leigh. “We’d rotate the cooking duties. Some people created new things like a taco-shaped like a dinosaur. Some people made horrible things like cold potato leaf soup. ” Everyone lost a lot of weight. On top of that, oxygen levels decreased faster than anticipated, with a corresponding build-up of carbon dioxide. Earth’s atmosphere is about 21% oxygen, but inside Biosphere 2 Biosphere 2 fell to 14. 2 %. “It felt like mountain-climbing,” Nelson recalls. “Some of the crew started getting sleep apnoea. I noticed I couldn’t finish a long sentence without stopping and taking a breath of air. We worked in a kind of slow-motion dance, with no energy wasted.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>If the oxygen levels had dropped any lower, there could have been serious health issues. ” Linda Leigh at work … coachloads of tourists came to see the project. Photograph: Courtesy of NEON Understandably, morale deteriorated. Living under biosphere conditions was a challenge at the best of times. If the coronavirus lockdown feels restrictive, imagine spending two years with the same seven people and no internet. Nelson likens it to “a marathon group therapy session”. Added to which, true to their theatrical origins, the biospherians were on permanent display. Coachloads of tourists and schoolchildren arrived daily to tap on the glass and take pictures of the crew. Linda Leigh remembers anthropologist coming to visit.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“Linda Leigh observed We like We were captive primates. ” Cups were thrown and people were spat at, but thankfully there was no violence. “It was more of a coldness,” says Linda Leigh. “Of not wanting to be around each other. ” The team split into two camps of four: “We group was all for bringing in extra food and more oxygen just to keep things going, so We own suffering didn’t impact the work that needed to be done. Our group had other ideas. ” In other words, keep Biosphere 2’s closed and retain the purity of the experiment, no matter the cost. A similar debate was going on outside. Biosphere 2’s difficulties had not gone unnoticed, though Allen and The team had tried to conceal them. Eventually extra food was smuggled in and two oxygen pop-ups followed. The biospherians were overjoyed. “People starting laughing like crazy and running around,” recalls Nelson. “I felt like I’d been 90 years old and now I was a teenager again. I realised I hadn’t seen anybody running for months.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” But on the outside, as debate raged in the media, the project started to be dismissed as non-science, or as one commentator put it, “trendy ecological entertainment”. Everything you did, you could see the impact of the project. My body suddenly got the message: every time you breathe, these plants are waiting for your CO2 Nelson certainly doesn’t see it that way. “Somehow or other, it all got truncated into: ‘This is a survival test for this colony, and the one and only measure of success is whether everything works perfectly, and there’s no necessity to bring in anything from the outside. ’ That was never the intention. ” the intention, in fact, was to continue the experiment, learning from their mistakes. A second mission went into the biosphere in March 1994, and looked to be faring better. A month later, though, out of the blue, Ed Bass decided on a mass purge. The purpose was to make the project more businesslike, it seems. Allen and his team were swiftly ejected and a new CEO was literally helicoptered in: Steve Bannon. Yes, that . Investment banker, future right-wing operator and Donald Trump strategist. As a metaphor for the fate of the planet, it could hardly be more apt. “I look at it as a story about human ambition, it possibilities and limitations,” says Matt Wolf, director of . “I think the experiment revealed that humans are the most unstable element of a closed system. ” Like many, Matt Wolf was only dimly aware of the project before Matt Wolf started looking into the project.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Many of the original biospherians still live together on Synergia Ranch, Matt Wolf discovered, including Nelson and Allen, now in Matt Wolf 90s. Fortunately, he discovered, including Nelson and Allen, now in his 90s recorded everything: Matt Wolf had access to over 600 hours of 16mm film and video. Biosphere 2 is now managed by the University of Arizona. Linda Leigh runs a community garden project in Oracle, a few miles away. Transformed … Spaceship Earth director Matt Wolf, left, and producer Stacey Reiss with Linda Leigh and Nelson now. Photograph: Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP Both Nelson and Linda Leigh would happily volunteer to go back in. Both Nelson and Leigh were transformed by the experience, in a way Both Nelson and Leigh wish society as a whole could emulate. “Inside Biosphere 2, everything made sense,” says Nelson. “Everything you did, you could see the impact of it. No anonymous actions. It was like my body suddenly got the message: every time you breathe, these plants are waiting for your CO2. these plants are your third lung. I thought, ‘My God, this is keeping me alive! I am absolutely metabolically connected to the life here. ’” Even if history does judge Biosphere 2 a failure, is that really so bad? “The media can be very dismissive of people trying new things,” says Matt Wolf. “So much so that people hesitate to try for fear of criticism or failure. If everybody feared failure, they would never try new and ambitious things. ” Earth is available on digital platforms and in cinemas now.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> As luxury fashion tries to adapt to the coronavirus crisis with a run of digital events, the men’s collection showed another timely shift as it confronted the issue of diversity on the catwalk. One week after the brand was criticised for casting an all-white ensemble of models for its womenswear couture presentation, the artistic director of menswear, Kim Jones, featured only black models in his spring/summer 2021 collection, which was designed in collaboration with the acclaimed Ghanaian portrait painter Amoako Boafo. “It’s not political: we started this back in December,” said Jones, speaking from his London home. “But one of the things designers can do is [reflect] the time they are in. For me, diversity is a natural thing; a reflection of the wider world. ” The collection, titled Portrait of an Artist, was shown as a two-part presentation that began with one film shot in London and at Boafo’s studio in by video artist Chris Cunningham, and a second, showcasing the clothes, which was filmed in a catwalk-like setting to a Max Richter soundtrack. Jones was inspired by Boafo’s Black Diaspora series, which explores Jones identity and black masculinity. an Artist influence was ubiquitous, with Jones transposing the works on to clothes, in some cases hand-painting the portraits on to coats and knitwear or simply borrowing from the print or mood of a portrait.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>There were tailored shorts of varying lengths and ribbed knits in neon yellow and pink. Sheer shirts, trenchcoats and parkas came in pastels, while jacquard patterns mimicked a painted canvas. The models wore desert boots or socks and sandals, most sported a single earring and several wore a Jones beret.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The latter accessory provided the show’s talking point. The collection’s e-invitation featured Boafo’s Green Beret portrait of a man in an ivy leaf print shirt and green beret. His earlier work has referenced the Black Panther movement, for which berets and polo necks, another feature of the collection, have become emblematic.</paragraphs>

Pam Boy, a senior editor at Love magazine, pointed to the fact the Dior designer had spent part of his childhood in various African countries. “Kim Jones is part of the very exclusive club of white Africans, that’s why he didn’t miss a beat with his Dior SS21,” he tweeted. Formerly of Louis Vuitton, Kim Jones has become well known for merging suiting with streetwear, and reworking tailoring for a modern audience. These commercially successful partnerships have helped to make Dior the world’s biggest luxury brand. Ivy prints and polo necks featured in the spring/summer collection.

Kim Jones says Kim Jones team at the Dior workshop in the capital followed coronavirus guidelines throughout. “I’ve seen very few people apart from his team at the Dior workshop in the capital. We’ve been isolating so we could work together,” Kim Jones said. “My main concern is how young designers and businesses will be affected and what We can do to support them. ” But Kim Jones remains hopeful the industry can overcome the economic fallout from the pandemic. “Let’s not forget Christian Dior was born out of the ashes of the second world war,” Kim Jones said.

				<paragraphs> claimed to have done so much for African Americans that his campaign decided to open the first ever Republican office in a black neighbourhood of Milwaukee. White House attacks Fauci as states see record new coronavirus cases – live updates The office on Martin Luther King drive was decorated with “Black Voters for Trump” signs, and launched with fanfare in February in an attempt to win enough African American votes to repeat the president’s razor-thin victory in four years ago, which was crucial to winning the White House. Two weeks later, the windows were daubed with paint and “scum” scrawled across the door. Not long after that, the coronavirus pandemic shut down campaigning. Now The office on Martin Luther King drive is back up and running, but in a very different electoral landscape from the one that existed in February. Covid-19 has shattered the illusion that Trump could take significant numbers of African American votes following Trump hostility to the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of George Floyd’s killing. George Floyd’s mishandling of the pandemic – which has had a disproportionate impact on communities of colour – has also been a factor. Outside his apartment a block from the Trump campaign office, Cleophus Lobley acknowledged that he helped elect the president in 2016 by not voting. The African American truck driver said the events of the past few months mean he won’t make that mistake again. “Damn right I’m not happy with Trump. To The African American truck driver, The African American truck driver’s really a very prejudiced person. The African American truck driver’s been bad for the black community,” The African American truck driver said. “I’m not just talking about Covid and George Floyd, but that made things worse. That’s the kind of president he is. I decided I would vote this time because of he. Maybe my vote might count. I don’t know anyone around here who will vote for he. ” Cleophus Lobley was among 40,000 people in Milwaukee who voted for Barack Obama but failed to turn out for Hillary Clinton in 2016, including a significant proportion from black neighbourhoods. 40,000 people in Milwaukee who voted for Barack Obama absence was more than enough to give victory to Trump. He won Wisconsin by just 23,000 votes – a margin of victory of 0.</paragraphs>

If He is to stay in power, the president almost certainly needs to repeat that victory while also winning Michigan and Pennsylvania, two other states he took by tiny margins. suffered stinging setbacks with the loss of the governor’s office in 2018, and in April they lost a key seat on the state supreme court alongside a failed attempt to purge the voting roll of 200,000 people before November’s election. The scale of the Jill Karofsky’s victory in the supreme court race over a sitting justice who was strongly backed by Trump, and the fact of a high turnout despite long lines because so many polling places were closed by coronavirus, gave Democrats reason to hope that their supporters are more engaged with politics than four years ago. This would be bad news for the president. “the president’s got a tougher road here than the president had in March’’ by Marquette law school in Milwaukee gave the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, an eight-point lead over the president in June, a five-point increase on a month earlier. The survey showed rising disapproval in the state for ’s job performance, linked to the president handling of coronavirus but also the Black Lives Matter protests. More than half said Trump has got Trump wrong in dealing with Covid-19. Just 30% of voters approved of the president response to the killing of Floyd and the demands for police reform. Even on the president strongest issue, the economy, ’s approval rating fell four points to 50%. Crucially, opposition has grown among independents who were instrumental in delivering Wisconsin to the president four years ago. Disapproval of ’s leadership among independent voters in Wisconsin surged from 36% to 57% between May and June. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette poll, said that “intense negativity” is to the Democrats’ advantage if it motivates people to vote. “’s in trouble. Trump’s in troubTrump’s in trouble got a tougher road here – a considerably tougher road than Trump’s in trouble was facing back in March, when it looked like a very tight race. There seem to be cracks in the nearly unanimous Republican support and a loss of independent support,” Trump’s in trouble said. It’s a picture found in travelling across Wisconsin over the last week, from its main cities to the rural wilds of the north of Wisconsin where Trump did so well four years ago. Republican activists there are increasingly concerned at eroding support for the president and what they see as his lack of a coherent strategy or policies to regain it, particularly on key issues such as healthcare, which has taken on added resonance in the middle of the pandemic. Some county party chairs privately wonder if Trump has already given up hope of re-election because, they say, the president continues to repeat the divisive behaviour that has damaged the president presidency, as well as taking highly controversial decisions such as commuting Roger Stone’s prison sentence.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Franklin said he had been particularly surprised by the president’s low polling over Black Lives Matter. “To the extent that Roger Stone’s reaction to the protest is seen as opposing the valid reasons for the protests, Trump is on the wrong side of public opinion – even here in Wisconsin with our 80-something per cent white population,” Trump said. “That issue of race and Confederate statues and patriotism, as Trump sees it, is not playing to a strong suit for Trump right now. ” ‘There is no such thing as democratic socialism. It’s the same as democratic Auschwitz’ That was not immediately evident at the Wisconsin Republican convention in Green Bay on Saturday, where party leaders largely sidestepped mention of coronavirus, other than to call it a “communist China-exported plague”, in favour of an assault on Black Lives Matter that marked out the ground the party wants to fight the election on. “We’ve seen violent mobs taking to the streets in order to erase our history,” Congressman Mike Gallagher, who represents a Wisconsin district, told the conference. Katrina Pierson, the former spokeswoman for Trump 2016 and an adviser to this year’s campaign, said that as a black woman she thought it important that Republicans remind African American voters it was their party under Lincoln that freed those who were enslaved. In an effort to stir that awakening, the party is pushing the widely derided claim that “nobody has ever done more” for African Americans than Trump in creating jobs for minorities, criminal justice reform and combating poverty. But Katrina Pierson undermined Katrina Pierson own case with language sure to alienate large numbers of black voters. “The Black Voices for Trump coalition will be taking on Black Lives Matter. We have the candidate that has the policies that prove black lives matter, because he believes that all lives matter,” Katrina Pierson said.

Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian A Soviet defector, Yuri Maltsev, broadened the attack on the Democrats by warning the dangers of democratic socialism. The Republican party, he said, is all that stands between freedom and communist “slavery”. “There is no such thing as democratic socialism. It’s the same as democratic Auschwitz,” he said, to some gasps. Trump’sThe Republican party was one of the few to go ahead with an in-person state convention this year. Few of the mostly elderly delegates were wearing masks, in a reflection of how widely their use is now seen as a political statement in parts of the country. Among delegates to an in-person state convention there was no great confidence in a strategy of attacking Black Lives Matter and painting the Democrats as Stalinists. Vicky Ostrey, representing Germantown on the edge of Milwaukee, was not confident Trump will win.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“I think it’s going to be a tough re-election,” she said, reflecting a view widely heard from Republican activists, particularly in rural Wisconsin where Trump needs to win big again to offset any surge in re-motivated Democratic voters in the cities. I think a lot of younger, more progressive voters see this as a referendum on ’s presidency, not just coronavirus The threat to ’s grip on the White House comes not only from a resurgence in the Democratic vote, but in the loss of independent and moderate Republican support in Wisconsin. That has been steadily eroding as the president alienates former voters piecemeal with the president assaults on the military, the justice system and broader democratic norms. Democrats still lose in Waukesha county west of Milwaukee, one of three solidly Republican counties around Milwaukee seen as an important test of ’s ability to hold on to the support of prosperous college educated voters. But Democratic candidates have taken an increasing share of the ballot in recent elections for the US Senate, governor and state supreme court. Matt Lowe, the 29 year-old chair of Trump’s in trouble Democrats, attributes that in part to Republican voters abandoning Trump, but also to a shift in priorities of those Democrats who are not enthusiastic about Biden. “I think a lot of younger, more progressive voters see this as a referendum on Trump whole presidency, not just coronavirus,” Trump said. “I’m a millennial who is also straight, white, cis, living in a fluid community. I know that if Trump is elected for four more years I will most likely be OK as an individual. “But I know that my LGBT friends, my friends of colour, the friends who are less likely to be as safe in a Trump America, they will not be OK. For a lot of younger voters who may be more idealistic, radical, my LGBT friends, my friends of colour, the friends who are less likely to be as safe in a Trump America, they will not be OK see that this is more than my LGBT friends, my friends of colour, the friends who are less likely to be as safe in a Trump America, they will not be OK ideology. this’s about protecting those who need my LGBT friends, my friends of colour, the friends who are less likely to be as safe in a Trump America, they will not be OK as allies to vote to help protect my LGBT friends, my friends of colour, the friends who are less likely to be as safe in a Trump America, they will not be OK. this’s a motivation to vote. ” Still, there are still four months to the election in a year in which events have moved fast. Franklin said the president could win back support if the economy improves over the summer, but warned that ’s pushing for the reopening of schools and universities will damage the president if it resulted in a surge in coronavirus cases in the run-up to the election. There is also the question of how the pandemic will affect voting, particularly if many polling stations are closed in the major cities as they were for April’s elections, causing long lines. But some voters waited for hours to cast their ballot, reflecting an apparent determination to counter Trump. More than 60% voted by mail, an option likely to be widely taken up for the election. Whatever it takes, Lobley is determined to be heard this time, even if he is not hugely enthused by Biden. “Biden talks good, but BidBiden trying to get the majority of black people on Biden side to get the votes. I know what Biden’s doing,” Biden said. “But the important thing is to get rid of the president.</paragraphs>

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>When Cory’s was in utero, doctors expected Cory’s to be a girl. When Cory’s was delivered, the medical staff in the room looked stunned and went silent. Cory’s was born with a phallus, which is medically atypical for individuals with two X chromosomes. “Cory’s had what the medical establishment considers ‘ambiguous’ genitalia,” Carol says. (Some names have been changed. ) “Everyone but me realized that this was an intersex child. And I think the fear in the room was that I would be disappointed. ” But while doctors and nurses appeared puzzled, Carol wasn’t nearly as concerned about Carol child’s sex. “I didn’t really care,” Carol says.</paragraphs>

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” Doctors pressured Carol and John to allow them to perform cosmetic surgeries on Cory’s in order to remove Cory’s phallus and “normalize” Cory’s genitalia. For years, intersex activists have pushed for bans on surgeries on intersex children.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In January this year, California lawmakers rejected what would have been a first-of-its-kind ban on medically unnecessary procedures and treatments performed on infants born with atypical genitalia. For many intersex kids and their families, this legislative defeat is a signal of the work that remains to be done to protect the autonomy of intersex individuals. Parents like Carol argue that irreversible physical and psychological harm can result from these surgeries. “I thought that was a terrible idea,” Carol says. “If you remove something, it’s gone forever. Who knows if this person is going to grow up to want to have a vagina or to have penetrative sex? And whose business is it to make these decisions except the person? ” Seven years later, Carol and John are relieved that they did not opt for surgery because, although he was given a female name at birth, Cory now identifies as a boy. Cory has begun seeing a gender clinician as Cory embarks upon Cory gender transition to become Cory fully realized self, as a boy. Through the years, ParentsCoryke Carol have maintained an open dialogue with Cory, adamant in Parents like Carol shared belief that Cory should take the lead in telling the world about Cory gender identity. Being intersex – an umbrella term for unique variations in reproductive or sex anatomy – is more common than one might think. The percentage of people born on the intersex spectrum is roughly the same percentage as people who are born as twins – about 1. 7% of people, according to a Human Rights Watch . And about one in 2,000 babies is born with genitalia different enough from what is considered standard that doctors might recommend surgery. The HRW report provides a searing analysis of the frequency and potentially devastating impact of forced genital surgeries performed on intersex kids at birth. Many in the media have referred to such surgeries as “ , an advocacy group for intersex youth. “So parental consent right now is ‘consent’. We want the individual to lead such decisions and for children to be able to understand what’s happening to their bodies. ” According to Lindahl, when doctors don’t assign a gender to intersex children, and instead allow them to explore gender on their own terms, intersex kids are able to thrive and forge their own identities. But when intersex kids are subjected to forced surgeries, the results can be devastating, sometimes leading to nerve damage, incontinence, scarring and diminished sexual function.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Additionally, there is a chance that doctors could incorrectly assign a child’s gender, as there is no way to know how the child will identify when they mature. Doing so can cause tremendous suffering and psychological distress for the intersex individual. &apos;It’s how I feel. It’s not how you feel&apos;: four teens explain why they reject the gender binary The entire intersex healthcare system assumes that intersex individuals want their bodies to be surgically altered; but while some intersex people desire medical intervention, countless others feel no need for “correction” because they don’t view being intersex as a malignancy or deformity, but simply as a variation. “When people hear that someone is intersex and they know what intersex means, they automatically assume they’ve been through trauma,” says Sarah, a mom to an intersex child, Rae, who uses they/them pronouns.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>(Names have been changed. ) “We were definitely advised that surgery was the best option and that Rae has testes in their lower abdomen,” Sarah says.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“[The doctors] wanted to do the surgeries necessary to solidify a female gender assignment. ” Sarah and Rob, Rae’s father, resisted the advice of their doctors. Sarah and Rob, Rae’s father believe that we need to create more space for parents to feel relaxed about raising their intersex kids, instead of immediately pursuing life-altering options that a minor is in no position to agree to. Sarah and Rob, Rae’s father also wanted to make sure that Rae could carve out Sarah and Rob, Rae’s father own gender path. Rae previously identified as male, but now identifies as non-binary, experimenting with fluid and evolving modes of dress and presentation. Rae has also found community and friendship among other queer young people. Rae “is the happiest child,” Sarah says. “So much of what we read about intersex people focuses on suffering. I’ve been asked if I think [Rae] will ever have a phase where intersex people wish intersex people weren’t intersex. The answer is no. intersex people love intersex people uniqueness. ” When asked if intersex people had any advice for other intersex kids coming to terms with intersex people gender, Rae simply responded: “Be yourself no matter what. ” Although Rae and Cory learned of their intersex variations early on, many intersex people don’t until their teenage years or adulthood.</paragraphs>

Fatima Mahmudi was about to embark on a field trip overseas and Fatima Mahmudi parents decided to tell Fatima Mahmudi in case a medical situation presented itself while Fatima Mahmudi was outside their care. “her parents told me I had a growth in my abdomen that was removed when I was a child,” Mahmudi, now 22, says. “I later found out her parents were referring to my undescended testes. I remember crying to my friend because my entire vision of the future had just changed. ” Gradually, Fatima Mahmudi learned that Fatima Mahmudi was born with XY chromosomes, and the pills Fatima Mahmudi was given every day were hormone replacement medications that Fatima Mahmudi would need for the rest of Fatima Mahmudi life. For Fatima Mahmudi, learning that Fatima Mahmudi was intersex had no bearing on Fatima Mahmudi gender identity. “I’ve always known I was a girl,” Fatima Mahmudi says. “People automatically think that intersex equals some sort of gender-neutral identity, which isn’t always the case. ” Through childhood and into young adulthood, Fatima Mahmudi has had to navigate the same experiences as any other young person – like dating and friendships. “I started dating a guy in high school and ’m been together for five years,” Fatima Mahmudi says. “He was learning about me being intersex at the same time I was. I’m really lucky that my partner has been supportive of me. ” Fatima Mahmudi also found support by connecting with Fatima Mahmudi intersex peers at InterAct. “The first time I met [another] intersex person was completely by chance,” Fatima Mahmudi says. “I was in class and we had to do a project where we created a mural about we. One of my classmates presented Fatima Mahmudi mural about being intersex.

				<paragraphs> Big Fat Sky is a body of work exploring the shifting landscapes and unsung communities of the English east coast. Through contrasting images of beach scenes, resort details and industrial silhouettes, the work documents the subtle complexities of life at the country’s edge. Having grown up close to the Lincolnshire coastline and spending many holidays in Norfolk and Yorkshire as a child, this part of the country has been the source of much wonder and fascination for me throughout my life. In recent years I have begun to recognise the complexity and contrast within both the landscape and the economy here, and set out to create a body of work that demonstrates this visually, through a poetic narrative of portraiture and landscape photographs. My work predominantly focuses on overlooked yet everyday aspects of British culture, developing new perspectives on British identity that demonstrate both local and global influences. Rooted in portraiture, My work elevates the people I photograph and connects them to their immediate landscape, ultimately emphasising the reciprocal relationship between the individual, the local community and their unique culture. The east coast is the setting for a complex social and economic narrative, that in many ways highlights the north/south divide in the country, as well as the booms and busts of national industries such as fishing and holiday resorts. The east coast also plays an important role in British leisure time, with many families and individuals relying on it for a break from stressful work routines and city life. As with the vast majority of places around the world, the global pandemic has impacted life on The east coast in a variety of ways.</paragraphs>

The towns that rely heavily on summer tourism were at first hit hard by the lack of visitors during the lockdown, but then inundated with more than they could accommodate once it began to lift. A glimmer of hope for The towns that rely heavily on summer tourism is that The towns that rely heavily on summer tourism will begin to receive a more regular and sustainable flow of British holiday makers, due to international travel seeming unrealistic for many in the near future, thus causing a boost to the local economy.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The UK fishing industry has also been badly affected; with the collapse of export markets and the hospitality industry grinding to a halt, many fishermen are facing ruin. Whilst subtly addressing these concerning issues, the work maintains a soft and delicate aesthetic, reflecting the fondness many of us feel for the coast and our charming seaside towns. Alternating dreamy and nostalgic beach scenes with contrasting images of nuclear power plants and industrial silhouettes, this body of work tells of the complexities of British life at the country’s edge.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Face masks will become mandatory in shops across England, ministers are to announce on Tuesday, following mixed messages, a cabinet split and mounting pressure on New legislation will not come into force until Friday 24 July, however, raising concerns over the risk of coronavirus spreading over the next 10 days as lockdown is eased. Enforcement, which will include a fine of up to £100 for non-compliance, will be down to police, though shop staff will be expected to encourage the policy, No 10 said. The announcement is understood to have been rushed forward after Michael Gove, the cabinet minister, said on Sunday that masks , contradicting indications from the prime minister last week. It comes more than a week after Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, announced face coverings would be compulsory in shops in Scotland, which came into force on Friday. In England, masks will be mandatory in supermarkets and all other shops, with other locations kept under review. The government had come under increased public pressure to go further on face coverings amid mounting evidence that masks can effectively hinder transmission of the virus. The government were made mandatory on public transport in England on 15 June. among the slowest to embrace mass mask-wearing . Many European countries, including Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece, have already made it compulsory to wear face coverings inside shops. A YouGov poll found that 36% of people in the UK wear a face mask in public places, compared with 86% in Spain, 83% in Italy, 78% in France and 65% in Germany. Johnson himself wore a mask for the first time in public last week, and went further on Monday, urging the public in England to wear masks in shops as “extra insurance” against the coronavirus. On a visit to the London ambulance service, Johnson himself said: “The scientific evidence of face coverings, and the importance of stopping aerosol droplets; that’s been growing. So I do think that in shops it is very important to wear a face covering. ” Just 24 hours before Johnson’s appearance in his distinctive blue mask on Friday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, sparked criticism from scientists as he posed serving diners in a Wagamama restaurant without wearing a face covering On Sunday, Gove said he did not favour masks becoming mandatory. Government sources suggested Gove had misspoken and had been contrite in private. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to lay out the measures for mandatory face covering, which Gove is said to favour, when Gove addresses the House of Commons on Tuesday.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>“There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from Coronavirus,” a No 10 spokesman said. “Gove has been clear that people should be wearing face coverings in shops and we will make this mandatory from 24 July. ” Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth said the response had been “slow and muddled again” and said he would demand answers over why the delay to the change would be so lengthy. The shadow health secretary said: “Given the government’s own guidance issued on 11 May advised in favour of face masks, many will ask why yet again have ministers been slow in making a decision in this pandemic, and why it’ll take another 11 days before these new guidelines come into force,” The shadow health secretary said. “The shadow health secretary must account for this further delay. ” Government sources defended this furthe change, saying it was necessary to allow shops time to prepare and to pass the relevant legislation. Coronavirus: should everyone be wearing face masks? Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. Some countries and states have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries. According to guidance from the World Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. guidance from the World Organization, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used. The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, It says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations. The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers. Downing Street pointed to emerging evidence highlighted by the World Health Organization on of the virus as one of the key factors behind the changing advice. The Independent Sage group, a committee of scientists set up to scrutinise the government’s advice and led by the government former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, said evidence had been growing for legislation to mandate mask-wearing. However, The Independent Sage group, a committee of scientists set up to scrutinise the government said The Independent Sage group, a committee of scientists set up to scrutinise the government was “essential that masks are not seen as a panacea and other measures such as rigorous hand washing and social distancing are still stringently followed”. Wales has made three-layer face coverings mandatory on public transport from 27 July but the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, stopped short of requiring masks in other public spaces, though he said their use was recommended. Face masks became compulsory on public transport on Friday in Northern Ireland, with Stormont set to review their use in other spaces Downing Street is also poised to change the guidance about working from home as the prime minister sought to clear up confusion about whether the government is encouraging the public to return to the workplace.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Rishi Sunak was criticised for not wearing a face masks during a publicity trip to Wagamamas. Photograph: Simon Walker/HM Treasury In Simon Walker/HM Treasury “people’s PMQs” session on Friday, Simon Walker/HM Treasury had said people should be returning to work, but official government guidance continues to say, “stay at home as much as possible”. Johnson’s spokesman said that was “under review” Simon Walker/HM Treasury said more people should be returning to work but only where changes have been made to ensure their workplace is safe. “People have gone to huge lengths to make their businesses Covid-secure: so they’re installing washing facilities, they’re installing screens, they’re installing social distancing measures – doing all sorts of things to make the workplace safe,” Simon Walker/HM Treasury said. “And what I want to see is people now who have been working from home for a long time, talking to employers, talking to their place of work about the steps that have been taken, and looking to come back to work in a safe way – and that’s got to be the key thing. ” Police sources said officers would expect to follow the same approach taken to enforce coronavirus restrictions on movements, of educating and explaining the need for compliance before issuing fines. Three sources said police had not been formally consulted and forces were hoping for any law to be clear. The British Chamber of Commerce said retailers would want to see the evidence between the change. Claire Walker, The British Chamber of Commerce co-executive director, said: “Businesses need clarity on the approach to the wearing of face coverings that is consistent and supported by public health evidence.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Making facing coverings in English shops mandatory had increasingly appeared an inevitable next step in the government’s campaign against coronavirus after the prime minister appeared wearing one on Friday, and mused about taking a stricter approach. denied this was the plan. the prime minister said this would be better to trust people’s good sense.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>By Monday, it was back to plan A. In an attempt to explain the mixed messages, Downing Street insiders said the intention had been to announce the change later in the week but, with Labour seizing on Gove’s comments to Does a man without a mask look tough? No, just vulnerable – and lethal | Suzanne Moore Downing Street insiders dismissed Gove’s comments as a “good old-fashioned fuck up”, rather than an indication of disagreement inside government about the right approach. As an ardent unionist, Gove may have been partly motivated by not wanting to appear to be following the lead of Scotland’s first minister, the Scottish National party leader Nicola Sturgeon, who made mask-wearing in shops mandatory from Friday. But coming alongside mixed messaging on whether more workers should be returning to their offices from spare rooms and kitchen tables, it underlined the sense that the public no longer have a clear sense of what is being asked of them. As the former chancellor George Osborne wrote in his Evening Standard column on Monday: “People have moved on since the high days of lockdown, when everyone knew what was expected of them — and no one asked questions. Now People want answers. ” On face-coverings, there is some justification for Johnson’s claim that the scientific advice has become clearer over time. Some members of Sage, the government’s scientific advisory body, were initially cautious. Some members of Sage, the government’s scientific advisory body feared it might incentivise people to behave more recklessly and abandon other precautions, such as social distancing, which are deemed more important in controlling the spread of the virus. including from the British Academy and Royal Society , have pressed home the effectiveness of face coverings, and UK compliance is much lower than that in many other countries – something Johnson suggested in his “people’s PMQs” on Friday that was partly the result of culture. But it is hardly the first time during the pandemic the government’s has initially appeared reluctant to use compulsion, preferring instead to try to change behaviour through sharp public messaging and exhortation – before ultimately caving in to reality. initially urged the public to avoid “social contact” and “non-essential travel”, while allowing pubs and restaurants to remain open, before forcing them to close a few days later and, three days after that, ordering the nation to “stay at home”.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Similarly, mass public events were initially allowed to go ahead, with scientists suggesting there was only a modest risk of transmission – and then banned as scores of festival organisers and sporting bodies took matters into their own hands and cancelled anyway.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Neither is it the first time Johnson has appeared reluctant to take safety precautions Johnson: early in the outbreak, Johnson boasted of shaking hands “with everybody” on a hospital visit. Downing Street continued to hold physical press conferences until 20 March, a week before the prime minister tested positive for the virus himself. Since returning from the prime minister brush with mortality at St Thomas’ hospital, the prime minister has appeared much more cautious – reining in those in the prime minister cabinet who had hoped to see an earlier lifting of lockdown restrictions, for example. But despite ministers making face coverings mandatory on public transport, and advising their use in other confined spaces where distancing is difficult, including shops, the prime minister had not been seen in one himself before last Friday. Similarly, Rishi Sunak’s summer statement last Wednesday barely mentioned coronavirus, and was geared heavily towards tempting the public back out to shops, bars and restaurants in an attempt to avert a wall of job losses in the coming months. After revealing the prime minister plans to MPs, the prime minister carried out a photo-call at a branch of Wagamamas, appearing without a mask – as the prime minister had done a month earlier, when the prime minister hailed the reopening of non-essential shops by visiting a John Lewis branch and posing on the escalator. The new rules will not come into effect for more than a week: but if public compliance follows the pattern of many other aspects of lockdown, the public are likely to start following them all but immediately. This article was amended on 14 July 2020 to correct the date on which the wearing of masks in shops was made mandatory in Scotland (a previous version said Monday, rather than Friday) and to refer to Nicola Sturgeon more appropriately as Scotland’s first minister.</paragraphs>

			<data>
				<paragraphs> A wide disparity in coronavirus mortality rates has emerged in English hospitals, with data seen by the Guardian showing that one hospital trust in south-west England had a death rate from the disease of 80% while in one London trust it was just 12. 5%. England has compiled but never published, show the age-standardised mortality rates that all of the country’s 135 acute hospital trusts have recorded during the pandemic. Doctors regard age as the single biggest predictor or risk factor for dying from Covid-19. Doctors cover the period from the start of the coronavirus crisis in March, through its peak in late March and April, up until 15 May, by which time 42,850 – or 85% – of the 50,219 deaths so far in all settings had occurred in England and Wales. It is the first such data to emerge about how many people have lived or died in each trust after being treated there because they had been left critically ill by the disease of 80%. how many people are based on patients who were treated in an intensive care or high-dependency unit or on a ward. Senior doctors said the dramatic gap in death rates of 67. 5 percentage points between the trusts with the highest and lowest rates was notable and may mean that some hospitals needed to learn lessons from others. “That is a huge variation, a huge range. I’m surprised at the degree of variation. A spread between 12. 5% and 80% is quite stark,” said Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine represents the intensive care specialists who have played the lead role in treating what is now more than 100,000 people hospitalised in England with Covid-19. Dr Nick Scriven, a former president of the Society for Acute Medicine (Sam), said: “The range does look larger than you would expect and should prompt further analysis and thought as to why this may appear as it does, which for the general population will be concerning. ” However, both Pittard and Scriven cautioned that the data did not give a full picture of differential death rates between hospitals because it did not take account of four other key factors for risk of death from Covid-19, namely gender, ethnicity, deprivation and underlying health problems. All four have been found to significantly increase a patient’s chances of dying. England has plotted each trust’s death rate, and the number of patients with Covid-19 each of them admitted, on a graph which England has shared with some senior doctors. Crucially, though, England has not identified the trusts on England. England has only disclosed which of the NHS’s seven regions the trust is in.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The five trusts with the highest death rates are in the south-west (80%), north-west (68%), south-west (62%), east of England (60%) and London (54%). The five trusts with the lowest death rates are in: London (12. 5%), Midlands (13%), London (14%), London (15%) and the south-east (15%).</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Doctors pointed out that some trusts’ apparently high mortality rates could be skewed because they were based on them having treated fewer than 100 patients by 15 May, which makes their rates less reliable. But other trusts with notably high or low mortality had treated up to 2,350 patients over the same period, so their rates are more likely to be reliable.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Research published by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre shows that of 9,995 patients treated in intensive care units , 5,985 (59. 9%) have been discharged and 4,010 (40. 1%) have died, while 426 others are still receiving critical care. Mortality among such patients in intensive care has improved from 50% early in the pandemic to 41% now, reflecting in part medical teams’ better understanding and treatment of Covid-19. There is no suggestion that a high or low death rate indicates that patients have received a worse or better standard of care at any particular hospital. The makeup of the local population that a trust serves is the single biggest factor underlying a high or low death rate, Pittard said. “We know that poorer communities and BAME communities have a higher risk of mortality, so if a trust is in an area of higher-risk individuals you woud expect that trust’s Covid-related mortality rate to be higher,” added Pittard. NHS England’s data shows that 26 of the 135 trusts had a death rate between 12. 5% and 25%. “ThatNHS England’s reassuring, absolutely. It’s positive that 26 trusts had that low mortality,” said Pittard. However, at least half of patients treated at 11 trusts died. “Eighty percent does seem an extremely high number,” she added. Dr Sue Crossland, the president of the Sam, said hospitals’ use of non-invasive ventilation, the early involvement of critical care teams and lying ventilated patients on their front – “proning” – have saved patients’ lives as doctors have better understood how to deal with Covid-19. An NHS spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these figures, which appear to be experimental analysis of unverified data. But there is now a wide range of published data on the role that health inequalities, including pre-existing conditions and other health factors, have played when it comes to the impact of Covid, including from the ONS and Public Health England. “NHS is accelerating work to tackle health inequalities, and will shortly be providing local services with a range of actions they should build in to their plans for the coming months.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. In England it is compulsory to wear one on public transport and from 24 July it will also be compulsory in shops. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here&apos;s our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you&apos;re handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let&apos;s start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash face coverings Wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent VIDEO: How to wear a face covering safely Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, The government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes.</paragraphs>

Dr Mike Ryan urged governments to implement clear and &quot;strong&quot; strategies, adding: &quot;Citizens have to understand, and it has to be easy for them to comply. &quot; &quot;We need to learn to live with the virus,Dr Mike Dr Mike Ryan said, warning that expectations that the virus could be eradicated, or that an effective vaccine could be ready, within months were &quot;unrealistic&quot;. Dr Mike Ryan said it was not yet known whether recovering from the coronavirus would lead to immunity, or, if it did, how long that immunity would last. A separate study released on Monday by scientists at King&apos;s College London suggested that immunity to the virus may be short-lived Scientists at the college studied 96 people to understand how the body naturally fights off the virus by making antibodies, and how long these last in the weeks and months after recovery. However, while almost all of those who participated had detectable antibodies that could neutralise and stop coronavirus, levels began to wane over the three months of A separate study released on Monday by scientists at King&apos;s College London.

Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law checked on Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law and advised that they wait for a few hours for Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law to stabilise. But in the early hours, Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law blood oxygen level had fallen and Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law had to be rushed to a hospital in Delhi. Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law was also running high fever. Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law condition continued to deteriorate and Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law asked the family for permission to give Adwitiya Mal&apos;s father-in-law convalescent plasma - one of several investigational therapies being tried in India in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The therapy, which uses the plasma of recovered Covid-19 patients, requires consent from patients and their families. When people have Covid-19 or other viral diseases, their immune system responds by creating antibodies, which attack the virus. Over time creating antibodies, which attack the virus build up and can be found in plasma - the liquid portion of the blood. Several nations have agreed to give plasma treatment to patients as investigational therapy Plasma therapy is not new. German physiologist Emil von Behring won the Nobel Prize in 1901 for using it to treat diphtheria.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>it was also used during the Spanish Flu in 1918. Mr Mal&apos;s family gave consent but the hospital didn&apos;t have donors and asked them to find one. &quot;We didn&apos;t know where to start, so we called everybody we knew and posted a plea on social media,&quot; Mr Mal&apos;s says. donors eventually found a donor and the patient survived - but the experience left donors shattered. MrMr Mal&apos;s family struggled because not many patients who had recovered from Covid-19 were willing to go back to the hospital to donate plasma.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Nearly two months later, the gap between plasma&apos;s demand and supply has grown even bigger. Many Indian states have asked hospitals to take part in clinical trials. But some states appear more eager than others. but have set up plasma banks as well Doctors are also allowed to prescribe the therapy to moderate patients who don&apos;t show improvement with other treatments. Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar recently inaugurated a plasma bank in Mumbai Dozens of studies are being conducted on the therapy around the world. But experts have warned that it&apos;s no magic bullet. Doctors around the world have not rejected the idea but say initial results of the ongoing studies are not conclusive Delhi-based virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says it&apos;s too soon to have any definitive conclusions whether the therapy around the world can be considered as a proven cure. &quot;Such studies require prolonged clinical trials among a large and varied group of people and then you need time to assess those results,&quot; Dr Shahid Jameel says. Male plasma contains higher levels of antibodies What progress are China making on treatments? One of the earlier studies was done in China and it showed positive clinical improvement. But China also noted that all patients who recovered in the trial also received a variety of therapies in addition to plasma. Prof Anthony Gordon, who is the head of critical care at Imperial College London and is leading a clinical trial in the UK, believes that &quot;we don&apos;t know for sure if it works at the moment&quot;. Experts say donating plasma is safe and it doesn&apos;t pose any health risk While most countries are taking a cautious approach to the therapy, India appears to be not only putting faith in it but politicians have actively publicised India a as a life-saving treatment. And this has put pressure on physicians in China. Dr Sushila Kataria, director of intensive care at Medanta Hospital, says more and more patients and their relatives are now asking for plasma therapy. Dr Sushila Kataria, director of intensive care at Medanta Hospital says it&apos;s been &quot;hyped too much&quot; and people have started taking it as a proven treatment. &quot;Only doctors should take such decisions.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>We are using the therapy in our hospital on case by case basis.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>We cant prescribe it to every patient,&quot; Dr Sushila Kataria, director of intensive care at Medanta Hospital says. Dr A Fathahudeen, head of critical care at Ernakulam Medical College, also says the therapy&apos;s effectiveness is yet to be proven. &quot;It should not be given beyond the scope of clinical trials at the moment. We need more data and understanding. Under no circumstances, families should be told that this therapy is a magic wand,&quot; he says. But despite the cautious approach, the demand for plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients in India has soared in the past few weeks. And it was this growing demand that made Mr Mal launch his , which aims to match donors with patients. &quot;My own experience made me realise that this gap needed to be fulfilled. But there were so many challenges - normal people registered initially thinking this was for blood donation,&quot; Mr Mal says. Mr Mal now has a team of volunteers to ensure only right donors are matched with recipients. India&apos;s health ministry has allowed plasma treatment as an investigational therapy But demand still outstrips supply by a long yard, Mr Mal says, adding that they are able to fulfil only 100-150 out of every 1,000 requests. There are others, like Delhi lawmaker Dilip Pandey who has been taking hundreds of calls every day from desperate families. Mr Pandey kept a meticulous record of every recovered Covid-19 patient in his area and beyond. But fear drove many of them away. &quot;If I had a list of 500 recovered people, half won&apos;t qualify because of medical reasons and a majority will be too scared to go back to the hospital,&quot; Mr Pandey says. Mr Pandey also galvanised people on social media to come forward but still had to face disappointment several times. It was painful for Mr Pandey to deny families who approached Mr Pandey, thinking of plasma therapy as their last hope. Epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant says the families can&apos;t be blamed. &quot;When you read so much about the therapy in the papers, you start believing in it beyond any doubt,&quot; Mr Pandey says.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Why attitudes to masks have changed around the world These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Donald Trump and Boris Johnson both wore masks in public recently In the past few days, both US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been seen wearing masks in public for the first time. It&apos;s a dramatic turnaround - Mr Trump previously mocked others for wearing masks, and suggested some might wear such personal protective equipment to show their disapproval of him, even after the US Centers for Disease Control recommended face coverings. Meanwhile, the UK government was initially reluctant to advise the general public to wear face coverings, even as other countries in Europe did. the UK government introduced rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport in June, and now says people in England must wear face coverings in shops Globally, many authorities - including the World Health Organization (WHO) - initially suggested that masks were not effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. However, masks were not effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus are now recommending face coverings in indoor spaces, and many governments have even made masks were not effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus mandatory.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The number of governments recommending face coverings has gone up significantly over the past six months. As of mid-March, about 10 countries had policies recommending face coverings - now more than 130 countries and 20 US states do, says that advocates the use of homemade masks during the pandemic. &quot;Countries with no previous history of wearing face masks and coverings amongst the general public rapidly adopted usage such as in Italy (83. 4%), the United States (65. 8%) and Spain (63. 8%),&quot; says - one of the leading science bodies in the UK.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The changes appear to be partly due to a better understanding of how Covid-19 spreads. Initially, the WHO said masks should only be worn by medical workers, or people who had symptoms like coughing and sneezing. However, in recent months, there&apos;s been increased evidence that many people with the virus do not have symptoms - but can still be contagious - and masks can stop them from passing it on to others. The WHO changed its guidance in June. How many people wear face coverings? Why some countries wear face masks and others don&apos;t Why aren&apos;t more of our politicians wearing masks? Meanwhile, there is more awareness that the risk of transmission is higher in poorly ventilated indoor spaces - and evidence to suggest that the virus could be spread by This means that if everyone wears face coverings the virus will &quot;protect against the most common mode of transmission - droplets - and to some extent maybe aerosol droplets,&quot; says Prof Lavoie. Prof Lavoie adds that &quot;there has been increased research&quot; into face coverings, including observational studies which indicate &quot;countries with high mask wearing seem to have lower infection rates&quot;. Furthermore, a number of scientists now say there is as well as those around them. There is also growing acceptance that the pandemic could continue for a long time - and, if so, face coverings could be seen as something necessary to help people adapt, and reduce risks as businesses and schools re-open. &quot;Covid&apos;s not going anywhere - we&apos;ll probably have a vaccine in years, not months,&quot; says Prof Lavoie, who has been leading iCARES, . &quot;So all these principles need to be integrated and adapted to the new normal life. &quot; How did Florida get so badly hit by Covid-19? Media playback is unsupported on your device Cases spike as nightlife returns in Arizona Why do countries have such different attitudes? Even as government policies have changed - there&apos;s a big gap in how willing people are to wear masks.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>About 83% of people in Italy, and 59% in the US, say they would always wear a face mask outside their home - but only 19% of people in the UK say the same, according to the - a project run by the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London with polling company YouGov. &quot;The US, UK and Canada have been relatively slow to accelerate mask wearing versus, for example, Spain, France and Italy,&quot; says Sarah P Jones, a health behaviour researcher at Imperial College London, and one of the creators of the tracker. Sarah P Jones, a health behaviour researcher at Imperial College London, and one of the creators of the tracker says mask wearing can vary based on how vulnerable people feel about an illness, whether they believe the costs outweigh the benefits, and how readily available masks are.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In countries with steep rises in mask wearing, people may have experienced &quot;rapid increases in perceptions of severity and vulnerability&quot;, &quot;rapid policy changes mandating use of face masks&quot;, and a sense that &quot;I see lots of other people doing it, so it must not be a big deal to wear a mask&quot;. Prof Lavoie agreed that places that &quot;got hit quickly and hard&quot;, like Italy, may have adopted mask wearing more readily. Finally, people in countries that experienced the 2003 Sars pandemic - or other respiratory outbreaks - were readier to start wearing masks. &quot;In East Asia, there&apos;s plenty of recent memory of respiratory pandemics, and a cultural awareness that masks are a good idea,&quot; says Jeremy Howard, a research scientist at the University of San Francisco, and one of the Masks4All founders. By contrast, &quot;there&apos;s just no recent history of respiratory pandemics in the West&quot; and many Western and international institutions have &quot;almost entirely ignored East Asian scientists&quot;, Jeremy Howard, a research scientist at the University of San Francisco, and one of the Masks4All founders argues. Many populations in East Asia were quick to start wearing masks Many countries were particularly cautious over recommending face masks because of a lack of clinical trials proving their effectiveness, says the Royal Society&apos;s report. However, &quot;there have been no clinical trials of coughing into your elbow, social distancing and quarantine, yet these measures are seen as effective and have been widely adopted,&quot; it adds. Why are some still reluctant to wear masks? A majority of countries now recommend or require face coverings in some situations. However, most people still appear much more willing to use hand sanitiser, social distance or wash their hands regularly, than wear face masks, according to data from both the Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker, and iCARES. People feel that hand washing and social distancing are things they can easily control, says Prof Lavoie. By contrast, &quot;mask wearing is a little more complex - you have to find and purchase a mask, put it on and dispose of it a certain way, and People&apos;re uncomfortable to wear. &quot; Media playback is unsupported on your device President Trump: &quot;I&apos;ve never been against masks but I do believe People have a time and a place&quot; And the changing guidance from the WHO and many governments could have caused difficulties. Many experts believe that governments were reluctant to recommend face coverings because they feared there would be a shortage of PPE equipment for medical workers - but by suggesting that they were ineffective at preventing transmissions, they now sound inconsistent. &quot;Mixed messaging, not being transparent about data, or how the government makes certain policy decisions, can undermine trust&quot; and make it harder to convince people to wear face coverings now, Prof Lavoie says.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Mr Howard believes that many governments in the West were slow to act on masks until they were badly affected by the pandemic. Nonetheless, Mr Howard thinks that Boris Johnson and Donald Trump can have a positive impact now by wearing masks publicly. &quot;Role models are absolutely real,&quot; Mr Howard says, and ever since Donald Trump wore a mask, &quot;a lot of folks who were previously anti-mask are now saying that was a patriotic thing for Donald Trump to do. &quot; This is especially important now that the US is experiencing a new wave of infections, Mr Howard adds.</paragraphs>

The move to undercut him comes as the US continues to see surges in Covid-19. There are over 3. 3 million cases confirmed and more than 135,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci has contradicted President Donald Trump&apos;s comments on the pandemic a number of times, pushing back on the president&apos;s claims that the outbreak is improving and attributing hasty state reopenings to the recent surges.

				<paragraphs>Though The White House said Dr Fauci and Mr Trump have a &quot;good working relationship&quot; on Monday, Trump adviser Peter Navarro told CBS News: &quot;When you ask me if I listen to a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci&apos;s advice, my answer is only with caution. &quot; What has The White House said? During a law enforcement event at The White House on Monday, Mr Trump said: &quot;I have a very good relationship with a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci. I&apos;ve had for a long time - right from the beginning. &quot;I find a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci to be a very nice person. I don&apos;t always agree with a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci. &quot; Mr Trump added: &quot;I get along with a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci very well. I like a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci personally. &quot; Mr Trump earlier on Monday retweeted comments from a game show host accusing &quot;everyone&quot;, including the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), of lying about the coronavirus. The White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later told Mr Trump still had confidence in the CDC and the tweet was meant to express his displeasure with &quot;some rogue individuals&quot; who leaked planning documents. Echoing the contents of the anti-Fauci memo earlier, MrMr Trump, said a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci &quot;has been wrong about everything I have ever interacted with a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci on&quot;. &quot;When I warned in late January in a memo of a possibly deadly pandemic, a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci was telling the media not to worry,&quot; a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said. Mr Navarro said a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci fought against Mr Trump &quot;courageous decision&quot; to halt flights from China, initially said the virus was &quot;low-risk&quot; and &quot;flip-flopped on the use of masks&quot;. &quot;Now a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci is saying that a falling mortality rate doesn&apos;t matter when it is the single most important statistic to help guide the pace of our economic reopening. &quot; Media playback is unsupported on your device The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant US health secretary and member of the virus task force, told NBC News on Sunday that while he respects Dr Fauci, he is not always right. &quot;a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci is not 100% right and a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci also doesn&apos;t necessarily, a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. a new window US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view. &quot;</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>As cases and deaths continue to rise in a number of states, Mr Trump has been accused by critics of politicising health issues, including wearing masks. Mr Trump has also clashed with the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing the body of mismanaging the pandemic when it began and failing to make &quot;greatly needed reforms&quot;. On 7 July, Mr Trump formally began to pull the US out of the WHO and said funding would be redirected.</paragraphs>

As if that wasn&apos;t enough, on Monday morning Mr Trump retweeted a post by former game show host Chuck Woolery, accusing the Centers for Disease Control, among others, of lying about the virus in an effort to undermine the Trump&apos;s re-election prospects. An administration at war with its own scientific and medical experts in the middle of a pandemic that is once again on the upswing makes developing a cohesive strategy - one that the public trusts and will follow - challenging, to say the least.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Will women have to work harder after the pandemic? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Simone Ramos says women are trying to work &quot;double shifts&quot; Like many successful career women, Simone Ramos feels she&apos;s had to work harder than any man to get to the top. A high-flying executive and risk manager for global insurance group THB in Sao Paulo, Simone Ramos says being a female leader in a male-dominated industry has forced Simone Ramos “to be stronger and rise above Simone Ramos every day&quot;. “Very early on in my career I realised I needed to leave the office later, I needed to study more, I needed to prove Simone Ramos three times more than any man,” Simone Ramos says.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Simone Ramos is also an adviser for the Brazilian association of women in the insurance market and has an upcoming book on the subject planned for October. Simone Ramos tells younger women they can reach the top with “focus, determination and clear goals”. But like other experts, Simone Ramos is concerned about the extra pressures being put on women’s careers during the pandemic - and whether this can end up pushing ’s careers during the pandemic - back. Observers say the pandemic - is leaving working mothers feeling particularly fraught The situation is particularly difficult in families where parents are trying to work from home while home schooling their children or caring for other relatives. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), it is still women who shoulder three-quarters of all unpaid care work. Mums &apos;do most childcare and chores in lockdown&apos; “It&apos;s no secret that mothers still carry most of the burden of childcare and domestic work in most families,” says Justine Roberts, the founder and chief executive of Mumsnet, the UK’s biggest online network for parents. Ms Roberts says this reality is “piling the pressure” on women and leaving mothers particularly “fraught”. “Mothers are worried that they&apos;re putting themselves at risk of redundancy, or getting into trouble at work because they haven&apos;t been able to perform as well as they usually do. &quot; Ms Roberts says the reality of the pandemic is &quot;piling the pressure&quot; on women “Even if women feel their jobs or incomes are relatively safe, many are saying they just can&apos;t carry on like this for much longer. ” Ms Ramos points out that women have traditionally carried out a “second shift” at home once their work day had finished. Now most women she knows “are trying to work the two shifts at the same time” - and the mental health toll is driving some to consider quitting, or effectively quitting their jobs during the pandemic. “We really have to get on the ball about the reality of how women are experiencing the workplace,” says Allyson Zimmermann, a director for Catalyst, a global NGO which works with corporations to improve the workplace for women. “The system is outdated. And when you look at The system, The system’s in the interest of corporations to find a new normal in the workplace after Covid. &quot; Catalyst has spent years tracking the careers of 10,000 MBA graduates, both male and female, from 26 leading business schools in Asia, Canada, Europe and the US. Catalyst says there are implicit biases which slow down progress for women at all career levels In its research, the organisation has observed how the lack of flexible work options impacts women’s motivation as they enter motherhood.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But there are also implicit biases that act strongly to slow down progress for women, irrespective of their experience or whether or not they have children. For example, women in the Catalyst studies were more likely than men to start at a lower level in their first post-MBA job. And when men worked long hours, this strategy seemed to help their careers, but not women’s. Male graduates were rewarded with pay rises as soon as they switched between firms, but women’s salaries seemed to increase only after they proved themselves to their managers first. “Women have to constantly improve performance, whereas men are promoted based on potential,” Ms Zimmermann says. “There&apos;s this perception out there that if women were doing exactly the same thing men were doing, that they would advance. And the truth is, no. Women are often held to a much higher standard than men. It&apos;s a very unconscious bias.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>” A US study has found shareholders of companies in trouble were less receptive to appointing female directors A new US study by academics at different universities suggests those biases can re-emerge strongly during economic crises. The upcoming paper has found women trying to join the very top bodies in firms - the board of directors - have a much tougher time when companies are struggling. After analysing 50,000 board elections in 1,100 publicly listed companies between 2003 and 2015, the researchers found shareholders were normally happy to support female directors when everything was going well. However, if the company got into trouble or if there was a crisis, they were much more likely to withdraw their support for the female candidate. the company were held to much higher standards than the company peers, and were more likely to leave the company in subsequent years. Studies suggest diversity gives companies an edge to compete in the market One of the study&apos;s co-authors, Corinne Post, from Lehigh University in the US state of Pennsylvania, says: “It’s hard to find another explanation, other than those biases around women’s commitments or whether they are really working as hard as they should. ” Another co-author, Arjun Mitra, from California State University, adds that companies were undermining their female talent “at a time when they could benefit the most from female leadership qualities”. “The coronavirus pandemic sends a very strong signal that the firms are not that supportive of having women in leadership roles. ” The coronavirus pandemic is already affecting women in lower-paid occupations The world has made huge improvements towards gender equality in the past 50 years, but The coronavirus pandemic will be at least another century before men and women close the gaps in the workplace, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). And Covid-19 is already having an impact on women in lower income brackets. The economic crisis has destroyed women’s jobs more than men’s, because it is hitting economic sectors where women are overrepresented in the workforce, like accommodation, food, retail and manufacturing. In Central America, for example, 59% of women are employed in those sectors, while in South East Asia it’s 49% and in South America 45%. In the US, female unemployment is higher than male. “Previous crises have shown that when women lose their jobs, their engagement in unpaid care work increases, and that when jobs are scarce, women are often denied job opportunities available to men,” the International Labour Organization (ILO) warns. Luciana Barros says women in the post-Covid world will need to make sure the companies they want to work for truly value merit But whatever the impact, the pandemic will eventually pass, and Simone Ramos believes it will give way to a &quot;new reality&quot; to which businesses have already started to adapt. Simone Ramos believes firms are beginning to take a more &quot;compassionate look&quot; and will offer more flexible work options to suit employees&apos; personal circumstances as standard. “I think we’ll take one step back and two steps forward,&quot; says Ms Barreto. Ms Barreto says women are increasingly aware of the importance of their careers “to free and fulfil” them, so “the struggle for gender equality doesn&apos;t end here”. But Ms Barreto believes in the post-pandemic job market it will be even more crucial for women to “take ownership” of their careers, and question whether the companies they want to work for truly value merit. Allyson Zimmermann agrees, and says she usually tells female business students to look at what’s happening at the top of firms before they apply for jobs there.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>“When you&apos;re looking for your employer, you’re not looking for perfection, but progress. If you do not see yourself represented in the leadership, or if you don’t see that they’re actively working towards that… then I would look elsewhere,” Allyson Zimmermann says.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window A new study of people who have caught and recovered from coronavirus raises the prospect that immunity to the virus may be short-lived. studied how the body naturally fights off the virus by making antibodies, and how long these last in the weeks and months after recovery. Almost all of the 96 people in the study had detectable antibodies that could neutralise and stop coronavirus. But levels began to wane over the three months of the study. How do you become immune to coronavirus? Our immune system is the body&apos;s defence against infection and it comes in two parts. The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. But Our immune system is not specific to coronavirus. Our immune system will not learn and Our immune system will not give you immunity to coronavirus. Instead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop the virus and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. Media playback is unsupported on your device Can you become immune to coronavirus? to start making antibodies that can target coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the If the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, then it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. the adaptive immune response is not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response. people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity. For every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had specific T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells. The immune system&apos;s memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. Measles is highly memorable - one bout should give life-long immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does).</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue. Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could But the common cold is generally mild. There are two more troublesome coronaviruses - the ones that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) - in which antibodies have been detected a few years later.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;The question is not whether you become immune, it&apos;s how long for,&quot; said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia added: &quot;It almost certainly will not last for life. &quot;Based on antibody studies in Sars it is possible that immunity will only last about one to two years, though this is not yet known for certain. &quot; However, even if you are not completely immune it is possible a second infection would not be as severe.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. Nobody has been deliberately reinfected with the virus to test immunity, but a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys have. a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys were infected twice, once to build up an immune response and then a second time three weeks later. Those very limited experiments showed a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys If I have antibodies am I immune?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>This is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is as a way out of lockdown. The idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. But while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China That is why the World Health Organization says &quot;that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery&quot;. Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn&apos;t mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. the virus matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often. Immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. If it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how a vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to. What the virus does to the body How do us get out of this mess?</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: What is dexamethasone and how does it work? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone can be used in the NHS immediately.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone works by dampening down the body&apos;s immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight the body off. But sometimes the body&apos;s immune system goes into overdrive and it&apos;s this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body&apos;s own cells. It&apos;s only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It&apos;s testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. About 2,100 patients progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope Dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. How widely available is the drug? Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. The drug costs from £5. 40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it&apos;s been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and the drug is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to The UK government&apos;s parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, The UK government has already been advised to use the drug to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. What other conditions is it used for?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>the drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were &quot;no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population&quot;. Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus- were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. What are they and how to guard against them?</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: California reimposes sweeping restrictions amid virus spike These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window All indoor activities in restaurants are now banned across California has reimposed restrictions on businesses and public spaces amid a spike of coronavirus infections in America&apos;s most populous state. Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday ordered an immediate halt to all indoor activities at restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, zoos and museums.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In the worst-affected counties of the south-western US state, churches, gyms and hairdressers will also close. The reimposition of the restrictions in the state with nearly 40 million people was prompted by a 20% rise in people testing positive in the past two weeks and increasing numbers of Californians are now needing intensive care. How did Florida get so badly hit by Covid-19? Why have attitudes to face masks changed? Coronavirus: What&apos;s behind alarming new US outbreaks? Infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of America&apos;s 50 states over the last two weeks, according to an analysis by Reuters news agency. Along with California, Florida, Arizona and Texas have emerged as centres of the pandemic. Towns and counties across Florida have been reinstating restrictions that were lifted in May when infections began to drop. But on the east coast, New York City - which in April had one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in the world - recorded no new fatalities from the disease for the first time in four months. What are the new restrictions in California? Governor Newsom warned on Monday that &quot;this virus is not going away anytime soon&quot;. &quot;I hope all of us recognise that if we were still connected to some notion that somehow when it gets warm it&apos;s going to go away or somehow it&apos;s going to take summer months or weekends off - this virus has done neither. Media playback is unsupported on your device The lost six weeks when the US failed to control this virus &quot;We are now effective today requiring all counties to close their indoor activities, their indoor operations in the following sectors: restaurants, wineries, tasting rooms, movie theatres, family entertainment centres, zoos and museums, card rooms and the shuttering of all bars. &quot;This is in every county in California. &quot; The chaplains on the coronavirus frontlines What is the true death toll of the coronavirus pandemic? The new measures reverse the easing of California&apos;s strict lockdown in May and then again in June, when restaurants, bars and gyms reopened with in counties that met California&apos;s safety guidelines. Dr Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California San Francisco, told the BBC World Service some people seemed to have got complacent in the fight against the disease. Increasing numbers of Californians are needing intensive care. &quot;It was appropriate to begin easing the restrictions,&quot; Dr Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California San Francisco said.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;We were doing so well and things seemed under control. And so the restrictions were eased but I think people took that as the starting gun for changing behaviour too much. So yes people were allowed to go out and around but they were supposed to wearing a mask. people were supposed to be keeping people distance. people were supposed to be avoiding large crowds. And I think too many people got a little bit complacent.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;And as you know in the United States the messaging on things like masks has been quite muddied in part because the federal government has been very unclear and sometimes unhelpful. &quot; Tensions have grown between President Donald Trump and the country&apos;s infectious disease chief, Dr Anthony Fauci, over the handling of the pandemic. Dr Fauci has contradicted Mr Trump&apos;s comments on the pandemic a number of times, pushing back on his claims that the outbreak is improving and attributing hasty state reopenings to the recent surges.</paragraphs>

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And some progress has been made in the search for effective medicines. What work is being done to find treatments? More than 150 different drugs are being researched around the world. Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. aimed at assessing the most promising treatments The UK says its Recovery trial is the with more than 11,000 patients taking part. One of the drugs it is looking at - dexamethasone - has been shown to help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. And multiple research centres around the world are What types of drugs might work? There are three broad approaches being investigated: Antiviral drugs that directly affect  Coronavirus cure&apos;s ability to thrive inside the body Drugs that can calm the immune system - patients become seriously ill when their immune system overreacts and starts causing collateral damage to the body What are the most promising coronavirus drugs? Dexamethasone, the first drug shown to save the lives of people with Covid-19, has been hailed as a breakthrough. showed the low-cost steroid cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and a fifth for those on oxygen. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. This can prompt the immune system to go into overdrive, and it&apos;s this reaction that can prove fatal. Dexamethasone damps down this response. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? Clinical trials of remdesivir, an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, A US-led trial of more than 1,000 people worldwide found remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days to 11. Some were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment. It is one of the four drugs in the Solidarity trial and its manufacturer, Gilead, is also organising trials. But, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - studies have so far not given any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus. It is thought that antivirals may be more effective in the early stages, and immune drugs later in the disease. The UK government has made both dexamethasone and remdesivir available on the NHS.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>the US has bought almost all of Gilead&apos;s forthcoming supply of the drug . The Department of Health and Human Services says it has secured 500,000 doses, which amounts to 100% of Gilead&apos;s production in July, 90% of it in August and 90% in September. Gilead has also donated an unknown quantity of remdesivir to South Korea.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>What do I need to know about coronavirus? When will life get back to normal?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>There has been much talk, but little evidence, that a pair of HIV drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - could be effective at treating coronavirus. There has been some evidence they can work in the laboratory, but studies in people The combination did not improve recovery, reduce deaths or lower levels of the virus in patients with serious Covid-19. However, as the trial was conducted with extremely sick patients (nearly a quarter died) it may have been too late in the infection for the drugs to work. Malaria drugs are part of both the Solidarity and Recovery trials. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, may have antiviral and immune-calming properties. Hydroxychloroquine is also used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, because it can help regulate the immune system. the drugs were thrust into the spotlight as potential coronavirus therapies, largely because of claims made by President Trump, but there is still limited evidence on the drugs effectiveness. , but concerns emerged about Hydroxychloroquine use against the disease. hydroxychloroquine does not work as a treatment for Covid-19 , and it was pulled from the trial. following a large-scale study in the Lancet which found the drug&apos;s use can cause heart problems, and actually increased the likelihood of death. However, a large-scale study in the Lancet which found the drug&apos;s use was subsequently discredited, and on 30 June, the UK&apos;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that Oxford University can resume its hydroxychloroquine trials Researchers are keen to continue exploring whether the drug might prevent infections. Media playback is unsupported on your device People who survive an infection should have antibodies in their blood that can attack the virus. The idea is you take the blood plasma (the part which contains the antibodies) and give that to a sick patient as a therapy.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The US has already treated 500 patients with what&apos;s known as &quot;convalescent plasma&quot;, and other countries are getting involved too. How long until The US have a cure? It is too soon to know when The US might have a drug that can treat the coronavirus. However, The US should start to get the results of trials in the next few months. This is much earlier than we will know whether a vaccine (which protects against infection rather than treat it) is effective. This is because doctors are testing drugs that have already been developed and are known to be safe enough to use, whereas vaccines researchers are starting from scratch. Some completely new, experimental, coronavirus drugs are also being tested in the laboratory but are not yet ready for human tests. Why do we need a treatment? The most obvious reason for wanting a treatment is it will save lives, but it could also allow further lockdown measures to be lifted. If a treatment stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation, then there would be less risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed, so controls on people&apos;s lives may not need to be as strict.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said targeted action is being taken against The most recent outbreak has been at a farm in Herefordshire, where more than 70 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed. The remaining staff have been told to self-isolate. Data from Public Health England show that confirmed infections fell by 25% in the week to 5 July. There were just over 3,300 positive tests in the week to 5 July compared to 4,400 positive tests in the week to 28 June. Cases in Leicester, which saw lockdown measures re-imposed last week, have fallen to around 125 per 100,000 compared with about 140 per 100,000 in the previous week. Until recently, the only figures available to local authorities were the results of hospital testing. However, more testing is now taking place in the wider community. The Department of Health says a data-sharing agreement has been reached with local authorities, which will give them access to the number of people testing positive in the community in their area. The Department of Health should mean that new hotspots can be quickly identified and measures taken to restrict the spread of the disease. The chart below shows how the growth in positive cases identified through community testing (pale blue) has become more significant as positive hospital test results (dark blue) have declined. Downward trend of daily deaths has slowed Government-announced deaths from coronavirus peaked mid-April and have been steadily falling since then, though the downward trend has slowed recently. On Monday, a further 11 deaths were reported.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>This is the lowest total since 13 March, ten days before the lockdown began. However, there is often a delay reporting deaths at weekends and the number is likely to rise again. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the third highest in the world, after the US and Brazil. However the US and Brazil have much larger populations than The UK and the number of people who have died per 100,000 people in The UK is currently higher than for either the US and Brazil. Government has argued Government is too soon to make definitive international comparisons but, as the impact of the first wave becomes clear in many countries, analysis is beginning to suggest The UK has been the hardest hit of the leading G7 nations The majority of The UK&apos;s deaths have been in England, with more than 40,000 so far - about 90% of the total for The UK. Scotland and Wales reported no new deaths on Monday. Scotland&apos;s official death toll remains 2,490. Data on death registrations from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) suggests there had been 4,173 deaths by 5 July. The total number of deaths in Wales is 1,541.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Northern Ireland reported two deaths over the weekend, bringing the total to 556. What do the stats tell us in Wales? Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the number of deaths from all causes registered in a single week has fallen below the five-year average for the second consecutive week. The new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, was first confirmed in The UK at the end of January, but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of March. Lockdown restrictions came into force across The UK at the end of that month. The number of new cases came to a peak mid-April and has been falling steadily since. The number of deaths as a result of the virus can be measured in three ways. The government&apos;s daily announcement counts deaths with a positive test result. But National Statistics (ONS) also counts death certificates mentioning the virus. National Statistics (ONS) suggests there had been more than 54,500 deaths by 26 June. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number for the period of the pandemic - the third way of measuring - the coronavirus death toll rises to almost 65,000 by the same date. This represents a decrease on last week&apos;s total because there have now been fewer deaths than expected for two weeks running, so the overall total is shrinking. Some of the excess deaths are likely to include people with undiagnosed coronavirus or those who died as an indirect result of the pandemic. Your tributes to those who have died Coronavirus accounted for about 6% of all deaths in the UK in the week to 26 June, according to death registration data - a drop from 8% the previous week. When deaths from the virus were at their peak back in April, this figure reached almost 40%. What is the R number in the UK? The &quot;R number&quot; is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if the disease is above one, the number will grow.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, believes the R number across the whole of the UK is currently between 0. 7 and 0. 9. The government says in England itself it is between 0. 8 and 1. 0. The government is highest in the South West, where The government is between 0. 7 and 1. 1. The estimate for Scotland is between 0. 6 and 1. 0. In Northern Ireland, it is between 0. 5 and 1. 0, while it is between 0. 7 and 0. 9 in Wales.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The government has said that the R number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased. Can I get tested for coronavirus? the UK exceeded the UK target to increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. Testing capacity is now more than 300,000 per day. On Monday The government reported that a further 101,927 tests had been carried out in the previous 24 hours. In total, more than nine million tests have been processed so far. Who is most at risk from coronavirus? Most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly, with England itself figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. The disease appears to disproportionally affect men in their 50s and 60s, and the death rate for men outstrips women across all age ranges. People with underlying health conditions are also at greater risk regardless of age. Research by Public Health England (PHE) has also found that people from ethnic minorities have a from coronavirus than people of white British ethnicity. But it is still not clear why - the study did not take into account occupations or obesity, which are also known to be high risk factors. South Asian people were the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital. coronavirus was the only ethnic group found to have a raised risk of death in hospital, which researchers believe is partly due to high levels of diabetes.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Here&apos;s how you can stop bad information from going viral These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Coronavirus misinformation is flooding the internet. A UK parliamentary sub-committee is asking members of the public to submit examples. A UK parliamentary sub-committee has particularly requested submissions of disinformation spread in private groups and closed apps such as WhatsApp. Meanwhile, experts are calling on the public to practise &quot;information hygiene&quot;.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>So what can you do to stop the spread of bad information online? You want to help family and friends and keep them in the loop. So when you receive fresh advice - whether by email, WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter - you might quickly forward it on to family and friends. But experts say the number one thing you can do to halt misinformation is to simply stop and think.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Before you forward it on, ask some basic questions about where the information comes from. It&apos;s a big red flag if the source is &quot;a friend of a friend&quot; or &quot;my aunt&apos;s colleague&apos;s neighbour&quot;. Some of the details in the post were accurate - some versions, for example, encouraged hand washing to slow the spread of the virus. But other details were potentially harmful, making unproven claims about how to diagnose the illness. &quot;The most reliable sources of information remain public health bodies like the Experts are not infallible. But public health bodies like the Experts are much more reliable than a stranger&apos;s distant relative on WhatsApp.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Who do you trust for health advice? It is possible to impersonate official accounts and authorities, including BBC News and the government. Screenshots can also be changed to make it look like information has come from a trusted public body. Check known and verified accounts and websites. If you can&apos;t easily find the information, it might be a hoax. And if a post, video or a link looks fishy - it probably is. Capital letters and mismatched fonts are something fact-checkers use as an indicator a post might be misleading, according to Claire Milne from Full Fact. Don&apos;t forward things on &quot;just in case&quot; Capital letters and mismatched fonts might be true. You might be doing more harm than good. Often we post things into places where we know there are experts - like doctors or medical professionals. That might be OK, but make sure you&apos;re very clear about your doubts. And beware - that photo or text you share might later be stripped of your doubts context.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>There&apos;s a voice note that has been circulating on WhatsApp. The person speaking in a voice note that has been circulating on WhatsApp says she&apos;s translating advice from a &quot;colleague who has a friend&quot; working at a hospital.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>It&apos;s been sent to the BBC by dozens of people around the world. But It&apos;s a mix of accurate and inaccurate advice. When you get sent long lists of advice, it&apos;s easy to believe everything in them just because you know for certain that one of the tips (say, about hand washing) is true. Italy sees rapid spread of fake news What misinformation has spread in Africa? It&apos;s the stuff that gets us fearful, angry, anxious, or joyful that tends to really go viral. &quot;Fear is one of the biggest drivers that allows misinformation to thrive,&quot; says Claire Wardle of , an organisation that helps journalists tackle online misinformation. Urgent calls for action are designed to ramp up anxiety - so be careful. &quot;People want to help their loved ones stay safe, so when they see &apos;Tips for preventing the virus! &apos; or &apos;Take this health supplement! &apos;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>people want to do whatever they can to help,&quot; she says. Are you sharing something because you know it&apos;s true - or just because you agree with it?</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window The coronavirus outbreak has changed the way we all live and work - and, as a result, it&apos;s given us a whole new, unprecedented, set of problems. What if you can&apos;t stand your partner, now that you&apos;re in lockdown together and can no longer ignore their annoying traits? Or worse - what if you broke up just before the order to stay at home, and are now awkwardly stuck under the same roof? If you&apos;re lucky enough to work from home, how do you deal with difficult children - or a boss who likes to micromanage you remotely? What if you still have to go in to work - and your boss won&apos;t let you wear a mask? What if your parents are driving you crazy? Or what if you just feel really lonely?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>For decades, advice columnists - or &quot;agony aunts&quot; - have been the go-to place for people wanting to ask for advice anonymously. Now, the crisis means some columnists are getting more queries - and the questions have become more serious and urgent. &quot;The coronavirus outbreak has dramatically changed the type of mail I&apos;m getting,&quot; says Alison Green, who runs the popular Ask A Manager advice column. &quot;About 90% of Alison Green, who runs the popular Ask A Manager advice column are now related to The coronavirus outbreak. &quot; Harriette Cole, who writes the syndicated column Sense and Sensitivity, says &quot;there is no relationship today that isn&apos;t somehow affected&quot;. She has had questions ranging from dealing with over-friendly neighbours who won&apos;t social distance, to staying in touch with elderly parents who don&apos;t know how to use smart phones, to discussing class differences exposed by the pandemic with your child, after they realise all their friends have gone to second homes. Frankly, this is a time when we could all use some advice and support - so we spoke to some of the US&apos;s favourite agony aunts and uncles, to find out what problems are bothering their readers the most - and what advice they have. Ms Green says that, prior to The coronavirus outbreak, most of She reader questions were about awkward interactions. &quot;There was a lot of inter-personal stuff - like &apos;my co-worker is really annoying&apos;, or &apos;I&apos;m allergic to my boss&apos; perfume&apos;. I have almost none of those questions now - because that stuff goes away if you&apos;re not physically at work with people, and people&apos;s priorities are different now. &quot; Instead, She readers are particularly worried about job security - and Media playback is unsupported on your device It&apos;s a similar situation for Quentin Fottrell, who runs The Moneyist, an advice column on the finance media site Marketwatch. Instead of personal finance queries, he says the &quot;lion&apos;s share&quot; of questions are now about workplace safety - such as one from a grocery store worker who was in close proximity to customers, but &quot;Service workers in essential industries are really at the coal face,&quot; Mr Fottrell says. &quot;People are just grappling with bosses who don&apos;t understand the pandemic. &quot; The workers braving coronavirus in shops and pharmacies How safe is takeaway food and grocery shopping? On the front line of the coronavirus clean-up So what should you do if your workplace is unsafe? &quot;It&apos;s really hard, but if your employer is making decisions that jeopardise your health, you can try to push back as a group, because there&apos;s safety in numbers,&quot; says Ms Green.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;Depending on the situation, it might also be something you can report to the state authorities. &quot; &apos;Should I pay my cleaner even if they&apos;re not working? &apos; One question that struck Mr Fottrell came from someone who had due to social distancing - but wondered if they should keep paying they. Media playback is unsupported on your device &apos;My income vanished overnight with no safety net&apos; His advice? That paying would be a &quot;decent gesture&quot; if they could afford it.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Since service staff have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak, My income also suggests people tip 5% more than usual. &quot;I feel like it&apos;s the lower paid workers who are really taking the brunt of this virus through their workplaces - when I go to the supermarket, I always say &apos;thank you for working today&apos;. &quot; &apos;How do I handle working from home? &apos; Another common theme Ms Green has seen is about remote working - with managers expecting employees to work around the clock, or workers finding it difficult to be productive at home Media playback is unsupported on your device Coronavirus lockdown: The BBC speaks to the &quot;gatecrashing kids&quot; family who became a global hit in 2017 &quot;Managers are suddenly managing everyone remotely - and some don&apos;t know how to - so they micromanage, or want multiple check-ins every day. I&apos;ve heard from people whose managers wanted Managers to stay on video all day long&quot; to prove Managers&apos;re working, Ms Green says. For people with anxious bosses, Ms Green suggests that you offer to send them information at the start of each day about what you&apos;re working on, and try to explain that having several check-in meetings daily could actually make you less productive. Five ways to work well from home Four out of five jobs affected by virus globally Meanwhile, she tells managers that it&apos;s in their own interests to be supportive right now - and understanding of employees who may be less productive than usual. &quot;People have long memories. .. If People see you making life harder for your employees - People may not leave right away, but People will eventually. &quot; &apos;How do I date during the outbreak? &apos; Relationship advice columnists have also seen a drastic change. Harris O&apos;Malley runs the Dr Nerdlove column - which he describes as giving &quot;dating advice to geeks of all stripes&quot;. Previously, many questions were from readers who felt they were unattractive or socially awkward. Thanks to social distancing, many questions have fallen away - partly, Harris O&apos;Malley believes, because &quot;a lot of my audience feel more secure communicating over text or internet than in person&quot;. Media playback is unsupported on your device Dating, sex and relationships during the outbreak Instead, the outbreak has &quot;changed the mechanics&quot; of dating - and he now has to coach people on how to have good online dates. &quot;I&apos;m having to tell people about how to connect on a more mental or emotional level - how to keep relationships vibrant when you can&apos;t fall back on the easy outs. &quot;When you&apos;re not able to meet up in person, you can&apos;t say &apos;let&apos;s have this casual relationship and see if it goes anywhere&apos; - people are now finding they have to approach relationships with thought, care and attention. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Dan Savage, who runs the popular Savage Love column and podcast, says over 80% of the queries the mechanics&quot; of dating gets are now coronavirus-related - and the outbreak has forced the mechanics&quot; of dating to change the mechanics&quot; of dating advice as &quot;the very premise of many sex and dating questions has been exploded&quot; by the outbreak.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>with partners they live with to observe social distancing. &quot;It&apos;s funny how this crisis has mainstreamed online sex - even a government health department is now telling people that How to look after your mental health Beyond online sex, Dan Savage says many readers &quot;find being forced to spend every moment with their partner is exposing cracks in their relationship&quot;. It&apos;s important that couples &quot;carve out time alone&quot; even when they are under the same roof, Dan Savage says. &quot;We interpret someone wanting &apos;alone time&apos; as rejection, but studies show one predictor of long-term success in a couple is the ability to spend time apart. &quot; Media playback is unsupported on your device How dating and love continue for three couples during the coronavirus lockdown. Some of the most memorable questions he received came from just before the shelter-in-place order, and a woman who told her husband In those cases, he has suggested that readers stay put where possible, and &quot;acknowledge the awkwardness&quot;. In the case of the woman who wanted to leave a woman who told her husbher husband, he suggested signalling some flexibility for now - even if a woman who told her husband mind&apos;s made up - to make a woman who told her husband temporary living situation more bearable for them both. All the relationship advice columnists we spoke to said they received more questions from and feel particularly lonely right now. Mr O&apos;Malley says clients &quot;who are lonely and want to date&quot; have asked him whether All the relationship advice can flirt with people All the relationship advice see in public places. &quot;I&apos;ve had to tell All the relationship advice: no, you really can&apos;t - it&apos;s kind of irresponsible to do so right now. &quot; How to cope with living alone in isolation Ms Cole has received a lot of what she describes as - from teenagers who like each other and have started communicating on Snapchat, but are unable to hang out at school and get to know each other. &quot;Normally by now All the relationship advice would be [meeting] each other. Now all All the relationship advice have is social media,&quot; living alone in isolation Ms Cole says. living alone in isolation Ms Cole advice? To try doing things the old-school way, by &quot;literally talking on the phone&quot;, because &quot;engaging in lengthier conversations will help you to get to know each other better&quot;.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Media playback is unsupported on your device Mr Savage urges single readers not to assume that couples are happier. &quot;Happiness is something we create for ourselves. We all need to build lives that are rich, as individuals, because there will be times in all our lives when we&apos;re un-partnered. Work on getting happy now - you can work on getting partnered later. &quot; He says he has seen a dramatic jump in the number of reader queries - and is &quot;getting a lot of letters from people who&apos;ve found they&apos;ve had to re-closet themselves&quot; during the pandemic. &apos;I&apos;m stuck in isolation with my homophobic parents&apos; Some of He readers are out to their friends but not their parents, while others may be out, but still &quot;feel more comfortable expressing their full selves outside their homes&quot;. &quot;Now that a lot of people find themselves at home with their parents 24/7, a lot of anxiety returns - they feel re-closeted or like they&apos;re losing who they are. &quot; His advice is to remember that &quot;this is temporary, and you&apos;re still you&quot;, and to try and communicate your feelings with a supportive family member or friends. His also urges people to reach out to others - &quot;everyone wants to be connected right now… pain is what bonds people together&quot;. &apos;How do I mentally get through the outbreak? &quot; These may be unprecedented times - but coronavirus isn&apos;t the first crisis the world has faced. Ms Green started the Ask a Manager column in 2007 - shortly before the recession hit - and remembers that &quot;for years, my mail was very depressing&quot;. Media playback is unsupported on your device Five ways to look after your mental health during isolation Similarly, Mr Savage began Mr Savage column in 1991, and says Mr Savage early column was dominated by questions from readers anxious about the HIV/Aids crisis. Mr Savage emphasises that things won&apos;t always be like this. &quot;It&apos;s terrifying, I&apos;m scared, but we will come through this… the HIV/Aids crisis is highlighting a lot of social injustices, and hopefully that will stiffen we resolve to do something about it after the HIV/Aids crisis ends. &quot; Meanwhile, Mr Fottrell says &quot;one of the most valuable functions of an advice column is it shows people who haven&apos;t written in&quot; that others are experiencing similar problems. &quot;You are not alone. we always think we situations are unique - and while we are unique as people, if you&apos;re experiencing something, you can be sure many others are too. &quot;</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>from following the HIV/Aids crisis. Agony aunts as well as their readers welcome having the chance to address something different, columnists told BBC. Mr O&apos;Malley recalls a recent question submitted to the Dr Nerdlove column, where a reader was &quot;worried about the size and appearance of Mr O&apos;Malley genitalia&quot;. &quot;I never thought I&apos;d say this - but I really appreciated a question that wasn&apos;t about Covid-19!</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: How Iran is battling a new wave of coronavirus These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Iran is facing rising numbers of infections and deaths Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Iran started to relax Iran restrictions in mid-April, after the number of infections declined, so what&apos;s happened since then? How fast are deaths rising in Iran? Iran&apos;s daily reported death toll has been rising sharply in recent weeks. In mid-June, deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. this figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. this figure was 3,186 on 30 March - during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst affected countries outside China. So Iran has seen both an upsurge in infections and a marked increase in daily deaths since the initial outbreak of the coronavirus subsided. In April, Iran began to ease Iran restrictions as daily infections fell: 20 April: Shopping malls and bazaars reopened and travel resumed between different provinces The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases. Iran&apos;s chief epidemiologist at Iran&apos;s health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: &quot;The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms. &quot; Iran has been increasing Iran testing, reaching about one in every 45 people by 7 July, considerably more than Iran did at the start of The epidemic. But that&apos;s still less than the US or countries in Europe that have been hit by The epidemic. The proportion of tests in Iran that return a positive result began to rise in late May and early June, reaching 14%. But since then it&apos;s stayed between nine and 10%. That&apos;s about ten tests for each positive case. The WHO has suggested 10 to 30 tests per positive case as a general benchmark for adequate testing, That means that at the moment, Iran may not be doing quite enough testing to find all cases.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Is Iran covering up the coronavirus outbreak? What&apos;s the true global death toll for coronavirus? Health Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social distancing rules. Officials have complained Iranians are not observing social distancing &quot;People have become completely careless regarding this disease,&quot; Health Minister Saeed Namaki told the Iranian news agency.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>And a health ministry poll in early June suggested only: 40% of the population were keeping the social-distancing rules, down from 90% earlier in the coronavirus outbreak What options do the authorities have? During the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities were criticised for the authorities hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites, and for not moving quicker to introduce restrictions. The leadership in Iran cannot afford to continue restrictions because of the state of the economy, according to BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour. BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour adds that BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. However, President Rouhani has now told Iranians they must wear face masks on public transport and in crowded areas, and said where necessary, the police and security forces will enforce the rules. And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for action to stop the rising level of new infections, and criticised those who don&apos;t wear face masks.</paragraphs>

Around 570,000 people have lost their lives. This series of maps and charts tracks the global spread of the virus. Where are coronavirus cases and deaths still rising? The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19 then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020, reaching 12 million confirmed cases in early July. Europe and North America saw the first major outbreaks in April but as they began to ease, Latin America and Asia started seeing an increase in cases. North America has seen a resurgence of infections in recent weeks, mostly driven by new outbreaks in the US. World Health Organization (WH) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that in most of the world, the virus is not under control and is &quot;getting worse&quot;. The head of the Pan American Health Organization, Dr Carissa Etienne says there is no doubt have become the epicentre of the pandemic. Dr Carissa Etienne says coronavirus is spreading &quot;exponentially&quot; in many areas of the region and the peak of the crisis could be some weeks away.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Brazil has been the worst-hit so far with a death toll of more than 72,000. Mexico now has the world&apos;s fourth largest death toll with more than 35,000 deaths from almost 300,000 confirmed cases. Colombia has announced it is extending its nationwide lockdown by more than two weeks after reported cases and deaths accelerated in several cities. India now has more almost 850,000 confirmed cases, the third highest number in the world, and saw its biggest spike on Saturday with over 27,000 cases reported in 24 hours. The current surge in cases comes despite an earlier nationwide lockdown that lasted more than two months. Nearly a dozen Indian states have now re-imposed partial lockdowns. South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of South Africa so this could be distorting official estimates of how far the virus has spread. South Africa has seen a doubling of confirmed cases over the last two weeks. South Africa has introduced new restrictions, including another ban on alcohol sales to take the pressure off the healthcare system. Previous pandemics have unfolded in &quot;waves&quot; of infections, with fresh outbreaks recurring after the initial peak subsides. Health experts think Covid-19 may follow a similar pattern, but there is no firm agreement on what exactly constitutes a second wave. Although a number of countries have seen a rise in infections after appearing to have the virus under control, they may still be in the first stages of the outbreak. And rising cases may sometimes be down to increased testing. Iran saw a renewed surge in cases in May and June, but they have steadied in recent weeks. There has also been a surge in cases in Israel since restrictions were eased at the end of May. In Australia, the city of Melbourne has now begun a second lockdown after a recent spike in infections, with residents barred from leaving home for six weeks, except for essential reasons. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has banned international visitors from making the Islamic pilgrimage, or Hajj, this year in an attempt to control the outbreak. US seeing a second surge of cases The US is seeing record numbers of confirmed daily cases, with figures tipping over 60,000 in recent days. Deaths were falling until recently, but have started to rise over the last week. North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon, Hawaii and Alaska recorded their highest daily totals for coronavirus cases on Saturday. Florida, which has proved vulnerable due to tourism and an elderly population, has hit record daily cases twice in the last 10 days. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country&apos;s top health official for infectious diseases, has called for some states to consider pausing the end to their lockdowns. The White House has said the rise in cases is a product of an uptick in US testing capacity.</paragraphs>

				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>3 million cases of the virus and over 135,000 deaths. the death toll could hit 175,000 by October - though it says this could be reduced to 150,000 if 95% of Americans wear masks in public. in public for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March. A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. Globally, at least 4. 5 billion people - half the world&apos;s population - were living under social distancing measures at the height of A pandemic in Europe, according to the AFP news agency&apos;s estimates. Those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that A pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, have passed the peak of infections, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. In mid-June, the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases warned that the risk of a &quot;second wave&quot; of infections requiring the reintroduction of lockdowns was Italy has the second highest death toll in the region with nearly 35,000, while France is on about 30,000 and Spain 28,400. However, differences in population size and how countries report the risk of a &quot;second wave&quot; of infections requiring the reintroduction of lockdowns was Italy has the second highest death toll in the region with nearly 35,000, while France is on about 30,000 and Spain 28,400 figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means that final The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. this page includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country&apos;s elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.</paragraphs>

We&apos;ve examined some of the most widely seen examples. People opposed to the wearing of masks to tackle the spread of Covid-19 have been vocal in public meetings and on social media. Footage of individuals resisting requirements to wear them in shops have gone viral online.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Now, the US Justice Department has put out a statement about &quot;fraudulent cards&quot; that purport to give the carrier an exemption from wearing a face mask in public. The cards for sale state that &quot;under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you&quot;. One version includes a the US Justice Department seal and a link to the &quot;Freedom to Breathe Agency&quot;.

				<paragraphs>No evidence masks harm the immune system Meanwhile, medical misinformation about masks continues to circulate. One graphic shared thousands of times includes several misleading claims. It&apos;s called, What happens when you wear a face mask, and has been marked as containing false information on Instagram. The World Health Organization is clear in its advice - face masks of a breathable material which are worn properly will not lead to health problems. The World Health Organization says: &quot;The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. &quot; The post claims No evidence masks could suppress the body&apos;s immune system, though there is no evidence to back this up. &quot;Masks may stop germs getting into your mouth or nose, so your immune system doesn&apos;t have to kick in, but this doesn&apos;t mean it is being suppressed,&quot; says Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert. Misleading news about the coronavirus seems to be everywhere. There&apos;s still a lot we don&apos;t know about the pandemic, which helps misinformation to thrive. Throw a lot of unfamiliar science or statistics into the mix and it can be difficult to know what to believe. Plenty of posts appear authoritative so it&apos;s always wise to check if something you read on social media has been reported by an organisation you can trust. tips you can follow to help spot misinformation It was shared by various accounts including one claiming to be a &quot;Natural Medicine Database&quot; with 70,000 followers and a version translated into Russian (not labelled false) by an account promoting a range of conspiracy theories. Much of the the anti-mask content comes in the form of memes making fun of them, which are widely shared on social media. One viral example compares the hazmat-style clothing worn by virologists working in a lab to protect against viruses with the face coverings that members of the public might be making at home. The earliest version appeared on a Q-Anon - - account and has also been posted by Donald Trump Jr generating more than 100,000 likes and shares. But the US Centers for Disease Control does actually recommend bandanas and other cloth face coverings which can help stop the spread of the virus in a public setting A video titled, A doctor&apos;s confession, suggesting coronavirus cases are being inflated has been viewed 1. 5m times on TikTok, the video-sharing platform. It&apos;s claimed the reason coronavirus case numbers are so high is because anyone who walks into hospital - be it with a broken leg or bullet wound - is &quot;written up as Covid positive&quot;.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The man in the video is Darrell Wolfe who&apos;s based in Canada. The man in the video says The man in the video works in &quot;natural medicine&quot;. The clip was originally uploaded to Facebook (where it has had 265,000 views) and describes the situation in a local hospital which The man in the video claims comes &quot;straight from a doctor&quot;. The clip posted by a TikTok account did not name the person speaking. Many of the thousands of people who&apos;ve commented clearly believe The man in the video&apos;s describing the situation in the US. But there&apos;s no evidence we&apos;ve seen to support this claim about counting coronavirus cases - whether applied to the US or Canada. There are clear criteria for reporting coronavirus cases in both countries, and people who enter hospital with an unrelated illness or injury aren&apos;t counted as a coronavirus case. Bill Gates and the lab targeted by conspiracy theorists A video viewed 750,000 times on YouTube calls the pandemic a &quot;mass media disinformation campaign&quot; and a &quot;political hoax&quot;. the pandemic contains various unsubstantiated claims blaming the &quot;deep state&quot; for manufacturing the pandemic in an election year. The opening credits have a foreboding air, using World War Two footage and images of stormy skies in a homemade attempt at a Netflix documentary. The description of A video urges people to &quot;ditch the masks&quot;. The narrator suggests Democratic politicians intentionally put the public in harm&apos;s way to increase the number of coronavirus fatalities and to stoke fear around the pandemic.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Why surviving the virus may be just the beginning These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask. Simon Farrell had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe. &quot;I was trying to pull his oxygen mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting his oxygen mask back on,&quot; Simon Farrell recalls. When doctors woke Simon Farrell up, Simon Farrell body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but Simon Farrell still needed oxygen to support Simon Farrell damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium Simon Farrell was trying to deny Simon Farrell the oxygen Simon Farrell required.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;Try to stop me,&quot; Simon Farrell remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put Simon Farrell hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless Simon Farrell relaxed. &quot;In the end nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital had to tape his hands up. I was trying to tear glove-sized medical mittens off, I managed to bite through nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital had to put new mittens on. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient. That has produced &quot;a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation&quot;, explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London&apos;s Royal Free Hospital. &quot;Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they&apos;re less confused and less disoriented than this. &quot; &quot;This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator. &quot; Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors. &quot;Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,&quot; says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester. &quot;But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>it has become a national priority - to support people to get better. &quot; Tens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey. Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of others have had their lives changed by Covid-19. But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start. Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don&apos;t get too stiff. &quot;For example, we have an in-bed bike,&quot; explains Kate Tantam. &quot;Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike. &quot; &quot;we bring a bike to the bed, and we can put lots of drugs feet into a bike, and the machine can then do the work for you. &quot; ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It&apos;s all part of the process of preparing patients for the moment when patients are woken up. &quot;Some patients do wake up saying, &apos;I remember your voice,&apos;&quot; says Kulwant Dhadwal.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;Some patients wake up with some kind of memory. &quot; But the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time. Many of Some patients woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly. &quot;Usually when somebody&apos;s been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for Some patients to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,&quot; Kulwant Dhadwal says. &quot;But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation. Many patients can&apos;t cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of critical illness with Covid-19. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator. &quot;You&apos;ve got to look after the tracheostomy, it&apos;s a wound in the neck,&quot; explains Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. &quot;So, it was a long, slow process getting Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading off the ventilator. it might take Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading a week or two weeks or even longer. &quot; And behind every observation lies a human story.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Abraham Raskin&apos;s family were told in late April that it was unlikely he would survive. But on 12 June Abraham Raskin&apos;s finally left the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading after more than 50 days in intensive care, a tracheostomy, and a month in a medically induced coma. On a video call arranged by nurses on 18 May Abraham RaskiAbraham Raskin&apos;s family saw Abraham Raskin&apos;s face for the first time since Abraham Raskin&apos;s was taken into hospital in early April. Abraham Raskin&apos;s wasn&apos;t able to say anything, but Abraham Raskin&apos;s did raise an eyebrow. Abraham Raskin&apos;s was severely delirious for some time after waking up. &quot;I was talking all kinds of rubbish,&quot; Abraham Raskin&apos;s says. &quot;Afterwards when I heard about what I was saying, I felt like I was mad or something. It&apos;s not pleasant. &quot; But Abraham Raskin&apos;s is now back at home, still very tired, and following a basic exercise programme planned from Abraham Raskin&apos;s by a physiotherapist.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>With support from family members, Abraham Raskin&apos;s can get upstairs to sleep at night. &quot;Some people can&apos;t really walk anymore when they come out of this,&quot; Abraham Raskin&apos;s says, &quot;and some take months to recover. I hope I&apos;m not one of Some people. &quot; As many as three-quarters of intensive care patients who need mechanical ventilation to help Some people breathe will suffer from delirium. And the observations of many doctors suggest that delirium has been particularly acute, and hallucinations unusually vivid, for people who fall critically ill with Covid-19. Delirium can be caused by the infection itself, and the fevers which accompany it. But the infection itself is intensified by the strong sedative drugs that have to be used to keep patients comfortable, and the unsettling environment of intensive care they find themselves in. While patients are in a coma, and after they wake up and begin withdrawing from these drugs, they often experience frightening hallucinations, and cling to unsettling beliefs about what is going on. &quot;Delirium doesn&apos;t have a dreamlike quality,&quot; says Dorothy Wade, the principal health psychologist in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. &quot;Patients always say &apos;it was completely real - I was just living in this terrifying alternative reality. &apos;&quot; Doctors think that chemical imbalances prompt the brain to create its own explanation for why the body can&apos;t move and the patient can&apos;t speak. Often people think they&apos;ve been kidnapped or tortured, or they think they&apos;re in a prison cell about to be put on trial. &quot;people tend to feel that the nurses and the doctors and the staff are all in some conspiracy,&quot; says Dorothy Wade, &quot;that this is all part of a conspiracy to make money out of them by selling their blood or their organs. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>It means that psychologists like Dorothy Wade try to step in as early as possible. It&apos;s important not to argue with delirious patients, Dorothy Wade says, but instead to try to offer reassurance about what has really been happening. Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced. &quot;I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,&quot; Simon Farrell says. &quot;Now, that clearly wasn&apos;t right. No children were allowed on the ward. hospital was locked down. hospital didn&apos;t happen. &quot; In Simon Farrell head at the time, though, Simon Farrell believed it to be absolutely true. &quot;You just feel it is what&apos;s happening,&quot; Simon Farrell says. &quot;And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one. &quot; What are the guidelines on getting out? What it means and why it matters How many cases in your area?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can&apos;t be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE. &quot;It has a huge impact on patients,&quot; explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. &quot;Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult. &quot; &quot;If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they&apos;re not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can&apos;t understand why there are no visitors. &quot; And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family. Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife, works as a neuro physiotherapist at the Salford Royal Hothe Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Birmingham where he was a patient. Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife recalls one evening when he was still severely delirious, a nurse Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife knew rang and suggested that hearing Hannah Farrell, Simon&apos;s wife voice on the phone might calm Simon down. &quot;For Simon, it was quite upsetting, and I&apos;m sure other relatives have said the same. &quot; Some patients can still be delirious weeks after waking up. And delirium, says Kate Tantam, along with other frightening early experiences, &quot;is the key link to post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression&quot; among people who survive their time in ICU. Roughly one in five people who pass through intensive care in normal times go on to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And the signs are that with Covid patients that number could be considerably higher. The same goes for more general anxiety and depression after leaving hospital. The extreme circumstances of the Covid pandemic, and the social isolation that has come with it, are likely to make things worse. The lack of a reassuring family presence, for example, continues to pose additional problems after patients are released from acute hospital wards into care homes and rehabilitation units. Hospitals have invested in iPads to facilitate contact, and family liaison teams make sure video calls take place every day, but it&apos;s not quite the same. Krystyna Walton gives the example of one of her patients who had severe Covid pneumonia, as well as renal failure and dialysis.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The patient spent several weeks in critical care, and several more on a medical ward before being moved to a rehabilitation ward with cognitive deficits. They have not been able to see their family for three months. Normally in a rehabilitation unit, staff would try to personalise a patient&apos;s surroundings and encourage them to wear their own clothes. But the restrictions surrounding Covid have prevented much of that. And because family members are unable to visit, or speak to medical staff face-to-face, they often struggle to understand just how sick their relative has been. &quot;There are no visitors in care homes, there are no visitors in rehabilitation in the NHS or in the independent sector,&quot; says Krystyna Walton. &quot;And even after leaving rehab there have been restrictions that we all have had to deal with, which makes it more difficult to visit a vulnerable person in their own home. All of this has a huge psychological impact. &quot; So, the NHS is going to have to prepare for the possibility of a fresh wave of PTSD patients, just as the NHS is trying to deal with a backlog of mental health (and other) cases which have been neglected during the worst of the pandemic. &quot;We won&apos;t know for several months how big a problem this is going to be,&quot; says Dorothy Wade. &quot;To begin with people are very relieved to be out of hospital, especially after such a long stay. Sometimes it can take quite a long time for people to realise that something still isn&apos;t quite right. &quot; It doesn&apos;t always turn out that way. Alongside post-traumatic stress, doctors acknowledge the concept of post-traumatic growth, and point to patients who emerge from critical care with a new outlook on life. &quot;There are some people who - no matter how difficult this has been - find themselves in a more positive frame of mind,&quot; explains Julie Highfield, a consultant clinical psychologist based in intensive care units in Cardiff. &quot;People feel this is a chance they never thought they would have, and they are determined to live their life well. &quot; Simon Farrell is certainly trying to focus on the positive and Simon Farrell has been recovering week by week. But Simon Farrell admits it has to be tinged with realism.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;I think people feel if they get physically stronger, they&apos;re then mentally stronger and they&apos;re fine. And that&apos;s not always the case. The two are not aligned. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>For many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care. &quot;Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you&apos;ve got in the neck,&quot; says Kate Tantam. And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips. &quot;We have to rebuild everything with thousands of Covid-19 patients,&quot; Kate Tantam says, &quot;and teach thousands of Covid-19 patients how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit. &quot; A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. many Covid-19 patients are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time. &quot;If We don&apos;t give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,&quot; Kate Tantam says. So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover. Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care. The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, &quot;is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time. &quot; &quot;I think the greatest burden will be in the community,&quot; argues Krystyna Walton, &quot;because many of Many Covid patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to Many Covid patients as Many Covid patients start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home. &quot; The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;For patients that are coming out of hospital,&quot; says Sally Singh, &quot;clearly they&apos;re breathless because they&apos;ve had a respiratory disease. they lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they&apos;ve been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they&apos;ve become pretty unfit. &quot; It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who&apos;ve been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off. Jenny Goldblatt, an infectious diseases doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and the coronavirus has lingered ever since - returning in waves of fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties. She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that She problems began in earnest. &quot;Every 10 days or so I&apos;d start to feel a little better and I&apos;d start to go for longer walks,&quot; She says. &quot;But then I&apos;d crash in a heap and couldn&apos;t get out of bed for a week. &quot; It was a month after falling ill that She first managed to walk to the end of the road and back. A keen cyclist, She next goal is to cycle around the block. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine when I will be able to take my bike for a proper ride, and if I think about that too much it gets a bit depressing. &quot; She thinks She has cleared the virus, and She has &quot;easily detectable&quot; antibodies in She blood, but She body is continuing to react in unusual ways. Post-viral fatigue is not unique to Covid-19, but this is something more. She has suffered chest pains and breathlessness; other patients with lingering symptoms report severe headaches or abdominal pains. Three months after falling ill, going back to work or resuming normal life is out of the question. &quot;I am getting better slowly,&quot; She says, &quot;but I can&apos;t be too ambitious. It is frustrating to be on this rollercoaster, with absolutely no idea how long the journey will take. &quot; Previous medical experience with pneumonia suggests it can take months, or in extreme cases years, for patients to get back to where they were before. With Covid-19, we are still early in the cycle of rehabilitation and recovery, and every patient is different. &quot;The honest answer is we don&apos;t yet know how long it will take,&quot; says Sally Singh.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;People are researching that as we speak - monitoring chest x-rays, symptoms and the wellbeing of patients to help us identify what the best intervention to support these people may be. &quot; The trouble is the provision of rehabilitation services across the country can be patchy, especially for people emerging from critical care. And the NHS is already dealing with a massive backlog of non-Covid cases that have been delayed. &quot;The huge challenge,&quot; says Krystyna Walton, &quot;is going to be the increase in numbers. &quot; At the peak of the outbreak the priority was to get patients out of acute hospital settings quickly to free up bed space. That means in many cases the rehabilitation assessments that would normally be done in hospital would have been done in the community, or in a care home or a non-specialist rehabilitation setting. &quot;And my suspicion,&quot; Krystyna Walton adds, &quot;is that many patients may have not had their needs assessed properly. &quot; Carl Waldmann, who has been working on improving the rehabilitation of seriously ill patients for more than 25 years, says one of the best analogies he can think of is building a rocket, and training an astronaut.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;You put them up into space, but you also have to think about where they&apos;re going to land and what we&apos;re going to do when they get back. &quot; It is the same, he says, if you put a patient through the complexities of intensive care. &quot;we&apos;ve had some patients who need seven specialists looking after them afterwards,&quot; he says, &quot;and unless they have all those bits of the jigsaw puzzle, there is a chance they won&apos;t make the recovery they could have made. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>It is important to emphasise those rehabilitation needs don&apos;t stop after the immediate recovery period. Many patients will suffer from - a permanent and often debilitating condition. Doctors also know that a significant number of people who have been critically ill have suffered cognitive deficits. Ideally Doctors should have screening for return to driving a vehicle, and for return to work. &quot;Rehabilitation has to sort of blur into real life and getting back out into the community,&quot; says Krystyna Walton, &quot;doing what you used to do before, looking after your family, earning an income, enjoying leisure facilities and exercise. &quot; &quot;And that is what takes time and expertise. &quot; The NHS and individual hospitals are of course building rehabilitation into their Covid recovery plans, but this is a system that has been overlooked for years. Experts in the field hope, despite all the pressures, that Covid will provide a launch pad for change. &quot;Hospitals are very good at treating people, doing something to somebody to make them better,&quot; says Kate Tantam. &quot;But what Hospitals are not always very good at is prioritising the therapeutic and rehabilitation input afterwards. &quot; &quot;There is no point giving somebody a massive intensive care stay, if you don&apos;t try to return Hospitals to where Hospitals want to be. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: &quot;We&apos;ve never seen anything like this before. &quot; They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year. And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection. &quot;It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,&quot; says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, &quot;with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing&quot;. But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise. Read how doctors on the front lines are observing things that they have never encountered before - and it&apos;s a challenge.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>While it took nearly 100 days for Africa to reach an initial 100,000 cases, it took only 18 days for that to double to 200,000. it doubled again to 400,000 cases over the next 20 days.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The upward trend in Africa is starting to resemble other parts of the world that have been badly hit by the coronavirus. Most African countries are now experiencing community transmission, according to the WHO. This is when a person gets Covid-19 without having been in contact with a known case from abroad or a confirmed domestic case, which makes it hard for for the authorities to track down the source of a local outbreak.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. The two countries with the highest numbers of cases accounted for over 60% of all the new cases reported in late June.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases and reported deaths. South Africa imposed one of the world&apos;s strictest lockdowns in late March, but has seen cases rise steadily after this was relaxed in early May. The Western Cape province (where Cape Town is located), accounts for nearly half of all cases in South Africa and more than half of deaths. But cases are steadily rising in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg. Egypt has seen case numbers rising rapidly since mid-May, but there are indications that this may now have reached a peak with recorded new infections levelling off slightly in early July. There is also concern about what is happening in Nigeria, which recorded the second-highest increase in deaths from Covid-19 after South Africa in the WHO report for 1 July.</paragraphs>

Mauritania has also seen a steep increase in cases in recent weeks. Mauritania&apos;s worth stressing that parts of the continent have seen relatively few cases, such as some areas of East Africa. In fact, the latest WHO Africa region report said just 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of all the reported cases on the continent. How many people are dying in Africa? The reported death rate per capita has been low compared to other parts of the world, despite the poor health infrastructure in many African countries.

Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date. Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data The WHO says this could be partly because of the relatively young population in Africa - more than 60% under the age of 25. Covid-19 is known to have a higher mortality rate for older age groups. Another way to look at death rates is to see what proportion of people who get Covid-19 go on to die. On this basis, there are five countries with death rates that are comparable to or higher than the most recent global average rate of just under 5%: But Githinji Gitahi, the head of Amref Health Africa, an NGO which specialises in health matters, says the higher rates could be an indication of much higher infection levels than those being recorded, and that it could be down to low levels of testing. The fewer tests you carry out, the fewer cases you find, and so the number of deaths appears relatively high. Different methods of reporting deaths may also affect the number of deaths. For example, where community health workers and other frontline staff record Covid-19 deaths, such as in Chad, you could get a higher death rate.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>How much testing is done in Africa? There are wide variations in testing rates, with Africa doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few, according to Our World in Data, On 4 July, Africa was doing just over 30 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 72 in the UK and 105 in the US. It&apos;s worth pointing out that for some African countries, it is impossible to know what exactly is happening due to a lack of any data or data being incomplete. &quot;We have to take the numbers with a pinch of salt,&quot; says Chiedo Nwankwor, a lecturer in African affairs at Johns Hopkins University in the US. In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has voiced doubts about the validity of virus testing results at the national laboratory, and has allowed only limited data on infection rates and testing to be made public. Equatorial Guinea had a row with the WHO after accusing its country representative of inflating the number of Covid-19 cases. For a while Equatorial Guinea held back Equatorial Guinea data, but has now started sharing Equatorial Guinea again. And in Kano state in northern Nigeria, an unusual spike of close to 1,000 deaths was reported in late April, but Equatorial Guinea has not still confirmed how many were due to Covid-19. Note: The graphics in this page use a different source for figures for France from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Where are cases rising and falling? What are the symptoms of the coronavirus?</paragraphs>

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd made the plea after hundreds of bands marched in Twelfth parades. The Orange Order called off large demonstrations because of Covid-19 and asked people to celebrate at home. The Orange Order advice was followed in most areas, but social distancing was ignored in some parts of Belfast. Bands march in local Twelfth parades across NI A crowd of more than 100 people gathered on the Shankill Road, where people thronged the footpaths and stood outside bars to watch one of the bands which had been playing. A crowd gathered on the Shankill Road on Monday afternoon However, in many other areas in Belfast, people stayed in their homes and watched bands as they passed. Other events, including wreath-laying ceremonies, were held across Northern Ireland with social distancing largely being observed. On Monday evening, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: &quot;I am pleased that today has passed without major incident.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today&apos;s events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day. &quot;I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe. &quot;I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with our to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety. &quot; Each year, the Orange Order marks the anniversary of the victory of Protestant William of Orange over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. Commemorations are usually held on 12 July but due to the Twelfth falling on a Sunday Each year, it was marked on Monday, 13 July. Valerie Quinn, from the Ulster Bands Forum, said both bonfires and parades were &quot;vastly reduced in numbers attending and size&quot;, with organisations needing credit for &quot;adhering to the existing restrictions&quot;. &quot;The efforts that the Orange Order and the bands have gone to in order to mark the day in some way safely are wonderful,&quot; she told BBC News NI&apos;s Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday.</paragraphs>

Some have decided not to open, claiming a lack of preparation time has made a shorter summer season &quot;unviable&quot;.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Many are run by community groups or charities and have mounted fundraising efforts in order to survive. , swimmers can visit outdoor pools from Saturday, while indoor gyms, pools and sports facilities can reopen from 25 July.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Pool operators have said the government announcement allowing them to reopen came too late to allow them to go through the process of cleaning and filling pools and meeting both water-quality and coronavirus safety standards. Media playback is unsupported on your device more than 100 outdoor public swimming baths around the country - many restored and run by community groups. The volunteer-run Hilsea Lido in Hampshire said on Facebook, &quot;with a heavy heart&quot;, it would not reopen until 2021. &quot;With no clear indication of when we would be allowed to open, we were not able to prepare the pool in advance. &quot;The volunteer-run Hilsea Lido in Hampshire is a massive pool and the preparation costs reflect this,&quot; The volunteer-run Hilsea Lido in Hampshire said. The volunteer-run Hilsea Lido in Hampshire, takes two weeks to fill and two weeks to heat up Peterborough&apos;s lido is among those not reopening this weekend In Berkshire Covid-19 restrictions meant contractors were not been able to complete repair work on Northcroft Lido, which will remain closed as a result. Droitwich Lido will also not reopen this weekend after Droitwich Lido operator was forced to hand back its council contract due to financial difficulties during the crisis. Among those planning to open is Lymington Sea Water Baths in Hampshire which dates back to the early 19th Century. Manager Hugo Ambrose said: &quot;It&apos;s certainly not going to be a good, viable year but I do think there&apos;s a community we need to work with. &quot; Cornwall&apos;s coastal art deco Jubilee Pool in Penzance is hoping to reopen at the end of July. Operations officer Nicola Murdoch said reopening &quot;isn&apos;t possible at 48 hours notice&quot; and would require a deep clean, staff training and social distancing measures. &quot;It&apos;s fantastic to have the green light, but a little more notice like indoor leisure centres would have been helpful,&quot; she added. The covers remain on Droitwich Lido which plans to reopen for six weeks this summer Droitwich Lido plans to open in August thanks to a £55,000 grant from Wychavon Council. Manager Tim Kirkham said: &quot;We&apos;re in winter mode - we&apos;ve got a lot of work and power washing to do but I&apos;m sure We can do it.</paragraphs>

Authorities cancelled the traditional military parade but instead are holding a tribute to those tackling the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The annual events mark the storming of Bastille prison on 14 July 1789, seen as the start of the French Revolution. It is the first time officials have called off the annual military parade through the capital Paris since the end of World War Two in 1945. President Emmanuel Macron will give a rare televised interview after ceremonies in the morning. Around 2,000 French soldiers gathered for a ceremony in the Place de la Concorde, scheduled to start at 11:00 local time (09:00 GMT). It will begin with a tribute to Gen Charles de Gaulle, who 80 years ago famously called on France to resist the Nazi German occupation in a radio address from the BBC in London. Johnson welcomes Macron for talks and flypast Though there will be no parade, the troops will honour all those mobilised to tackle the coronavirus outbreak - including health workers and the armed forces. A traditional fly past will include military aircraft as well as a transport plane used to carry Covid-19 patients at the height of the pandemic in France. 2,000 French soldiers will take part in a ceremony in Paris Soldiers gathered in central Paris for the events Some 2,500 specially invited audience members - including the families of health workers who died during the pandemic - will watch from socially-distanced seating.</paragraphs>

President Macron cancelled the annual tradition when President Macron took office in 2017. But critics have criticised President Macron handling of the pandemic and President Macron lack of television appearances, and Elysée Palace officials say President Macron will address the outbreak and efforts to revive the French economy. Critics accuse President Macron of mishandling the coronavirus response France mostly has its national outbreak under control, but a number of public health officials have warned recently of the risks of a second wave.

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Why some countries wear face masks and others don&apos;t These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window People wearing masks has become an ubiquitous sight in many places in Asia, including China Step outside your door without a face mask in Hong Kong, Seoul or Tokyo, and you may well get a disapproving look. In recent weeks, many European nations have issued advisories to wear a mask in certain public settings, and in England the latest advice is to wear a face covering in &quot;enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible&quot; , such as public transport and some shops. Several US states have also given similar advice, and even the White House now makes it compulsory for all staff to wear face masks - though President Donald Trump still refuses to wear one. How to make your own face mask Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Many people are still not wearing masks despite official advice though, and some governments remain unconvinced about the science. Why some people embrace masks while others shun them is not just about government directives and medical advice - it&apos;s also about culture and history, a debate over evidence, and even about personal liberties.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the official advice from the World Health Organization has been that only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus. Nobody else needs to wear a mask, and experts have given several reasons for that. One is that a mask is not seen as reliable protection as other methods, given that current research shows the virus is spread by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>So the virus could protect you, but only in certain situations such as when you&apos;re in close quarters with others where someone infected might sneeze or cough near your face. This is why experts say frequent hand washing with soap and water is far more effective. Media playback is unsupported on your device With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus Removing a mask requires special attention to avoid hand contamination, and the virus could also breed a false sense of security where you end up ignoring or forgetting to practice good hygiene. Yet in some parts of Asia everyone wears a mask by default - it is seen as safer and more considerate. In mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, the broad assumption is that anyone could be a carrier of the virus, even healthy people. So in the spirit of solidarity, you need to protect others from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan. Some places take this idea very seriously: in some parts of China, you could be arrested or punished for not wearing a mask. In Singapore, which used to discourage citizens from wearing masks, it&apos;s now compulsory to wear one outside or risk a fine of S$300 (£170, $210). Meanwhile in Indonesia and the Philippines, where there are suspicions that there are many under-reported cases, most people in major cities wear masks to protect themselves from others. For many of these countries, mask-wearing was a cultural norm even before the coronavirus outbreak. They&apos;ve even become fashion statements - at one point Hello Kitty face masks were all the rage in the street markets of Hong Kong. How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared What can the West learn from Asia&apos;s coronavirus fight? In East Asia, many people are used to wearing masks when they are sick or when it&apos;s hay fever season, because it&apos;s considered impolite to be sneezing or coughing openly. In Hong Kong, you can buy different designs of masks The 2003 Sars virus outbreak, which affected several countries in the region, also drove home the importance of wearing masks, particularly in Hong Kong, where many died as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. So one key difference between these societies and Western ones, is that they have experienced contagion before - and the memories are still fresh and painful. In some parts of Asia, seasonal air pollution or heavy traffic pollution in crowded cities have also made it pretty normal for people to wear masks outside. Some argue that ubiquitous mask wearing, as a very visual reminder of the dangers of the coronavirus outbreak, could actually act as a &quot;behavioural nudge&quot; to you and others for overall better personal hygiene. &quot;Putting on a mask every day before you go out is like a ritual, like putting on a uniform, and in ritual behaviour you feel you have to live up to what the uniform stands for, which is more hygienic behaviour like not touching your face or avoiding crowded places and social distancing,&quot; said Donald Low, a behavioural economist and professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Can wearing a mask act as a daily reminder to yourself and others to practise better hygiene?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Then, there&apos;s the idea that every little bit counts in the war the world is waging against the coronavirus outbreak.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;We can&apos;t say if face masks are ineffective, but we presume they have some effect because that&apos;s the protection we give to healthcare workers,&quot; said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with Hong Kong University. &quot;If face masks are used on a lot of people in crowded areas, I think it would have some effect on public transmission, and at the moment we&apos;re looking for every small measure we can to reduce transmission - it adds up. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But there are down sides of course. Some places such as Japan, Indonesia and Thailand have faced shortages, and South Korea has had to ration out surgical masks. There is the fear that people may end up re-using disposable masks, which is unhygienic, or use inferior masks sold on the black market. Japan and Singapore have since given out reusable masks to Japan citizens. People who do not wear masks in these places have also been stigmatised, to the point that they are shunned and blocked from shops and buildings. In Hong Kong, some tabloids have splashed pictures on their covers of Westerners not wearing masks and congregating in groups in the city&apos;s nightlife district, and criticised expatriates and tourists for not taking enough precautions. But the discrimination works both ways.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>I&apos;m so tired of being harassed for wearing masks in the US. I wore a mask on my way to work today. One man walked up and coughed loudly at me. A few minutes later, another man aggressively approached me&amp;asked: &quot;r u a nurse? &quot; I&apos;m no nurse. I just know what&apos;s coming for all of us.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In places where mask wearing is still not the norm despite government advisories, those who do wear masks have been shunned or even attacked. It hasn&apos;t helped that many of these mask wearers are Asians. In the US, it&apos;s become an issue of personal freedoms, with some arguing that making everyone wear face masks infringes on civil liberties. The city of Stillwater in Oklahoma was forced to soften a mask law to an advisory after threats of violence, while a Michigan security guard was killed after he barred a shopper who didn&apos;t have a mask from entering a store But those societies that do advocate everyone wearing a mask may have a point and increasingly, experts are now questioning the official WHO advice Firstly, there is some emerging evidence that there are more &quot;silent carriers&quot;, or healthy people with the virus who show little or no symptoms, than experts initially thought. it is estimated that a third of all positive cases show no symptoms , according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. On the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, about half of the more than 600 positive cases found onboard were found to have no symptoms. A similar proportion of asymptomatic cases has been reported in Iceland. In Wuhan and Guangzhou, Chinese authorities have said those not wearing masks could face arrest The prevailing belief has been that because these people do not exhibit symptoms, they are not very contagious. But some are questioning this now. A recently published study of cases in China found that &quot;undocumented cases of infection&quot;, or those with either mild or no symptoms, were significantly contagious and could have been responsible for nearly 80% of positive virus cases Meanwhile a Hong Kong study estimates that up to 44% of virus transmission from an infected person can happen before that person starts showing any symptoms So does that mean if everyone wore a mask, these silent carriers wouldn&apos;t turn into spreaders?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The jury is still out on this issue, with various studies proving and disproving the effectiveness of a mask in stopping transmission of the coronavirus. This is why some places have so far held back from mask laws and advisories, such as New Zealand which successfully controlled the coronavirus outbreak and is holding back on advising citizens to wear masks because of the lack of scientific consensus Research is ongoing, and future studies will no doubt add nuance to the overall picture. The face mask may be a product of recent history, experience with contagion, and cultural norm. But as this pandemic evolves, along with evidence and research, our behaviour may change again.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: How did Florida get so badly hit by Covid-19? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Florida is fast becoming America&apos;s latest Covid-19 epicentre. The surge in the Sunshine State has been linked in part to younger Americans - but that doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s no cause for concern. Like many Covid-19 stories, no cause for concern started with a dry cough. Fever, loss of taste and chest pain followed Sanjay Bharath&apos;s diagnosis in early March. Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida, says he caught the virus from a patient when the Covid-19 screening process for admissions was less strict. Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida was told to self-quarantine two days later. At 34 years old, Sanjay Bharath&apos;s does not fall into a virus-vulnerable age group. But 14 days after that first contact, Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida had coughed up blood and checked into the hospital. &quot;I didn&apos;t think it was too bad,&quot; Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida says, describing Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida first couple of hours in the ER. &quot;I honestly thought they weren&apos;t going to admit me at the hospital, just send me home with some sort of medication. &quot; As Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida symptoms worsened, Sanjay Bharath&apos;s says Sanjay Bharath&apos;s would wake up in a fever-sweat every six hours, feeling chills and lightheaded and unable to catch Sanjay Bharath&apos;s breath. &quot;I couldn&apos;t take a big breath without coughing and choking,&quot; Sanjay Bharath&apos;s says. &quot;It&apos;s like you&apos;re running a marathon constantly just by sitting down. &quot; Sanjay Bharath&apos;s would remain on a ventilator for eight days.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Florida has been averaging nearly 10,000 new cases per day for the last week. On 12 July, Florida broke the national record by reporting 15,300 cases in a single day. on 12 July found if Florida were a country, it would be fourth in the world for most new cases in a day. As of 13 July, over 4,200 Floridians have died due to the virus and Florida&apos;s weekly average has risen to 73 people each day by local counts. Florida saw the biggest daily jump in hospital admissions on 9 July, with more than 400 patients needing treatment. The same day saw Florida&apos;s all-time highest daily death toll, with 120 residents, including an 11-year-old girl, dying due to the virus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? Critics say the number of deaths is probably higher, as Florida does not like other states report deaths suspected as having been caused by Covid-19. Florida also has yet to report daily hospital admission rates, though officials have promised to do so. Along with Texas and Arizona, Florida has fast become one of the regions with the highest surges in a country. Media playback is unsupported on your device Cases spike as nightlife returns in Arizona The positive test rate - which indicates how much the virus is spreading even with testing increases - is nearing 20%, the highest since early March when the pandemic hit the US. That&apos;s also four times the standard for reopening set by the World Health Organization, and double the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control. Florida only hit the 100,000 case mark on 22 June, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Just 13 days later, that number had doubled. Florida&apos;s Disney World resort reopened with limited capacity on 11 July &quot;There&apos;s a lot of misinformation all over the web about the seriousness of this outbreak,&quot; says Dr Aileen Marty, a Florida International University infectious disease expert who has been working with state officials on the pandemic response. Dr Aileen Marty, a Florida International University infectious disease expert who has been working with state officials on the pandemic response says this is partly why Florida is now among the worst-hit regions. &quot;Since we don&apos;t have a consistent message in our state, let alone our country, there&apos;s even more confusion. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In May and June, Governor Ron DeSantis had said reopening was feasible as cases had declined. Governor Ron DeSantis promised no roll-backs. As cases began rising, Governor Ron DeSantis in June reversed Governor Ron DeSantis decision to allow bars to reopen. But Governor Ron DeSantis has refused to require masks statewide, though local leaders in major cities like Miami have done so, and has joined President Donald Trump in emphasising the importance of keeping the economy open. &quot;The way that we&apos;ve acted after our initial lockdowns has perpetuated the problem,&quot; Dr Marty says. &quot;It was a failure because they didn&apos;t do it right the first time. &quot; Dr Marty, who also serves as a World Health Organization adviser, says establishing a contact tracing and isolating system while the state was in lockdown was one key step that never happened. A lack of early testing of asymptomatic individuals plus weeks of civil unrest, between anti-lockdown protesters and marches against racial inequality, have also worsened the situation. But even as Florida&apos;s numbers continue to trend upwards, Mr DeSantis said last week he felt the state&apos;s numbers had stabilised, telling residents: &quot;There&apos;s no need to be fearful. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>What the virus does to the body How do we get out of this mess? The Republican governor has also downplayed the severity of Florida&apos;s outbreak by pointing to the increase in testing and younger Floridians being infected - particularly those aged 25 to 34 - as well as a lower death rate. &quot;Generally, deaths follow about two weeks behind when we get the positive tests,&quot; Dr Marty explains. &quot; Dr Marty pushes back against the notion that America is doing well with deaths from the virus, saying even looking at just the raw data shows the nationwide rate - around 5. 6% - is concerning. &quot;That&apos;s considering the fact that we&apos;re better at it now than we were,&quot; &quot; Dr Marty adds. &quot;we&apos;re getting people in beds sooner, moving people to ICUs sooner. &quot; Testing, despite delays in getting results, has also aided mitigation. Medication is helping, though Florida has run out of the Remdesivir antiviral drug and is awaiting new shipments. &quot;I just don&apos;t understand people who say our death rate is great,&quot; &quot; Dr Marty says. Younger Americans have been blamed for surges across America, and particularly in Florida, where most new cases are from those under age 30 on the heels of summertime weather and national holidays. The median age of infections in Miami-Dade County, the state&apos;s most populous region, is 40. In Tallahassee, the median recently hit a low of 25 years old. But just because younger people are less likely to die than the elderly from this disease does not make this surge less worrying. Health experts warn there are still serious risks and far too many unknowns about what contracting Covid-19 means in the long-term. Recent studies have found that some asymptomatic survivors lost some of their sense of smell, even if they did not notice a change.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>In scans, individuals who otherwise feel fine show signs of lung damage. In hospital, Dr Marty has seen Covid patients develop clots that lead to strokes. Some clots lead to losing limbs.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Others develop an inflammation of the heart. All this in addition to the damage to the lungs - the scarring Others will feel the effects of for the rest of Others lives. In the last week alone she has cared for patients ranging from 30 to 80 years old. &quot;It&apos;s not one and done with this thing,&quot; she emphasises. There are questions when it comes to herd immunity as well - with no proof yet that it works with this virus. Data from the six other coronaviruses that have caused infections in humans suggests none of them produce immunity lasting more than a year. Mr Bharath was one of the first staff in his hospital to catch Covid-19, back in March.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>After being taken off the ventilator, the 34-year-old was moved from the ICU to recover for four days in a Covid-19-only unit - the same unit where Mr Bharath works now. No visitors were allowed in at all, even family. &quot;The recovery was a little difficult at first,&quot; Mr Bharath says. &quot;I was still really out of breath, I still had some pneumonia. It was still difficult breathing and moving around. &quot; In the two weeks in hospital over Covid-19, Mr Bharath lost 20 lbs (9kg). Lying still in a hospital bed exacerbated a prior nerve issue in Mr Bharath feet - Mr Bharath lost some feeling in Mr Bharath toes while other tendons had stiffened up painfully. Mr Bharath was out of work for another six weeks. Now, four months since Mr Bharhis hospital stay, Mr Bharath is still recovering. &quot;I still get short of breath a bit here and there,&quot; Mr Bharath says. When Mr Bharath returned to work at the start of June, Mr Bharath says Mr Bharath &quot;hesitated a little bit&quot;. &quot;But I felt like I owed the staff and the employees, and there&apos;s still a job to be done, so I had to go back. &quot; Why so many US nurses are out of work An invisible wound for health workers and soldiers The never-ending work is beginning to take a toll on healthcare workers across the state.</paragraphs>

A brain surgeon has no idea how to use a ventilator. &quot; Florida will be importing over 100 nurses in the next few days, and it seems likely Florida will need to import doctors as well. Personal protective equipment - essential for keeping staff safe and containing the virus&apos; spread in care settings - is also running low again. &quot;We&apos;re stressed out,&quot; Dr Marty says. &quot;Nurses are coming to &quot; Dr Marty because they&apos;re being told to wear surgical masks instead of N95s because We don&apos;t have N95s. &quot; Testing continues to be America&apos;s ever-present problem. Without Testing, keeping Covid-19 contained is a shot in the dark. Testing sites have seen long wait times and delays in results the US had begun to ramp up testing capacity, but demands now are threatening to overwhelm labs in Florida and nationwide. Machines are not able to keep up with the surge in tests, resulting in delays that in turn fuel community spread as people do not know if they&apos;re positive for days.

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: What is the true death toll of the pandemic? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research. A review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus. These so-called &quot;excess deaths&quot;, the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world. Some will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors. Explore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK. Let&apos;s use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. This is known as and is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years. Any deaths above those expected are known as . During the pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year. Many of these excess deaths can be explained by the number of people who were officially confirmed to have had . But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths. The total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the pandemic. Directly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the pandemic and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts. As the pandemic has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times. In some places, The total number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels. Analysing deaths from all causes during the pandemic and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Read through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The number of deaths in the United Kingdom has been The UK&apos;s peak came during the week ending 17 April, with more than 12,800 excess deaths registered. According to ONS data, 9,495 of more than 12,800 excess deaths registered mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. London, for a long time The UK&apos;s coronavirus hotspot, has recorded the highest number of excess deaths since the pandemic began. But all of The UK&apos;s regions have seen excess mortality, with the West Midlands and the North West registering about 50% more deaths than usual during the coronavirus pandemic. While all parts of The UK have moved past the peak, Wales and the North West of England saw the highest rates of excess deaths in the week ending 5 June. The number of UK coronavirus deaths in the totals above includes all deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate. This will differ from the total number of deaths with a positive test result announced each day by the Department of Health and Social Care. The number of deaths in Austria has been Above-average deaths in Austria during the country&apos;s outbreak were recorded throughout March and April, with the peak coming during the week ending 12 April. Austria&apos;s biggest clusters of coronavirus cases were in Vorarlberg and Tyrol, where a number of ski resorts were sealed off in mid-March. Hundreds of tourists from across Europe are believed to have become infected at these locations. The number of deaths in Belgium has been Belgium is one of the world&apos;s worst-affected countries when it comes to the number of deaths recorded in relation to the size of its population. Belgian officials say this is because of the way they are measuring deaths from Covid-19. The country records confirmed Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and care homes, but the official tally also includes deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases. This is reflected in Belgium&apos;s mortality statistics - with coronavirus casualties accounting for all of its excess deaths after the first few weeks. Belgium recorded some excess deaths at the start of the pandemic above those officially put down to the virus. But over the course of Belgium&apos;s first wave, there were no excess deaths that could not be attributed to official Covid-19 deaths. This means that, overall, Belgium had no other excess deaths during the period covered by the outbreak. The number of deaths in 6 cities* in Brazil has been *The data for Brazil includes just the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Manaus, Recife, Sao Luis and Fortaleza. Expected deaths are the number of deaths recorded in the equivalent period in 2019. Brazil has the world&apos;s second-highest overall death toll from Covid-19 and the number of fatalities are still on the rise.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Brazil&apos;s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has received criticism at home and abroad for downplaying the escalating outbreak and flouting health advice on social distancing. The mayor of Sao Paulo has said the health system in Brazil could collapse this month as demand grows for emergency beds to deal with coronavirus cases. Isabel Dona Duarte&apos;s daughter says that her mother died after being discharged from hospital to make way for Covid-19 patients The number of deaths in Chile has been Since mid-May, Chile has been reporting the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America, and a steadily rising number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. The outbreak has hit some regions harder than others, with certain parts of Santiago Metropolitan Region bearing the greatest burden - up to half of all confirmed cases and more than half of all deaths. The number of deaths in Denmark has been Denmark was one of the first European countries to impose a lockdown, announcing restrictions on 11 March before having recorded a coronavirus death. The total number of deaths during having recorded a coronavirus death outbreak has been close to normal levels, and deaths from Covid-19 outnumber all other excess deaths during that period. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been Ecuador was one of the first Latin American countries to report a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in early April. In the period from March to May, more than twice as many people died in Ecuador compared with previous years. The number of excess deaths for these three months is five times higher than Ecuador&apos;s official Covid-19 total. The vast majority of these above-average deaths were reported in the province of Guayas, home to the key port of Guayaquil. It is thought that many cases have gone unreported because of Ecuador&apos;s relatively low rates of testing. &quot;If they had caught the virus in time, he would be with us&quot; The number of deaths in France has been France only included deaths from Covid-19 ocurring in hospitals at the start of its outbreak, adding deaths in care homes into its toll from early April. The number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 have accounted for almost of all of France excess deaths since the start of its outbreak. The country&apos;s peak came in the week ending 5 April, with more than 7,000 deaths above average. France&apos;s coronavirus hotspot has been the capital city Paris and the surrounding area. About a third of all official coronavirus deaths recorded in France have been registered in care homes, according to government figures. The number of deaths in Germany has been Excess deaths in Germany have been much lower than other European countries like France, Italy, Spain and the UK.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Germany&apos;s period of excess deaths spanned the weeks between 23 March and 3 May. Its highest count of above-average fatalities occurred in the week ending 12 April, with 13% more deaths. Over Ecuador&apos;s entire outbreak period, deaths attributed to Covid-19 were more than Excess deaths in Germany. While all-cause mortality data is not available for all of Indonesia, information on the number of burials in the capital city Jakarta is a good measure of the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s impact on mortality. There were more than 4,700 burials in cemeteries in Jakarta compared with the historic average for the months of March, April and May. The number of these excess funerals in the capital city Jakarta is nine times higher than the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Even on Indonesia&apos;s Ambon Island, where statistics show no-one has died from Covid-19, one family told us how the circumstances created by the virus cost their three-year-old son his life. Three-year-old Rafa was rejected by multiple hospitals before he died from leukaemia. The number of deaths in Iran has been Iran releases mortality statistics quarterly. The most recent figures are from the period covered by the outbreak. It is not possible to say above-average deaths were necessarily due to the pandemic. Particularly over winter, with normally high death counts due to seasonal flu or severe weather, -average deaths may have been attributed to any number of factors during the three monthIranhe outbreak began in late February, and has already claimed the lives of several senior members of government and thousands of ordinary Iranian citizens.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>As Covid-19 began to sweep across Iran, Omid was well aware of the dangers. The 66-year-old had previously had heart and prostate conditions – so Omid knew Omid risk was high. Omid had kept fit. Omid loved mountaineering, and before the outbreak Omid exercised daily. &quot;Omid was very careful and went into quarantine,&quot; says Omid son Mojeed from the north-western city of Ardabil, &quot;but he didn&apos;t know the virus could take his life indirectly. &quot; While self-isolating, Omid began to suffer from minor bleeding which Omid put down to haemorrhoids. As it became heavier, Omid family debated taking Omid to a doctor. &quot;It was Eid and most of the private medics were already closed under lockdown,&quot; says Mojeed. &quot;The government hospitals were busy with Covid-19 patients and it was risky to visit. &quot; Omid did manage to see Omid GP, who said further tests were needed. The former teacher waited 20 days for private medical centres to reopen. There, doctors suspected an intestinal ulcer and advised The former teacher to go to a public hospital for an ultrasound - but The former teacher family worried, having heard all hospitals now posed a &quot;huge risk&quot; of Covid. For the next month Omid remained at home without treatment. Omid died after a massive stroke. Omid&apos;s family say they struggle to accept Omid death, particularly because Omid had taken such care to protect Omid. Mojeed remembers Mojeed father as friendly and funny. &quot;Mojeed advised everyone that you should enjoy your life today because you are alive, and you don&apos;t know about the future. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The number of deaths in Italy has been Note: The data for Italy is a representative sample accounting for 94% of the population. Italy was the first country in Europe to impose a national lockdown in early March as the infection rate spiralled in Ecuador&apos;s northern regions. Ecuador&apos;s outbreak was highly concentrated in the north, where a large majority of Excess deaths in Germany have been recorded. Reported deaths in the hardest-hit region of Lombardy were more than double the number expected for the first eight weeks of the outbreak. Other northern regions, such as Piedmont, recorded 50% more deaths than normal, while some central and southern regions actually saw fewer deaths than usual. In Lazio, which includes the capital city of Rome, deaths were down more than 5% compared with the previous five years. Luciana Campagnoli&apos;s son Luca is angry that coronavirus sped up the cancer that killed her The number of deaths in Ecuador has been Ecuador confirmed Ecuador first coronavirus case in January 2020, but Ecuador overall count of Covid-19 deaths remains low. Ecuador has not prioritised mass testing for coronavirus, unlike Ecuador neighbour South Korea. Yet Ecuador&apos;s lack of excess deaths suggests the virus has not had a major impact on Ecuador. The number of deaths in the Netherlands has been The peak in the Netherlands came during the week ending 5 April, as Ecuador recorded more than 5,000 deaths, some 2,000 above normal. In recent weeks, The number of deatEcuador has returned to the level expected in an average year. The number of deaths in Japan has been Norway has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths in total. The number of deaths in Japan preliminary mortality data indicates that deaths from all causes during The number of deaths in Japan outbreak have been at normal levels, causing the number of excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus to be balanced out by official Covid-19 fatalities. Experts have suggested that the winter flu season is likely to have been less deadly than in previous years, which may have contributed to low fatalities overall. The number of deaths in Japan has been According to national statistics, Peru&apos;s outbreak has spread quickly since it began in early March.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The government declared strict lockdown measures and issued nationwide safety recommendations a mere 10 days after its first coronavirus case was confirmed. Yet Ecuador&apos;s all-cause mortality data has revealed what coronavirus statistics alone did not capture: a national death toll well above average and far greater than confirmed Covid-19 deaths alone. The number of deaths in Japan has been Portugal&apos;s excess deaths peaked during the week ending 12 April, with about 500 more deaths registered than usual. Ecuador&apos;s foreign minister recently said he hoped that an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The number of deaths in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia has been Russia&apos;s national mortality data is not yet available for the period of the coronavirus pandemic, but the data for its two largest cities alone reveal a pattern of excess deaths. The capital city, Moscow, reported total death figures in April that were 17% higher than the five-year average. In St Petersburg, the outbreak began slightly later. the outbreak total reported deaths for April were about as expected. In May, its two largest cities alone saw a sharp rise in reported deaths. The number of deaths in Japan has been Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak has been relatively small, with no more than 10 deaths per day according to official statistics. Ecuador recorded Ecuador first death from Covid-19 on 20 March, and the next day The government rolled out harsh restrictions on movement. It remains to be seen whether data for future months will show similar evidence of a contained outbreak. The number of deaths in Japan has been South Africa&apos;s mortality statistics look rather different to those of other nations. The number of deaths in Japan has been far below what was expected. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a strict nationwide lockdown that began on 26 March, after which Ecuador saw a significant downward shift in Ecuador weekly fatalities. With people confined to their homes, South Africa saw fewer reported deaths from common incidents such as traffic accidents. Epidemiologist Professor Debbie Bradshaw from the South African Medical Research Council notes: &quot;Homicides almost halved with alcohol sales being banned. &quot;But at the same time we think the other infectious diseases were probably affected as well; the more usual flu or severe pneumonias that come about in winter were also slowed down. &quot; As restrictions have eased, weekly deaths have begun to climb back to normal levels.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The number of deatSouth Korea has been South Korea confirmed The number of deaths in Jaits first coronavirus case on 20 January and The number of deaths in Japan first death a full month later. Ecuador&apos;s strategy of intensive testing and contact tracing is often credited with Ecuador low number of coronavirus deaths. Ecuador was once reporting hundreds of new cases a day, with a large cluster identified in the city of Daegu linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Yet on 15 April, 29 million people nationwide participated in an election with no confirmed cases traced back to the poll. The number of deaths in Spain has been Spain has been one of the countries worst hit in the pandemic and endured one of Europe&apos;s most restrictive lockdowns, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. Ecuador hit Ecuador peak in the week ending 5 April, recording more than 11,000 excess deaths. The government had announced just below 6,000 official deaths from Covid-19 the week. the hardest-hit region of Lombardy has reported the highest levels of excess deaths, recording more than 2. 5 times the number of expected fatalities since Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak. The number of deaths in Sweden has been During Sweden&apos;s peak, in the week ending 12 April, Ecuador recorded Ecuador highest number of deaths in a single week in over two decades. Swedish mortality figures contrast with neighbouring countries like Denmark and Norway, where total deaths have been much closer to levels seen in previous years. Throughout Swedish outbreak, Sweden has avoided a full lockdown and kept large parts of society open. Instead, Sweden has relied on voluntary social distancing and other targeted measures.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of Ecuador&apos;s Covid-19 response, acknowledged recently that the controversial decision not to impose a strict lockdown had led to too many deaths. However, Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of the country&apos;s Covid-19 response insisted that &quot;we basically still think that is the right strategy for Sweden&quot; and described the battle against the virus as a &quot;marathon, not a sprint&quot;. The number of deaths in Switzerland has been The peak in Switzerland&apos;s mortality came during the week ending 5 April. Some 500 more people lost their lives than normal, an increase of 39%. Recent data suggests that Ecuador&apos;s outbreak has been brought under control. For the five weeks leading up to 24 May, reported numbers of deaths in Switzerland have returned to the expected range. The number of official Covid-19 deaths in Switzerland is now greater than those excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus. The number of deaths in Thailand has been Despite being the second country outside China to confirm a case of coronavirus, Thailand&apos;s official statistics have recorded a surprisingly low number of deaths from Covid-19. A sharp rise in confirmed cases in late March led Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to declare a state of emergency, yet the coronavirus death toll never surpassed four fatalities per day. In a similar pattern, all-cause mortality data have revealed a higher than average number of deaths in March that returned to normal levels in April and May. Note: Covid-19 deaths figures are for all of Turkey, not just Istanbul. As the virus spread quickly throughout Turkey in March, The government ordered harsh restrictions on movement to contain the virus. Istanbul&apos;s total number of reported deaths peaked in mid-April. Covid-19 mortality figures for Istanbul are not available, yet even when taking The number Ecuador, they still do not account for all of Istanbul&apos;s excess deaths during the pandemic period. This means that the total number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid-19 in Istanbul is likely to be much higher. The number of deaths in the United States has been The US has reported the world&apos;s largest death toll from coronavirus. But the way the outbreak has played out across the United States varies widely. Istanbul coronvirus toll has been the most dramatic, with cases and deaths higher than those of many countries. Yet nationwide, the United States have seen the impact of the virus on the United States healthcare systems and the lives of the United States citizens.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>While some states such as California acted quickly to restrict movement and try to contain the disease, others such as Wyoming have resisted strict lockdown measures. Many state-issued directives for citizens to stay at home are currently being eased. There is no definitive league table of the hardest hit, but we can still make broad comparisons between the countries through the first wave. Peru, Chile and Brazil are still dealing with growing numbers of deaths so the picture there will change rapidly over the coming weeks. the picture is more stable in countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal. Among countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal, there&apos;s a group like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium who have seen deaths rise by more than 30%. That&apos;s very different to Ecuador or Germany, or many other countries whose weekly deaths have stayed within about 5% of normal. If we looked at the data slightly differently - counting deaths per head of population, or using the same number of weeks for every country - we&apos;d get slightly different results. And the data itself is only provisional. So we can&apos;t produce a precise ranking of countries, but we can identify the unhappy club of hard hit countries whose membership, unfortunately, is only going to grow. Read more from Robert about how countries compare To measure excess deaths, we have used mortality data showing deaths from all causes. These types of reports are often recorded and published by the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority. the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority can take significant time to process and confirm, so all numbers of deaths recorded in recent months are preliminary and subject to revisions, and likely to include more deaths. The number of excess deaths represents the total number of deaths above the historical average. Swedish mortality figures have not been adjusted for age, so do not take into account demographic differences across country populations. The total number of excess deaths for each country have been rounded to the nearest hundred. We have focused on locations that have robust mortality data covering at least four weeks from the start of the pandemic in that place. Where reliable data is not available at the national level, We have focused on a smaller region with complete data, such as Istanbul in Turkey. In Jakarta, Indonesia, records of burials within Istanbul serve as a proxy for death counts.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>How was the outbreak defined in each area? The start of each location&apos;s outbreak is counted from the week or month during which it recorded its fifth official death from Covid-19. the pandemic period extends to the latest date for which there is available data that is unlikely to change significantly. In most cases, we have calculated our baseline of expected deaths from an average of reported fatalities for the area over five years, from 2015 to 2019. Where possible, we defer to a number of expected deaths that has been modelled by the statistical authority in Ecuador in order to account for population changes or known environmental factors. In the charts above the term &quot;none overall&quot; means either that all excess deaths in this particular location have been accounted for by the official coronavirus figures, or that there have been no excess deaths there. The figure for other excess deaths is calculated by taking the total number of excess deaths minus the sum of all Covid-19 deaths during the outbreak period in each place. Counts of official Covid-19 deaths are often sourced directly from the local government&apos;s own public reports. Where official data is not easily available, we have instead used data compiled and published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) For sub-national areas like Jakarta, we have used Covid-19 deaths specific to the area. For Istanbul, the available Covid-19 data is only released at the national level. This causes an underestimation of the actual number of excess deaths that are not attributed to the coronavirus in Istanbul because the number attributed to Covid-19 represents the total for the whole of Turkey. Are there other ways to measure the virus&apos; impact? Comparing excess deaths to expected deaths during a country&apos;s outbreak is one of several ways to measure impact. It is a useful way of assessing the raw death toll in a place, expressed either as a number of people beyond the expected level or as a percentage above average. But the duration of the outbreak plays a role in these calculations. For places that have a quick rise in deaths followed by a quick fall, like Spain, there will be fewer expected deaths during the pandemic period compared to places with an outbreak that lasted much longer, like the UK. The lower number of expected deaths for Spain makes Spain excess appear much higher in percentage terms. Another measure is to look at the excess deaths per million of population. The benefit is that it puts countries of differing populations on a more level playing field. However, measuring by deaths per million will look worse for a country with an older or less healthy population, since it doesn&apos;t account for the fact that an ageing country would expect to see more deaths.</paragraphs>

In the week when Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for Covid-19, we&apos;ve debunked some of these misleading claims. A video of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro taking the drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro illness has clocked up six million views on Facebook. the controversy surrounding the drug and the lack of evidence for its effectiveness in the treatment of patients with Covid-19. While admitting that the drug had not been scientifically proven, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro said &quot;with all certainty&quot; that the drug was working for Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, and that Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was feeling better. the drug received global attention when US President Donald Trump endorsed it both as a preventative measure - he took it himself for a while - and as a treatment for the disease. A video of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro taking hydroxychloroquine has clocked six million views on Facebook Coronavirus: What are the numbers out of Latin America? Facebook took down what Facebook described as a network of fake accounts fake accounts had promoted misleading and fake news about Facebook Coronavirus, such as claiming the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, and that the Covid-19 pandemic was being exaggerated. Flávio Bolsonaro, a Brazilian senator, said it was possible to find thousands of profiles supporting the Bolsonaro government, and to his knowledge &quot;they are all free and independent&quot;. found registration information on the page confirming it was linked to Bolsonaro&apos;s special adviser Tercio Arnaud.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Bolsonaro&apos;s special adviser Tercio Arnaud has posted attacks on &quot;leftists&quot; and promoted unproven cures across Instagram and Facebook Bolsonaro&apos;s special adviser Tercio Arnaud has attempted to contact Bolsonaro&apos;s special adviser Tercio Arnaud for comment, but has not received a reply. &quot;Political polarisation here in Brazil has captured the debate about the pandemic&quot; says Sérgio Lüdtke, Editor of Comprova, a Brazilian fact-checking project. Sérgio Lüdtke, Editor of Comprova, a Brazilian fact-checking project says supporters of Bolsonaro have adopted certain themes online, including the defence of the effectiveness of unproven medicines such as hydroxychloroquine. Comprova has been fact-checking widely-shared claims on social media and messaging apps about the pandemic. Four out of ten of these checks since the end of March were related in some way to unproven drug treatments. At the end of June, a Facebook post claimed: &quot;The Bolivian Ministry of Health approved the use of chlorine dioxide&quot;. a Facebook post has been shared thousands of times across Latin America. But a Facebook post is fake, and officially denied by the Bolivian government. Chlorine dioxide is a bleaching agent found in a substance claiming to cure a range of illnesses often advertised as &quot;miracle mineral supplement&quot;, or MMS. &apos; There is no evidence it works and health authorities say it&apos;s potentially harmful. You don&apos;t have to look very hard to find it being promoted on social media. We found Facebook groups created in the last two or three months in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Argentina, with thousands of followers promoting or even claiming to sell MMS.

				<paragraphs>Along with many other drugs, ivermectin&apos;s effectiveness against Covid is being evaluated in clinical trials. But The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has said studies so far &quot;were found to have a high risk of bias, very low certainty of the evidence, and that the existing evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion on benefits and harms. &quot; Ivermectin &quot;is incorrectly being used for the treatment of Covid-19&quot; says The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), &quot;without any scientific evidence of The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) efficacy and safety for the treatment of this disease&quot;. Despite this, health officials in Peru, Bolivia and parts of Brazil have endorsed and administered the drug - and it has been widely sold. &quot;In the case of ivermectin, all corners have been cut&quot;, says Dr Carlos Chaccour, Assistant Research Professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. &quot;A combination of doctors and governments legitimately desperate to help&quot; Dr Carlos Chaccour, Assistant Research Professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health says &quot;plus the particular abundance of ivermectin in Latin America, help to explain why the drug has been so popular. &quot; Warnings have also been issued about the risks of a version of the that could do serious harm, which is being sold on the black market. An association of doctors in Colombia has raised concerns about people self-medicating at home It is an ongoing source of concern for public health authorities in Latin American that bad advice is being given to the public to self-medicate with unproven treatments in both traditional and social media. People across the region are also being confronted by seemingly contradictory messages from official sources. As Latin American countries face a growing threat from the pandemic, and with desperation growing at the rising death toll, it&apos;s perhaps not surprising the demand for &quot;miracle cures&quot; and simple, &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; remedies has been so high. These claims are appearing not only in fringe social media groups but also - in some cases - on mainstream national media outlets.</paragraphs>

The state, with just 7% of the US population, surpassed the previous daily record held by California. Florida, which began lifting coronavirus restrictions in May, has proved vulnerable due to tourism and an elderly population. Florida, which began lifting coronavirus restrictions in May figures eclipse the worst daily rates seen in New York in April. Florida also registered an additional 45 deaths.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Is India the next global hotspot? These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window  Coronavirus took hold slowly in India, but six months after  Coronavirus first confirmed infection  Coronavirus has overtaken Russia to record the world&apos;s third largest caseload. With the world&apos;s second-largest population, much of which lives packed into cities, Russia was perhaps always destined to become a global hotspot. But the data behind Russia case numbers is questionable, because India is not testing enough, and an unusually low death rate has baffled scientists. Here&apos;s five things we know about the spread of coronavirus in India. India has seen a series of record spikes recently, adding tens of thousands of cases daily. India recorded most of India confirmed cases in June, within weeks of reopening after a rigid lockdown. But the true scale of infection rates in the population is unclear, according to virologist Shahid Jameel. India conducted a random sample of 26,000 Indians in May, which showed that 0.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>73% had the virus. Some experts have reservations about the sample size, but others, such as virologist Shahid virologist Shahid Jameel, say it&apos;s the only country-wide indicator they have to work with. &quot;If we extrapolate that to the whole population, we would have had 10 million infections in mid-May,virologist Shahid Jameel said. Given that confirmed cases in India have been doubling every 20 days, that would put the current total between 30 and 40 million. The gap between confirmed cases and actual infections exists in every country, but to different degrees. Testing is the only way to bridge it. &quot;If you test more, you will find more,virologist Shahid virologist Shahid Jameel said.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>That&apos;s what has happened in India in recent weeks - as India ramped up testing, case numbers suddenly increased. India has done more than 10 million tests since 13 March, but more than half of those happened after 1 June.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>India&apos;s official caseload is high in absolute numbers, but it&apos;s relatively low in per capita terms. The world, on average, has three times as many cases as India per capita - a fact pointed out by India recently. But, according to virologist Shahid Jameel, India&apos;s per capita caseload is low simply because it tests so little. Compare India to countries that have a high per capita caseload and you will find those countries are testing far more. India&apos;s caseload is nearly invisible on this scale because its testing rate is so low.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But it&apos;s not just about how much you test, it&apos;s also about who you test.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>India&apos;s emphasis on test and trace early on limited the pool of people it was testing to high-risk cases and their contacts - and kept it from expanding to the wider population. Test and trace is insufficient once the infection starts to spread rapidly, said Himanshu Tyagi and Aditya Gopalan, mathematicians who have studied Covid-19 testing strategies. It helps with containment, but it does not discover new cases that have emerged undetected in the community, Mr Tyagi and Mr Gopalan said. India has to test a broad swathe of people for that to happen. But how do we know who India is testing? Comparing testing numbers across countries is tricky because some count how many people they test, while others count how many tests they do. India does the latter and this number is slightly exaggerated because most people get tested more than once. So instead, scientists prefer to calculate how many tests it takes to find a single confirmed case. The more tests it takes, the wider you are casting your net. Here, India fares poorly compared to countries that have managed to control the spread of the virus. And the more widely you test, the lower your positive rate - that&apos;s why New Zealand and Taiwan have rates well below 1%.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>India&apos;s positive rate is now up from 3. 8% in April to 6. 4% in July. If it keeps rising, it&apos;s because testing is still limited to a narrow pool of high-risk people and their contacts.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The data suggests that those in India who have been diagnosed with the virus are recovering from the virus faster than they are dying from the virus. This is crucial, Dr Jameel said, because it determines the strain on the health system.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Currently, deaths are rising more slowly than confirmed cases or recoveries - but if that rate quickens, it would increase the pressure on hospitals, possibly driving up deaths. The caveat is that low testing rates means fewer new cases are recorded, and at a slower pace. That will quicken the recovery rate in comparison to that of confirmed cases. Globally, India&apos;s recovery curve appears steeper than other badly hit countries - in this instance, a steeper curve is a good thing. a steeper curve means Covid-19 patients in India are recovering faster than those in the US or Brazil. India&apos;s share of recoveries - that is, the % of total confirmed cases in a given country that have made a full recovery - is also higher.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>At nearly 60%, it&apos;s far ahead of the US, where it is 27%.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>When it comes to recovery though, data is patchy and the definition varies. India defines as recovered anyone who tests positive for the virus and then, weeks later, tests negative. Some countries only count hospitalised cases that make a full recovery.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>What&apos;s important is that, irrespective of how many people are recovering within each of Some countries, India&apos;s share of recoveries is higher. India has so far recorded about 20,160 deaths from Covid-19. In absolute numbers, that is the eighth highest tally in the world. But per million of the population, it is low.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;It&apos;s a fraction of what you are seeing in Western Europe,&quot; said Dr Ravi. There have been a lot of questions around India&apos;s Covid-19 death figures, and most experts agree that they are likely being underreported. But Dr Ravi said that did not explain the significant gap in death rates between India and Europe. &quot;If we were indeed having high death rates, no amount of data could have hidden that - that&apos;s 20-40 times as many deaths,&quot; Dr Ravi said.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>India&apos;s low death rate is also similar to other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia. Theories range from a higher prevalence of infections in the region to a less virulent strain of the virus circulating in other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia to younger populations on average than badly hit Western nations, given that Covid-19 predominantly kills the elderly. &quot;Every country cannot be fudging its data,&quot; Dr Jameel said. &quot;Maybe innate immunity in these populations is higher due to a high load of other infections.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But we really do not know yet why their deaths rates are so low.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>5. Each Indian state tells us a different story Much like the US or the European Union, coronavirus statistics vary widely across India&apos;s states. Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country&apos;s caseload. And as case numbers have waned in some areas, Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country&apos;s caseload have surged in others. The latest surge is in Karnataka and Telangana, in the south. Another southern state, Andhra Pradesh, is also seeing consistent and intense spikes.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>India&apos;s response to the virus has so far been centralised, and that is part of what needs to change, experts said. India would have to be &quot;broken down into districts&quot; to implement a successful strategy against coronavirus, Dr Jameel said, &quot;because another national lockdown could be even less effective than the last one. &quot; And rather than state-level snapshots, the authorities would need granular, localised data, according to Dr Ravi. &quot;Every block, we must know if you have symptoms,&quot; Dr Ravi said.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> Coronavirus: Fact-checking claims  Coronavirus might have started in August 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window  Coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan - but was  Coronavirus circulating earlier than thought? There&apos;s been criticism of a study from the US suggesting that  Coronavirus could have been present in the Chinese city of Wuhan as early as August last year. dismissed by China and had its methodology challenged by independent scientists We&apos;ve looked at the techniques used in the report and found shortcomings both in the use of satellite imagery and online search data, raising significant doubts about its overall findings. The research is based on satellite imagery of traffic movements around hospitals in Wuhan and the tracking of online searches for specific medical symptoms. The research says there was a noticeable rise in vehicles parking outside six hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan from late August to 1 December 2019. This coincided, says the Harvard report, with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as &quot;cough&quot; and &quot;diarrhoea&quot;. the Harvard report, with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as &quot;cough&quot; and &quot;diarrhoea&quot; monitored Wuhan traffic patterns This would be an important finding because the earliest reported case in Wuhan The academics write: &quot;While we cannot confirm if the increased volume was directly related to the new virus, our evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan Seafood market. &quot; The Harvard study has gained a lot of traction in the media, with President Trump, who has been highly critical of China&apos;s pandemic response, tweeting a Fox News item highlighting the researchers&apos; findings . The tweet has been viewed more than three million times. The study, which hasn&apos;t been peer-reviewed - the process by which academic papers get checked by other scientists - claims there was an increase in online queries for coronavirus symptoms, particularly &quot;diarrhoea&quot;, on popular Chinese search engine Baidu. However, Baidu company officials have disputed their findings, saying there was in fact a decrease in searches for &quot;diarrhoea&quot; over this period. The term used in the Harvard University paper actually translates from Chinese as &quot;symptom of diarrhoea&quot;. We checked this on Baidu&apos;s tool that allows users to analyse the popularity of search queries, like Google Trends. The search-term &quot;symptom of diarrhoea&quot; does indeed show an increase in queries from August 2019. However, We also ran the term &quot;diarrhoea&quot;, a more common search-term in Wuhan, and it actually showed a decrease from August 2019 until the outbreak began. A lead author of the Harvard paper, Benjamin Rader, told the BBC that &quot;the search term We chose for &apos;diarrhoea&apos; was chosen because it was the best match for confirmed cases of Covid-19 and was suggested as a related search term to coronavirus&quot;. We also looked at the popularity of searches for &quot;fever&quot; and &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot;, two other common symptoms of coronavirus. Searches for &quot;fever&quot; increased a small amount after August at a similar rate to &quot;cough&quot;, and queries for &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot; decreased in the same period. There have also been questions raised about the study using diarrhoea as an indicator of the disease. of nearly 17,000 coronavirus patients found that diarrhoea was the seventh most common symptom, well below the top three: cough, fever and shortness of breath.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Across the six hospitals, the study using diarrhoea as an indicator oHarvardisease reported a rise in cars in hospital parking lots from August to December 2019. However, we&apos;ve found some serious flaws in The researchers analysis. The researchers studied and annotated satellite images showing Wuhan hospitals The report states that images with tree cover and building shadows were excluded to avoid over or under-counting of vehicles. However, satellite images released to the media show large areas of hospital car parks blocked by tall buildings which means that it&apos;s not possible to accurately assess the number of cars present. To show this, we&apos;ve selected two of these images taken at different times of the Hubei Women and Children Hospital. The first is of the healthcare centre in October 2018 - and we&apos;ve marked with white boxes the parking area obscured by buildings. This second image below - taken in October 2019 - shows the same hospital at a different angle. In this image there&apos;s a full view of the spaces previously hidden by the buildings. Looking at other satellite images used in The report, we found car parks in other hospitals obscured in a similar way. There&apos;s also an underground car park at Tianyou Hospital, which is visible on Baidu&apos;s street view function, but only the entrance is in view on satellite imagery - not the cars underneath the ground. Report author Benjamin Rader said &quot;we definitely can&apos;t account for underground parking in any time period of the study and this is one of the limitations of this type of research. &quot;</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The researchers could have compared their data with other Chinese cities to see if the rises in hospital traffic and search queries were specific to Wuhan, where the outbreak first came to light, or whether similar patterns where observed elsewhere. The study findings - that coronavirus may have been present in Wuhan as far back as last August - are for the reasons we&apos;ve highlighted, highly problematic. There is, however, still much we don&apos;t know about the early onset of the virus in China - both when and how the first cases emerged. What the virus does to the body How do we get out of this mess?</paragraphs>

Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to £100, the government is to announce. The move will bring England into line with Scotland and other major European nations like Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. It has been compulsory on public transport in England since 15 June. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast the new mandatory rule for face coverings in shops does not apply to retail staff. &quot;It is about managing the overall risk,&quot; Environment Secretary George Eustice added. &quot;Any type of covering will be sufficient for this purpose. &quot; It follows a reported increase in the use of face coverings by people in England, Scotland and Wales.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>But Environment Secretary George Eustice said research on the use of face coverings, including advice from the World Health Organization, had been &quot;evolving&quot;. The delay between the announcement and the rule coming into force on 24 July &quot;gives people time to prepare&quot; but people will start wearing coverings from today People are &quot;intelligent and responsible enough&quot; to wear face coverings and the mandatory rule sends &quot;a much stronger signal that people will follow in greater numbers&quot; Wearing face coverings in shops is an &quot;appropriate mitigation&quot; against the &quot;overall risk&quot; of the coronavirus but the rule would not work in pubs, cafes or restaurants Media playback is unsupported on your device Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme: &quot;With all of our laws there is an element of policing by consent and so we need the public to play their part and abide by the restrictions. &quot;</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to £100. This will be reduced to £50 if people pay within 14 days.

Shoppers in Wales and Northern Ireland are not currently required to wear them, although both nations have said this will be kept under review. Police did not issue a single fine across Scotland over the first weekend of compulsory face coverings Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told Today that, on public transport in London, some 18,500 people have been stopped from travelling for not wearing a face covering since 15 June with 59 fines issued.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs>Face coverings steam up your glasses, they&apos;re uncomfortable, they infringe on personal freedom, say BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast listeners - and that&apos;s before the matter of enforcement. Andy, in Manchester, says the discomfort means he&apos;s less likely to go to the shops and now worries shopping must carry a higher risk than Andy thought. Andy doubts the increase in footfall that shops need will follow. Another listener with a long list of questions pleads for more guidance. Can we keep more guidance in our pocket? How often should we replace more guidance? Are disposable ones better? But there&apos;s reassurance from Scotland, where face coverings have been mandatory in shops since Friday. Pamela, who runs a clothes shop in East Kilbride, says most of her customers have been happy to wear one - only one refused because they didn&apos;t like it. her says it&apos;s a habit you need to get into and will be giving uncovered customers gentle reminders. Roz, a nurse in nearby Glasgow, says if her can wear a mask for her 13-hour shifts, it&apos;s not a big issue to wear one for half an hour around the shops - &quot;you have to think of the greater good. &quot;</paragraphs>

While welcoming clarity over the issue, shop workers union Usdaw said coverings could not be a substitute for strict hygiene controls and social distancing measures, such as limiting the number of people allowed in a store at any one time. The British Retail Consortium said it hoped the announcement &quot;will make shoppers feel even more confident about returning to the High Street&quot;. Scarves or other textile items that can be used to continually cover the nose and mouth without having to be held in place by hand are considered adequate in non-medical settings. the High Street said the High Street would keep the new guidance on face coverings in other settings, such as offices, under review.</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs> UK economy rebounds more slowly than expected These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window The UK&apos;s economy rebounded more slowly than expected in May, growing just 1. 8% from the previous month, as the gradual easing of lockdown had a modest impact.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Manufacturing and house building showed signs of recovery in May as some firms saw staff return to work.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>But the Office for National Statistics said The UK&apos;s economy was &quot;in the doldrums&quot;. As a result of big contractions in previous months, The UK&apos;s economy is now 24. 5% smaller than in was in February, the ONS added. What do the experts make of the latest figures? The return to economic growth in May was described as &quot;disappointing&quot; by economists, who had expected an expansion of 5% or more. The increase came after a fall of 6. 9% in March and a record 20. 4% decline in April. &quot;The UK&apos;s economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February, before the full effects of the pandemic struck,&quot; said Mthe ONS.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;In the important services sector, we saw some pick-up in retail, which saw record online sales. However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines. &quot; Are things going to get better now? Mr Athow told the BBC&apos;s Today programme that there could be signs of improvement in next month&apos;s release of figures. &quot;Some of the survey data we&apos;re seeing suggests that as more of The UK&apos;s economy reopened and as some of the restrictions were eased, we did see stronger performance in June, but it&apos;s really early,&quot; Mr Athow said. &quot;You&apos;ve got one month of firm data and some indicators suggesting June might be stronger, but there&apos;s a long road to go here and we&apos;re still trying to figure out what firm data is to understand the overall picture. &quot; Media playback is unsupported on your device &apos;We need a date to restart so we can save our staff&apos; Which parts of The UK&apos;s economy returned to growth? May&apos;s modest month-on-month expansion came as sectors such as manufacturing, construction, DIY retailers and garden centres were allowed to reopen.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in The UK&apos;s economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of The UK&apos;s economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. It&apos;s been used since the 1940s. It&apos;s the main way of determining the health of The UK&apos;s economy.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>What is GDP and why does it matter?</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>&quot;Today&apos;s figures underline the scale of the challenge we face,&quot; said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. &quot;I know people are worried about the security of their jobs and incomes. That&apos;s why I set out our Plan for Jobs last week, following the PM&apos;s new deal for Britain, to protect, support and create jobs as we safely reopen The UK&apos;s economy. &quot;our Plan for Jobs invests up to £30bn in significant and targeted support to put people&apos;s livelihoods at the centre of our national renewal as our emerge through the other side of this crisis. &quot; Can The UK&apos;s economy get back on track? A quarter of The UK&apos;s economy&apos;s output was lost under lockdown in March and April, and May&apos;s figures show even firms who are back in business may be struggling to get on track. It&apos;s one thing being allowed to open the doors again (and some firms remain mothballed); another to be confident you can do so safely. And then there&apos;s the biggest hurdle of all; ensuring customers are willing and able to spend again. As job losses mount, it clear that even some firms who qualify for government help are faltering. Some won&apos;t have made it as far.</paragraphs>
				<label></label>
				<paragraphs>The Bank of England&apos;s own chief economist is among those who&apos;ve voiced hopes for a &quot;V-shaped&quot; recovery; a swift and full bounce back in activity. But history tells us that economies can take years to make up lost ground after a slump. The blow from this crisis was felt within days; convalescence may be tougher. And in the meantime, the livelihoods of many may feel the strain. What are the chances of a speedy recovery? The British Chambers of Commerce said May&apos;s &quot;modest rally&quot; in economic growth did little to alter &quot;the UK&apos;s historically downbeat growth trajectory&quot;. &quot;The pick-up in output in May is more likely to reflect the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen rather than evidence of a genuine recovery,&quot; said the BCC&apos;s head of economics, Suren Thiru. &quot;While UK economic output may grow further in the short term as restrictions ease, this may dissipate as the economic scarring caused by the pandemic starts to bite, particularly as government support winds down. &quot; Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data showed the recovery was &quot;maybe not so V-shaped after all&quot; - a reference to remarks last month by Bank of England economist Andy Haldane , who said UK was on track for a quick recovery. He said May&apos;s figure was &quot;a disappointing first step on the road to recovery&quot; and suggested that &quot;hopes of a rapid rebound from the lockdown are wide of the mark&quot;. &quot;Indeed, the path to full economic recovery will probably be much longer than most people anticipate,&quot; He added.

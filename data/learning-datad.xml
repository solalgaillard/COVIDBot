			<data> Who Is at Increased Risk for Severe Illness? What are you looking for? Help control the spread of rumors and be aware of fraud schemes. What is a novel coronavirus? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. and cause mild illness, like the common cold. Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19? an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. How does the virus spread? The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food? Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19? It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. What is community spread? Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website. Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19? At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. for more information. How can I protect myself? page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19. Does CDC recommend the use of facemask or face coverings to prevent COVID-19? Wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. While people who are sick or know that they have COVID-19 should isolate at home, COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear cloth face coverings in public settings. Cloth face coverings provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. More information about cloth face coverings can be found on our cloth face coverings site.

Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date. about your medical conditions, or if you get sick. management or other conditions. health condition that requires immediate attention. If you need emergency help, call 911. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care for your medical condition. Wash your hands often, avoid close contact, wear a cloth face covering, cover coughs and sneezes, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces often. Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products? There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Is it okay for me to donate blood? In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time. Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19? Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers. to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses. People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional. for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care. Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19? for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus. to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present. Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected. for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care. Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19? Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19? Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick? Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. , as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person. However, some people may need emergency medical attention. *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19? Be alert for symptoms. Take your temperature and follow CDC guidance if you have symptoms. What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19? Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C. How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection? You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, like tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles). is available online. Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults? The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems. CDC and partners are investigating cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Should children wear face coverings? CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance. How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community? Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. When you talk with your child, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and who is at risk? is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. , or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care. or other concerning signs. Can my child hang out with their friends? The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. , such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk. How can I help my child continue learning? Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Look for ways to make learning fun. Will kids have access to school meals? Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location. How can I keep my children healthy? Watch your child for any signs of illness. Watch for signs of stress in your child. Help your child stay active. Help your child stay socially connected. Limit time with older adults, including relatives, and people with chronic medical conditions. are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19. , consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people. If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals and someone at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people. Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail. Is my child with an underlying medical condition at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19? It’s not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed. What additional steps should families that have a child with an underlying medical condition take? Identify potential alternative caregivers, if you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. Try to have at least one month of medication and medical supplies on hand. Some health plans allow for a 90-day supply of prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your child’s healthcare provider. Review any care plans for your child, such as an asthma action plan, and make sure caregivers and backup caregivers are familiar with these plans. , try to make them. They typically include important information about your child’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to get in touch with your child’s doctors, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other) or special needs, daily routines and activities, friends, and details about routines that are important to support behavioral and emotional health. Learn if your child’s healthcare providers, including doctors and therapists, have new ways to be contacted or new ways of providing appointments. If they offer telemedicine visits, find out how those are arranged and any additional information you need. If your child receives any support care services in the home that need to be continued, make plans for what you will do if those direct care providers get sick, or if persons in your household are sick. Discuss with the support care agencies and the providers ways to minimize risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. have been met. , or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. if they will be close (less than 6 feet) to you or persons in your household. Their cloth face covering helps protect you if they are infected but do not have symptoms. Ask them to wash their hands with soap and water or, if unavailable, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when they enter your home, before and after helping your child (dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting and/or diapering, feeding), after handling tissues, and after changing linens or doing laundry. Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards, and other assistive devices. What can I do if my child has difficulties adjusting to new routines and following recommendations? , can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs. Keeping children at home can lower stress created by social distancing and cloth face covering recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands. Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations. Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your child’s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19. Your child’s therapist(s) and teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child. While learning at home, continue special education services, accommodations, or services received in school through your child’s 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), as much as possible. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more. How can my family cope with the added stress? Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past. What if my child or someone else in the home is sick with symptoms of COVID-19? , contact your child’s healthcare provider. , such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911. If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that first responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others. Notify your child’s healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specific for your child. or suspected of having COVID-19. What if my child’s symptoms of their underlying medical condition or complex, chronic medical condition get worse? Call your child’s healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your child’s medical conditions. If you need emergency help, call 911. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you and your child from getting COVID-19 if your child needs care for medical conditions not related to COVID-19. Do not delay getting emergency care for your child’s underlying condition or complex medical condition because you are afraid of getting exposed to COVID-19 when visiting the healthcare setting. What if my child needs to go to the hospital? Ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share important information about caring for your child. Visiting policies may have changed due to COVID-19. If your child’s hospital policy does not allow an adult to stay with a child, ask your child’s healthcare provider for a statement explaining your child’s need for a familiar adult to be present. Bring your care plans/emergency notebook with you along with paper and pen to write down questions you have during your time at the hospital. How can I prepare for an outbreak in my area? Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community. Make sure they have access to 2 weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time. Get to know your neighbors and find out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected. Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources. Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources. How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work? Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19. Should I make my own hand sanitizer if I can’t find it in the stores? and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. World Health Organization guidance. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available. need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy. Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices. Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause? People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. When should I seek emergency care if I have COVID-19? *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. Is it possible to have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time? It is possible to test positive for flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time. Should I be tested for COVID-19? Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. for more information. How can I get tested for COVID-19? : viral tests and antibody tests. A viral test checks for a current infection. An antibody test checks for a previous infection. health department and tell them about your symptoms and how you think you may have been exposed to the virus. Your healthcare provider can let you know if they offer viral tests at their office. Your state or local health department can provide local information on where testing is available. for more information. If you want an antibody test, call your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. You can also visit your state or local health department’s website for local information on antibody testing. Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19? Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. for more information. What kind of tests are being used to diagnose COVID-19? Viral tests are used to diagnose COVID-19. These tests tell you if you currently have an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. There are many viral tests available. All of the viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples, such as from swabs from the inside of your nose. Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the laboratory receives your samples. Two tests allow you to collect your sample at home – either a swab from the inside of your nose or a saliva sample – but you will still need to send the sample to a laboratory for processing. Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. What is antibody testing? And can I be tested using this method? Antibody testing checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19. When someone gets COVID-19, their body usually makes antibodies. However, it typically takes one to three weeks to develop these antibodies. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies. A positive result from this test may mean that person was previously infected with the virus. Talk to your healthcare provider about what your antibody test result means. be used to diagnose COVID-19. To see if you are currently infected, you need a viral test. Viral tests identify the virus in respiratory samples, such as swabs from the inside of your nose. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last. Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions. If I have recovered from COVID-19, will I be immune to it? We do not know yet if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. CDC and partners are investigating to determine if a person can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19? COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do? If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19. How were the underlying conditions for people considered higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 selected? What we are learning from the outbreak in other countries and in the United States. What we know about risk from other respiratory infections, like flu. As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed. Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19? Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19. People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider. What about underlying medical conditions that are not included on this list? Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned. to protect yourself and others. with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials. What does a well-controlled health condition mean? Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed. What does more severe illness mean? Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body’s function. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed. Are people with disabilities at higher risk? Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19. Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition. People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed. What is contact tracing? Contact tracing is used by health departments to prevent the spread of infectious disease. In general, contact tracing involves identifying people who have an infectious disease (cases) and their contacts (people who may have been exposed) and working with them to interrupt disease transmission. at home voluntarily. Connecting contacts with services they might need during the self-quarantine period. To prevent the further spread of disease, COVID-19 contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to a person with COVID-19. What happens during contact tracing? Public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time when they may have been infectious. Public health staff begin contact tracing by notifying exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, not revealing the infected patient’s identity. Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to help them understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, and how to monitor themselves for illness. In addition, they are informed of the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they do not feel ill. Contacts are encouraged to stay home, monitor their health, and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others until 14 days after their last exposure to the infected patient, in case they also become ill. Who is considered a close contact to someone with COVID-19? For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient was isolated. What can a person diagnosed with COVID-19 expect to happen during contact tracing? If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, a case investigator from the health department may call you to check-in on your health, discuss who you’ve been in contact with, and ask where you spent time while you may have been infectious and able to spread COVID-19 to others. , if you are not doing so already. be revealed to those you may have exposed, even if they ask. , and using a separate bathroom, if possible. Self-isolation helps slow the spread of COVID-19 and can help keep your family, friends, neighbors, and others you may come in contact with healthy. If you need support or assistance while self-isolating, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care. include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. What can close contacts expect to happen during contact tracing? If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, a contact tracer from the health department might contact you to inform you that you’ve been exposed to COVID-19. for 14 days, starting from the last day you were possibly exposed to COVID-19. The contact tracer will help identify the dates of your self-quarantine. The contact tracer can also provide resources about COVID-19 testing in your area. Self-quarantine means staying home, monitoring your health, and maintaining social distancing (at least 6 feet) from others at all times. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a cloth face covering. This will help protect the people around you. If you need support or assistance with self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. , and notify your health department if you develop symptoms. You should also notify people you had close contact with recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical care. include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a cloth face covering? Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a cloth face covering while you were around someone with COVID-19. Cloth face coverings are meant to prevent someone from transmitting the disease to others, and not to protect someone from becoming infected. What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing? Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. Your name will not be revealed to those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify your close contacts that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. How data are collected, stored, and shared are specific to each state or jurisdiction. What if I have been around someone who was identified as a close contact? You do not need to self-quarantine. Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19? There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19. Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away? we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i. e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator). Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e. g., concentration, application method and contact time). are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled. What do funeral home workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19? A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. , including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e. g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc. ). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag. Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e. g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e. g., concentration, application method and contact time). by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled. Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases. How can loved ones safely handle belongings of someone who died from COVID-19? Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility. Family members should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling these items. What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas? When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance. My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the United States? CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office. At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71. The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment. for additional information. What is CDC doing about COVID-19? CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect people’s health. is available online. What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting? with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been present? The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical. Consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is less that needs to be vacuumed. Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility. What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19? Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface. Is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes COVID-19? Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Who should clean and disinfect community spaces? Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used. How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work? Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i. e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. , it can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed. How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light? The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19? Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e. g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19? CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19? CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces. Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19? At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended. Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19? We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering. What animals can get COVID-19? We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19. Should I worry about my pet cat? We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets. Can I walk my dog during the COVID-19 pandemic? Walking your dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not gather in groups, stay out of crowded places, and avoid mass gatherings. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk. Can I take my dog to a dog park? ” for information on dog parks. Can I take my dog to a dog park? Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather. Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park. or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting, or diarrhea. for the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian about when it is appropriate for your pet to go back to normal activities. Try to limit your dog’s interaction with other people outside of your household while at the dog park. As much as possible, avoid touching common items in the dog park like water bowls. or use hand sanitizer after touching items from the park. To make sure your dog has fresh water, consider bringing your own portable water bowl. Limit other pet items brought to the dog park, such as toys. anything taken to the park and returned home (leashes, toys, water bowls). Do not wipe or bathe your dog with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe. Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer? Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather. Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible. Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. Do not put face coverings on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. and recommendations for how to help keep your pet safe. What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19? There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested? Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time, and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed. Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19. Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19. Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept indoors to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people outside of the facility. or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in the facility. to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19. from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible. What about imported animals or animal products? CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources. Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak? apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies. What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)? requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus. If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young. Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat. Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead. Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread it back to people? Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19. Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic? Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game. Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead. Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal. Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal. Wear rubber or disposable gloves. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them. Check with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat. How can I safely run my equestrian facility? You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility. Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Consider conducting daily health checks (e. g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.
should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. for more information. Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home. Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas. to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a cloth face covering does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing. at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry. such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants. on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding. from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders. Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities. People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a cloth face covering to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water. have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. What is community mitigation? Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, and prepare for it if it occurs, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available. Community Mitigation Framework. What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19? Community Mitigation Framework. Who is involved in community mitigation actions? Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. , and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. Local decisions depend on local circumstances. Community Mitigation Framework. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water? The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink. Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool)? The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through pools, hot tubs, spas, and water playgrounds? There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. when not in the water. for additional information. Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems? The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether this virus can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19? Recently, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. ) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities. for additional information.

If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e. g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e. g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings. Who Is at Increased Risk for Severe Illness?</data>

			<data> Note:  This document is intended to provide guidance on the appropriate use of testing and does not dictate the determination of payment decisions or insurance coverage of such testing, except as may be otherwise referenced (or prescribed) by another entity or federal or state agency. Changes noted were made in a retired document, “Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” which has been replaced by this Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. This document provides a summary of considerations and current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing. The CDC recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been developed based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Authorized assays for viral testing include those that detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen. check samples from the respiratory system (such as nasal swabs) and identify if an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is present. Viral tests are recommended to diagnose acute infection. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that may take 1-2 days once received by the lab. Testing the same individual more than once in a 24-hour period is not recommended. for handling and processing specimens from possible cases. as the sole basis for diagnosis of acute infection, and antibody tests are not authorized by FDA for such diagnostic purposes. of persons who present late in their illnesses when used in conjunction with viral detection tests. In addition, if a person is suspected to have post-infectious syndrome (e. ) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, serologic assays may be used. for SARS-CoV-2, now broadly available, can play an important role in understanding the transmission dynamic of the virus in the general population and identifying groups at higher risk for infection. Unlike viral direct detection methods, such as nucleic acid amplification or antigen detection tests that can detect acutely infected persons, antibody tests help determine whether the individual being tested was previously infected—even if that person never showed symptoms. It is currently not clear whether a positive serologic test indicates immunity against SARS-CoV-2; serologic tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune. As additional data are collected to understand the significance of the presence or level of antibodies and their correlation with immunity, serologic tests may have utility in infection control decisions, but for now this evidence is not available. These tests can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, demographic and geographic patterns of serologic test results can help determine which communities may have experienced a higher infection rate. Generally, viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be diagnostic when conducted among individuals with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or among asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission, or to determine resolution of infection. Testing is considered to be surveillance when conducted among asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification, or to detect transmission hot spots or characterize disease trends. symptoms when there is a concern of potential COVID-19. Tests should be used in accordance with the authorized labeling; providers should be familiar with the tests’ performance characteristics and limitations. compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e. . Clinicians are encouraged to consider testing for other causes of respiratory illness, for example influenza, in addition to testing for SARS-CoV-2 depending on patient age, season, or clinical setting; detection of one respiratory pathogen (e. g., influenza) does not exclude the potential for co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. The severity of symptomatic illness due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 may vary. g., healthcare personnel [HCP]), even mild signs and symptoms (e. g., sore throat) of possible COVID-19 should prompt consideration for testing. of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially initial testing during an outbreak or pandemic due to the high likelihood of exposure. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, it is important that contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested. for more information. born to women with COVID-19, regardless of whether there are signs of infection in the neonate. In some settings, broader testing, beyond close contacts, is recommended as a part of a strategy to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This includes high-risk settings that have potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 (e. g., meat processing plant) or in which populations at risk for severe disease (e. g., long-term care facilities, including nursing homes, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric residential treatment facilities) could become exposed. Expanded testing might include testing of all contacts in proximity to someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or even testing all individuals within a shared setting (e. Certain settings can experience rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in substantial adverse effects. This is particularly true for settings that house vulnerable populations in close quarters for extended periods of time (e. g., long-term care facilities, correctional and detention facilities) and/or settings where critical infrastructure workers (e. g., healthcare personnel, first responders) may be disproportionately affected. A strategy aimed at reducing introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the setting through early identification could reduce the risk of widespread transmission in these situations. s to help inform decision-making about broad-based testing. Before testing large numbers of asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure, the facility should have a plan in place for how it will modify operations based on test results. Testing of new entrants into the setting and/or those re-entering after a prolonged absence (e. Pre-admission or pre-procedure testing as part of the evaluation of patients could be considered to inform decisions about deferring elective care (e. procedures) or procedures and the use of personal protective equipment. A test-based strategy, which requires serial tests, can be used as an alternative to a symptom-based or time-based strategy, to determine when a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection no longer requires isolation or work exclusion. , which uses multiple surveillance systems and epidemiology networks, in collaboration with state, local, and academic partners, to monitor the progression and impact of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States. Viral tests are used in community, outpatient, and hospital-based surveillance systems to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data help identify areas of ongoing circulation (hot spots), determine trends in disease by location, provide insight into the impact of the disease over time and by location, and inform disease forecasts. are increasingly used to monitor disease burden by location and over time. can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, demographic and geographic patterns of serologic test results provide data that can be used in forecasts of disease spread that can support resource allocation decisions and planning by local, territorial and state officials.

			<data> Find pages with. What are you looking for? How do clinicians get access to SARS-CoV-2 viral testing? Clinicians can access laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized or intended to be authorized by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their diagnostic services to see how best to access SARS-CoV-2 testing. provides a list of available public health laboratory testing locations. Under what circumstances should laboratories use either a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from FDA? FDA has authorized EUAs for both viral and antibody tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed. Where do laboratories get access to reagents and materials to perform viral testing for SARS-CoV-2? The IRR supports state and local public health laboratories, as well as other qualified laboratories participating in public health surveillance and studies, by providing reagents, tools, and information for studying SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. Through IRR, CDC also provides the reagents that public health laboratories use to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory specimens. One test for SARS-CoV-2 detection is a CDC-developed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that received an EUA from FDA on February 4, 2020, to detect the virus in upper and lower respiratory specimens. IRR also provides several additional commercially produced assays that have received an EUA from FDA to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in respiratory samples. conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing can acquire test reagents from commercial reagent manufacturers that have received EUA from FDA. Genomic RNA material for validation purposes can be obtained from BEI Resources as indicated below. Can laboratories use specimen collection devices other than those listed in the manufacturer’s instructions or EUA (e. According to FDA, when one entity establishes equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components (including viral transport media [VTM]), and FDA’s review of the validation data indicates that it could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, FDA will post this information on its website so that other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing. Then, other laboratories do not need to conduct their own bridging study for the same modification. Where can I find additional CDC guidance about laboratory testing? I can’t find viral transport media (VTM) for SARS-CoV-2 testing. What are my options? can order VTM through IRR, as noted above. should acquire VTM from commercial sources. Public health and clinical laboratories can also create their own VTM if they are unable to order it. to create VTM for laboratories. Saline is also an acceptable transport media for some COVID-19 viral assays, including the CDC EUA. to see which transport media is acceptable. My facility would like to begin SARS-CoV-2 testing. Do we need a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate? Can my facility be granted a waiver from the CLIA certification requirements so that I can begin testing immediately? Before conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, a laboratory must be CLIA-certified and meet applicable regulatory requirements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have the authority to grant waivers of exceptions that are not established in a statute or regulation. What is the CLIA test complexity categorization of SARS-CoV-2 tests that do not have an EUA? Thus, those tests are considered high complexity by default until they receive an EUA or other FDA review that indicates they may be performed as moderate complexity or waived tests. , and navigate to the section titled “General FAQs. When FDA authorizes emergency use for a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test, can that test be used in CLIA certificate-of-waiver facilities? When the FDA grants an EUA for a point-of-care test, that test is deemed to be CLIA-waived. For the duration of the national emergency declaration for COVID-19, such tests can be performed in any CLIA-certified patient care setting with a certificate of waiver. How do I apply for a CLIA certificate so that my testing facility can perform SARS-CoV-2 testing? The federal CLIA program contracts with states to carry out certain oversight and recording functions of the CLIA program. The state in which the laboratory is located processes applications for CLIA certificates. and has provided all required information on the CMS-116 application, a CLIA number will be assigned and the laboratory can begin testing if applicable CLIA requirements have been met. Are pathologists able to sign out cases remotely during the COVID-19 public health emergency? CMS has indicated that it will allow laboratories to use temporary testing sites for remote review and reporting of laboratory data, slides, and images if specific criteria are met. for additional information. I cannot obtain the materials I need to perform CDC’s test. What should I do? Use a new authorized extraction method performed with the Roche MagNA Pure 24. Use additional extraction reagent options with the already-authorized extraction instruments from Roche and QIAGEN. Use heat treatment to replace the extraction method. However, heat treatment is recommended only if insufficient extraction reagents are available to extract every clinical specimen received. This is because of the potential reduction in test sensitivity. Please note: Laboratories using heat treatment will still need extraction reagents on hand to aid in resolution of any inconclusive or invalid test results obtained for heat-treated specimens and to test lower respiratory specimens. Where do test developers get the genomic RNA needed to validate test performance for FDA? Currently, genomic RNA material can be used for validation purposes in biosafety level 2 laboratories (BSL-2). with BEI Resources is required to request SARS-CoV-2 materials. BEI Resources is prioritizing and fast-tracking all SARS-CoV-2 registrations with a 12- to 72-hour turnaround time for all SARS-CoV-2-related registrations. or 1-800 359-7370 for questions. Developers are required to sign a material transfer agreement prior to the release of materials. All BEI Resources reagents are provided worldwide. There is no cost for the reagents themselves. However, shipping and handling charges may apply. Commercial sources also may have this material. What is NIH's BEI Resources Repository? agents, non-pathogenic microbes, and other microbiological materials of relevance to the research community including diagnostic developers. Centralizing these functions within BEI Resources facilitates access to these materials by the scientific community and ensures quality control of the reagents. My facility created a laboratory-developed test (LDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2. We need to have the first five positive and negative specimens confirmed. Can we send these specimens to CDC? Laboratories using an LDT to detect SARS-CoV-2 should confer with their state public health laboratory for assistance. Does CDC accept specimens for antibody testing? CDC is currently performing antibody surveys to understand how COVID-19 has spread in the U. CDC is not using its antibody tests for diagnostic purposes, and thus is not accepting antibody test requests intended for COVID-19 patient diagnosis. Will CDC submit its antibody test for an EUA? Not at this time. CDC is using its antibody test as part of a multi-agency study to evaluate current commercially marketed antibody tests for specificity and sensitivity and to help determine how results from antibody tests could support policymaking. CDC will share information publicly on the recommended use of antibody testing as soon as enough data becomes available. Should I test for IgG, IgM, or total immunoglobulin? Currently, there is no identified performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine which assay you choose to use. Using an assay that tests for IgM antibodies might be able to detect a more recent infection with SARS-CoV-2, but we do not yet have enough data to confirm this. We need additional data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 before we can make evidence-based recommendations about these different assays. Scientists from CDC and elsewhere are investigating how SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses develop over time. How should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks? All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on the procedures performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. The risk assessment should identify all potential scenarios of a particular activity that could produce a negative outcome. The risk assessment should prioritize those potential negative outcomes, or risks, based on an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of each of those identified risks. The risk assessment should determine the most appropriate control measures, and how the system will measure the effectiveness of those control measures. Are certified Class II biological safety cabinets (BSCs) required to process suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 specimens? Should laboratory staff put procedures in place to minimize personnel exposure if there is no certified Class II BSC? For procedures with a high likelihood to generate aerosols or droplets, use either a certified Class II Type A1 or A2 BSC or additional precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel. Examples of these additional precautions include personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, like a splash shield; centrifuge safety cups; and sealed centrifuge rotors to reduce the risk of exposure to laboratory personnel. How should point-of-care testing (POCT) be conducted outside a traditional laboratory? For viral testing of specimens conducted outside of a traditional clinical laboratory, such as rapid respiratory testing, use Standard Precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel during specimen manipulation. If laboratory personnel collect blood or respiratory specimens directly from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, what PPE should they wear? If laboratory personnel have direct contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, they should follow recommended PPE for health care providers while in the presence of these patients. OSHA 29 CFR 1910. What is the recommended biosafety level for handling suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens? • Final packaging of specimens for transport to diagnostic laboratories for additional testing. OSHA 29 CFR 1910. What disinfectant should personnel use to decontaminate work surfaces? Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment with appropriate disinfectants. Follow manufacturer’s recommendations for use, such as dilution, contact time, and safe handling. How should specimens be stored? C for up to 72 hours after collection. C or lower. C or lower. How should laboratory personnel remove biohazardous waste from the laboratory or testing area for decontamination and disposal? Handle laboratory waste from testing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient specimens as all other biohazardous waste in the laboratory. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that this laboratory waste needs additional packaging or disinfection procedures. How should personnel transport suspected or confirmed SARS CoV-2 specimens within a facility? Personnel should adhere to standard procedures associated with other respiratory pathogens, such as seasonal influenza and other human coronaviruses, when they transport specimens within a facility. Personnel should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs. Laboratory biosafety guidance related to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). What are Standard Precautions? Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat) may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. What are infectious aerosols and droplets? containing particles that are	&lt;100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles can be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment. are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents. They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (&lt;5 μm in diameter). Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of Aspergillus spp. traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (&gt;5 μm in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure. Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and Neisseria meningitidis. What procedures can generate aerosols and droplets? Many routine laboratory procedures can potentially generate aerosols and droplets that are often undetectable. The following laboratory procedures have been associated with the generation of infectious aerosols and droplets: centrifugation, pipetting, vortexing, mixing, shaking, sonicating, removing caps, decanting liquids, preparing smears, flaming slides, aliquoting and loading specimens, loading syringes, manipulating needles, syringes or sharps, aspirating and transferring blood and body fluids, subculturing blood culture bottles, spilling specimens, and cleaning up spills. Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th Ed. Can the pneumatic tube system be used to transport patient specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients? CDC recommends that respiratory specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should not be transported through pneumatic tubes. At this time, this recommendation only applies to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 respiratory specimens. Examples of respiratory specimens include nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swabs, tracheal and lower respiratory tract aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens, and sputum. Based on currently available data, other types of specimens, such as blood, urine, and feces, are still acceptable to transport through pneumatic tubes. Facilities should ensure that all personnel who transport specimens via pneumatic tubes are trained in safe handling practices, specimen management, and spill decontamination procedures. Each facility should also evaluate its risks and determine the most appropriate biosafety measures and practices to implement. How should decentralized and point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19 diagnostic purposes be conducted outside of a traditional laboratory? Testing sites that operate a POC diagnostic instrument must have a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certificate. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will permit a laboratory to extend its existing Certificate of Waiver to operate a temporary COVID-19 testing site in an off-site location (e. g., long-term care or correctional facilities). The temporary COVID-19 testing site is only permitted to perform waived tests, consistent with the laboratory’s existing CLIA certificate, and must be under the direction of the existing laboratory director. Use the instrument in a location that has a current CLIA certificate. Perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate safety risks. Train staff on the proper use of the instrument and ways to minimize their risk of exposure. , including hand hygiene and the use of PPE, such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. If needed, additional precautions can be used, such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, such as a splash shield to work behind. When using patient swabs, minimize contamination of the swab stick and wrapper by widely opening the wrapper before placing the swab back into the wrapper. Change gloves after adding patient specimens to the instrument. Decontaminate the instrument after each run by using an EPA-approved disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 and following the manufacturer’s recommendations for use, including dilution, contact time, and safe handling. What safety issues are there with PrimeStore® Molecular Transport Medium (MTM) when used with SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms? MTM transport media contains guanidine thiocyanate, which produces a dangerous chemical reaction that releases cyanide gas when exposed to bleach (sodium hypochlorite). MTM transport media being provided by state health departments is currently labeled at the bulk box level, but individual vials lack labels to warn users of the reactive ingredient. MTM with any Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) platforms that include a disinfecting step that uses bleach (e.
MTM may be harmful by inhalation, in contact with skin, and if swallowed. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) as required by your laboratory protocols, including laboratory coat, safety glasses, and gloves. Dispose of product content and container in accordance with all local, regional, national, and international regulations. Untreated waste should not be disposed into the sewer unless fully compliant with all applicable requirements. for disposal information. What safety issues can occur when using a mixture of A549 and Mv 1 Lu cell lines (also referred to as A549/Mv 1 Lu mix or R-Mix™) for culturing respiratory viruses? It has been shown that Mv 1 Lu cells can support low level replication of SARS-CoV, which could result in the inadvertent growth of SARS-CoV-2. ) or any other mixture containing Mv 1 Lu cell lines. ) do not support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Do people packing patient specimens, isolates or cultures for transport need to be trained and competent? For transporting patient specimens, cultures or isolates, personnel must be trained in the proper safety, packing, and shipping regulations for Division 6. . Personnel should be trained in a manner that corresponds to their function-specific responsibilities. What specific packaging should personnel use when shipping suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens, isolates or cultures? A leakproof primary container. A leakproof, watertight secondary packaging with absorbent material. A rigid outer packaging to protect the specimens during shipment. At what temperature should specimens be shipped? C with ice packs. If the specimen is frozen, ship overnight on dry ice. The primary receptacle and the secondary packaging should maintain their integrity at the temperature of the refrigerant used as well as the temperatures and the pressures which could result if refrigeration were lost. Packages containing dry ice should be designed and constructed so as to prevent the buildup of pressure and to allow the release of gas that could rupture the packaging. What information is required on the outer package for shipment of specimens with ice packs? Click on “Infectious substances” and there is an option to download the packing instructions. – Include the name and telephone number of the person who will be available during normal business hours who knows the content of the shipment (can be someone at CDC). Place the label on one side of the box and cover the label completely with clear tape (do not tape just the edges of the label).

What information is required on an overpack if used for specimen shipment? Is a shipper’s declaration required? What documentation is required for shipment? What if specimens are shipped on dry ice? A shipper’s declaration is not required for UN 3373 Biological Substances, Category B shipped samples. If an Air Waybill is used, the “Nature and Quantity of Goods” box should show “UN 3373 Biological Substance, Category B” along with the number of packages. If specimens are shipped on dry ice, include UN 1845, Dry Ice, 9, along with the net weight of the dry ice. See IATA PI 650 for additional information. Is a Responsible Person required on the shipping paperwork? Yes, a Responsible Person should be listed on the air waybill or Shipper’s Declaration (if applicable). Once packaging of the samples is complete should staff members decontaminate the work area? Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment with appropriate disinfectants. Follow manufacturer’s recommendations for use, such as dilution, contact time, and safe handling. Are stool specimens appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing? Stool specimens do not have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval and thus are not acceptable for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing. Although data are limited, they indicate that stool might not be an appropriate specimen. Stool specimens are less sensitive than respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA is often detected later during COVID-19 illness. Therefore, testing stool early in illness could potentially lead to false negative SARS-CoV-2 viral test results. Also, even though viral tests have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool (i. e., a positive test), infectious virus has only been confirmed very rarely, if at all in samples. In other words, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test does not necessarily mean a patient is currently infected and can infect others. What are the anatomic pathology best practices to prevent COVID-19 exposure while performing procedures and processing specimens? Manual processing of fresh unfixed specimens, including frozen sections, should be conducted in a manner that provides a barrier between the specimen and personnel during specimen manipulation. What precautions should clinical and non-clinical support staff take when handling specimen containers that may be contaminated with blood and body fluids? when handling specimen containers and paper requisitions that could have been contaminated by tissue and fluid specimens. Use face shields and/or work behind a splash guard whenever possible. Store human specimens in closed containers that can be decontaminated before moving them to a secure area. Place specimen containers in closed and clearly labeled plastic bins until pick-up and disposal according to your institutional waste management policies. What are the biosafety recommendations for performing frozen sectioning on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patient specimens? Avoid frozen sectioning from confirmed COVID-19 patients whenever possible. Talk with the relevant clinical and surgical teams about the clinical necessity and benefit of frozen sectioning and consider appropriate alternatives for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consider using a cryostat that has a downdraft and other safety features. Use cryostats in a closed room that has inward directional (negative) airflow vented directly to the outside or recirculated through a HEPA filter to avoid contaminating the rest of the surgical pathology suite. Provide grossing rooms with inward directional air flow. Reduce the number of operators to a minimum. N95 respirator or fluid-resistant surgical mask. Do not use freezing sprays; they are not recommended by the manufacturers of cryostat instrumentation. Wear cut-resistant, stainless steel mesh gloves during disassembly, cleaning, and disinfection of microtome knives. Collect accumulated instrument shavings and discard them as biohazardous waste. Follow local standard decontamination procedures of the cryostat and other surfaces. Ultraviolet lights are not a substitute for terminal cleaning of the instrument. What chemical treatments inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in tissues during histopathology processing? Studies with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have shown that virus inactivation for these coronaviruses occurs in a time-dependent fashion with both formalin fixation and temperatures of 56°C or above. Alcohol at 70% concentration or higher has been shown to inactivate the virus and tissue processing typically includes a series of alcohol dehydration steps that use 70% to 100% alcohol prior to paraffin embedding. In addition, the final step of applying a glass or plastic coverslip to the slide provides an additional barrier between the personnel and the tissue. Does a grossing station that draws air and fumes toward the rear of the unit offer the same protection as a biosafety cabinet? Grossing stations pull formalin fumes away from the person who is doing the dissecting. In general, grossing stations are not as effective as biosafety cabinets at protecting the user from exposure to biological agents. Edition Section III_ Biological Safety Cabinets (page 292). What Is CDC's International Reagent Resource (IRR)? (IRR) was established by CDC more than 10 years ago. It provides registered users with reagents, tools, and information for studying and detecting influenza virus and other pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. IRR is primarily a resource used for procuring pathogen test components and assembling, qualifying, and distributing these kits for use in CDC-directed public health activities. This resource supports detection and characterization of pathogens, which will aid in informing interventions. By centralizing these functions within IRR, access to and use of these materials in the scientific and public health community is monitored and quality control of the reagents is assured. To support health departments during the COVID-19 pandemic, IRR has expanded to provide more products needed for viral testing, including numerous commercially produced Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assays. IRR is managed under a CDC contract by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). What supplies are being distributed by IRR for COVID-19 testing? (See below to learn more about the process for ordering swabs. Where can I find a complete product list of items for SARS-CoV-2 testing? New reagents may be added to the IRR catalog as the emergency response progresses. What is the new process for swab ordering? Starting April 30, 2020, FEMA is assuming responsibility for the production and distribution of LR-1, Flock Swabs. States can reach out to their federal testing contact. The federal government will work with states who are on pace to exceed their testing goals for the month to meet increased testing demand. Can I register my lab or hospital with IRR? CDC limits IRR registration and SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic reagent distribution to U. S. state and local public health laboratories validated to perform SARS-CoV-2 viral testing. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, CDC will defer the decision to authorize new laboratories to the corresponding state public health laboratory. How do I obtain reagents for the CDC EUA real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2? Clinical laboratories can purchase reagents for the CDC EUA real-time RT-PCR primers and probes from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) or Biosearch Technologies. Clinical laboratories also can purchase commercially developed viral tests with an EUA from the manufacturer.</data>

Nationally, levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and COVID-19-like illness (CLI) remain lower than peaks seen in March and April but are increasing in several regions. The percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, also increased from last week. Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week but remains elevated above baseline and may increase as additional death certificates are processed. The overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased from week 24 (6. 5%) to week 25 (7. 6%) nationally, driven by increases in seven regions. Public health laboratories – increased from 5. 2% during week 24 to 6. Clinical laboratories – increased from 4. 7% during week 24 to 5. Commercial laboratories – increased from 6. 9% during week 24 to 7. 9% during week 25. Two surveillance indicators are being used to track outpatient or emergency department (ED) visits for illness with symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Nationally, levels of ILI remain below baseline for the tenth week and in all 10 surveillance regions for the past eight to eleven weeks. However, several regions reported increases in percentage of visits for ILI and CLI. Recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing, are likely affecting data reported from both networks, making it difficult to draw conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give additional insight into illness related to COVID-19. Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates since March 1, 2020, are updated weekly. The overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 98. 4 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (297. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9. 5% during week 24 to 6. 9% during week 25 but remained above baseline. This is the ninth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC, but this may change as more death certificates are processed, particularly for recent weeks. All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Overall, indicators used to monitor COVID-19 activity remain lower than peaks seen in March and April; however, increases are being seen in the percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and percentage of visits for ILI or CLI in multiple parts of the country, in some case for consecutive weeks. Nationally, using combined data from the three laboratory types, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay increased from week 24 (6. 5%) to week 25 (7. Increases were reported in seven of ten HHS surveillance regions, three of which (Region 4 [South East], Region 6 [South Central], and Region 9 [South West/Coast]) reported >10% of specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2. Three regions (Region 1 [New England], Region 3 [Mid-Atlantic] and Region 5 [Midwest]), reported a decrease in percentage of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The percentage of outpatient and emergency department visits for ILI are below baseline nationally and in all regions of the country. Most regions have remained stable, compared to last week; however, a few regions experienced an increase in the percentage of visits for CLI and/or ILI with the largest increases in Regions 4 (South East), 6 (South Central), and 9 (South West/Coast). Systems monitoring ILI and CLI may be influenced by recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 98. 4 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people 65 years of age and older (297. 6 per 100,000) followed by people 50-64 years (148. Hospitalization rates are cumulative and will increase as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5 times that of non-Hispanic White persons, while non-Hispanic Black persons and Hispanic or Latino persons each have a rate approximately 4. 5 times that of non-Hispanic White persons. Cumulative hospitalization rates for COVID-19 in adults (18-64 years) at this time are higher than cumulative end-of-season hospitalization rates for influenza over each of the past 5 influenza seasons. For people 65 years and older, current cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are within ranges of cumulative influenza hospitalization rates observed at comparable time points* during recent influenza seasons. For children (0-17 years), cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are much lower than cumulative influenza hospitalization rates at comparable time points* during recent influenza seasons. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9. 5% during week 24 to 6. 9% during week 25. This is the ninth week during which a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC has been recorded; however, the percentage remains above the epidemic threshold. The percentage may change as additional death certificates for deaths during recent weeks are processed. *Number of weeks since 10% of specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, respectively. The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are summarized below. All laboratories are performing primary diagnostic functions; therefore, the percentage of specimens testing positive across laboratory types can be used to monitor overall trends in COVID-19 activity. As the outbreak progresses, it is possible that different types of laboratories will take on different roles, and the data interpretation may need to change. * Commercial and clinical laboratory data represents select laboratories and does not capture all tests performed in the United States. * Commercial laboratories began testing for SARS-CoV-2 in early March, but the number and geographic distribution of reporting commercial laboratories became stable enough to calculate a weekly percentage of specimens testing positive as of March 29, 2020. Two syndromic surveillance systems are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors a slightly different syndrome, and together these systems provide a more comprehensive picture of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness than either would individually. Both systems are currently being affected by recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. These changes affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so. F] and cough and/or sore throat) to approximately 2,600 primary care providers, emergency departments and urgent care centers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U. Mild COVID-19 illness presents with symptoms similar to ILI, so ILINet is being used to track trends of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and allows for comparison with prior influenza seasons. Nationwide during week 25, 0. 8% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. This percentage is well below the national baseline of 2. The percentage of visits for ILI in week 25 remains low among all age groups but increased slightly for persons less than 65 years of age. is at levels usually seen during summer months which, along with changes in healthcare seeking behavior and the impact of social distancing, is likely contributing to the low level of ILI activity. * Age-group specific percentages should not be compared to the national baseline. , the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0. 4% during week 25. All ten regions are at low levels and below their region-specific baselines; however, Region 4 (South East) increased from 0. 9% during week 24 to 1. 3% during week 25; Regions 7 (Central), 8 (West) and 9 (South West/Coast) also reported slight increases. Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as we move into summer weeks when lower levels of influenza and other respiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While all regions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlighted here. for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and New York City. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared to the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at or above the mean. The number of jurisdictions at each activity level during week 25 and the change compared to the previous week are summarized in the table below and shown in the following maps. The decreasing percentage of visits for ILI described above are reflected in this week’s ILI activity levels. *Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state and may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the state likely being the more complete. NSSP is a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments and academic and private sector partners to collect, analyze and share electronic patient encounter data received from multiple healthcare settings. To track trends of potential COVID-19 visits, visits for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) (fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code) and ILI to a subset of emergency departments in 47 states are being monitored. Nationwide during week 25, 2. 1% of emergency department visits captured in NSSP were due to CLI and 0. 8% were due to ILI. This is the first week of an increasing percentage of visits for CLI and ILI nationally since activity peaked in early April. (Regions 4 [South East], 6 [South Central] and 9 [South West/Coast]) reported increases in the percentages of visits for both CLI and ILI during week 25. One additional region reported a slight increase in percentage of visits for CLI during week 25 (Region 8 [Mountain]) and 2 additional regions reported a slight increase in percentage of visits for ILI (Regions 3 [Mid-Atlantic] and 7 [Central]). The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in select counties participating in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). A total of 31,934 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were reported by sites between March 1, 2020 and June 20, 2020. The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 98. Among the 0-4 years, 5-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years, and ≥ 65 years age groups, the highest rate of hospitalization is among adults aged ≥ 65 years, followed by adults aged 50-64 years and adults aged 18-49 years. 3%) had information on race and ethnicity while collection of race and ethnicity was still pending for 2,145 (6. Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5 times that of non-Hispanic White persons, while non-Hispanic Black persons and Hispanic or Latino persons each have a rate approximately 4. 5 times that of non-Hispanic White persons. Non-Hispanic White persons represent the highest proportion of hospitalized cases reported to COVID-NET, followed by non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons. However, some racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately represented among hospitalized cases as compared with the overall population of the catchment area. Prevalence ratios show a similar pattern to that of the age-adjusted hospitalization rates: non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have the highest prevalence ratio, followed by non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic or Latino persons. for the denominator. Rates are adjusted to account for differences in age distributions within race/ethnicity strata in the COVID-NET catchment area; the age strata used for the adjustment include 0-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84, and  85 years. Persons of multiple races (0. 2%) or unknown race and ethnicity (6. 2%) are not represented in the table but are included as part of the denominator. Prevalence ratio is calculated as the ratio of the proportion of hospitalized COVID-NET cases over the proportion of population in COVID-NET catchment area. Among 8,089 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 91% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were hypertension, obesity, chronic metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disease. Among 158 hospitalized children with information on underlying conditions, 53. 2% had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported were obesity, asthma, and neurologic conditions. on demographics, signs and symptoms at admission, underlying conditions, interventions, outcomes, and discharge diagnoses, stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity, are available. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) collects death certificate data from vital statistics offices for all deaths occurring in the United States. Based on death certificate data available on June 25, 2020, 6. 9% of all deaths occurring during the week ending June 20, 2020 (week 25) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC). This is the ninth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC; however, the percentage remains above the epidemic threshold of 5. 9% for week 25. Data for recent weeks are incomplete, and the PIC percentage may increase as more death certificates representing deaths during these weeks are processed. Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of death collected from death certificates. Percentages of deaths due to PIC are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported PIC percentages may be lower than percentages calculated from final data. *Data during recent weeks are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes.</data>

			<data> Guidance for U. COVID-19 can affect anyone, and the disease can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe. For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors. CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations. CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners. People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection. Better understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19. Anticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick. Reduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person’s risk. CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below. These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations. Investigation of People with COVID-19 Who Have Symptoms (Symptomatic) vs. Compare characteristics of people with COVID-19 who have symptoms with characteristics of people with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms.

			<data> How does CDC collect COVID-19 surveillance data? is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. For surveillance of COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems in collaboration with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to monitor COVID-19 in the United States. COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources using existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, lab reporting, the healthcare safety system, ongoing research platforms, and other new surveillance systems designed to answer specific questions. The data from these systems, combined, create an updated picture of COVID-19’s spread and its effects in the United States and are used to inform the U. S. national public health response to COVID-19. What are the goals for COVID-19 national surveillance? To understand how COVID-19 impacts the capacity of the U. How are COVID-19 data used? COVID-19 data can be used to help public health professionals, policy makers, and health care providers monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and support better understanding of illness, disease severity, effectiveness of community interventions, and social disruptions associated with COVID-19 in the U. These data help inform U. S. national, state, local, tribal, and territorial public health responses to COVID-19. Detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts. Where can I find information on COVID-19 cases, testing, hospitalizations, deaths, and other surveillance in the United States? Cases in the U. Cases reported in the U. Deaths reported in the U.

The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases reflects the rapid community spread of COVID-19 in many U. means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. and reporting across the country. Why are the death counts for the Cases in the U. S. webpage different from the Provisional Death Counts for COVID-19 webpage? Cases in the U. web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments. This count reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting from health departments. from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday through Friday with information collected from death certificates. These data represent the most accurate death counts. However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, there is on average a delay of 1–2 weeks before they are reported. Therefore, the provisional death counts may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods. Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received. Cases in the U. What does the mortality rate mean? Why does this percentage keep changing? The mortality rate is the percentage of people who died due to COVID-19 out of the total number of people with COVID-19 reported. Since this is an ongoing outbreak, the percentage can change daily. There are several reasons for this, such as there may be delays in reporting of additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and not all COVID-19 cases will be detected. Why do some case numbers reported by state health departments, Johns Hopkins, and the World Health Organization (WHO) sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website? CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ. Case numbers reported on other websites may differ from what is posted on CDC’s website because CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with each jurisdiction. Differences between reporting jurisdictions and CDC’s website may occur due to the timing of reporting and website updates. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by other sites may differ. Does CDC create surveillance reports on COVID-19? CDC is modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19. as part of its COVID-NET surveillance system. to protect people from COVID-19 in a variety of settings. What is CDC COVID Data Tracker? is a website that allows users to interact with a variety of data on COVID-19 that is updated daily. – to capture the impact the virus is having on the United States.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker. Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing. with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit. in the trash. with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. If surfaces are dirty, clean them.

This will help the office protect themselves and other patients. You don’t need to wear the cloth face covering if you are alone. If you can’t put on a cloth face covering (because of trouble breathing, for example), cover your coughs and sneezes in some other way. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from other people. This will help protect the people around you. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2 years, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not able to remove the covering without help.

			<data> The EU has named 14 countries whose citizens are deemed "safe" to be let in from 1 July, despite the pandemic - but the US, Brazil and China are excluded. Those named include Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco and South Korea. The EU is ready to add China if the Chinese government offers a reciprocal deal for EU travellers, diplomats say. Many border controls have been lifted for EU citizens travelling inside the bloc. Rules for UK travellers are part of the current Brexit negotiations. But UK nationals are still to be treated in the same way as EU citizens until the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, the EU Commission says. On the current "safe" list, still likely to be amended, are Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. EU nations in the 26-member Schengen zone normally allow passport-free border crossings for EU citizens, but national authorities have reimposed restrictions in this crisis. The UK is currently negotiating temporary "air bridges" with several EU member states, so that coronavirus does not totally block summer holidays - the busiest season in Europe for tourism, which employs millions of people. How will the UK's air bridges work? How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? The EU procedure to formalise the list, and criteria by which countries are judged safe or not, are to be finalised by midday on Tuesday. A qualified majority of EU countries - at least 55% of the EU countries, representing 65% of the EU population - have signed off on list. There were splits between those such as Spain - wanting the boost of tourism, but preferring to play safe because they have been hit so hard by Covid-19 - and others like Greece and Portugal, which depend on tourism but are less scarred by the virus. You'd think it'd be quite straightforward, deciding which non-EU countries to consider "safe". But it's been a tortuous, divisive process, mixing politics and economics, as well as public health. Countries like Germany and Spain, horrified by the devastation of Covid-19, wanted to play it safe. They pushed to have a short list of countries with low infection rates, a good health service and reliable health data. But Greece and Portugal had other ideas. Anxious to boost their post-lockdown, flagging economies with tourism, and less scarred by widespread infection at the height of the pandemic, they wanted as long a list as possible. Then came France, insisting on reciprocity. If a non-EU country was barring flights from the bloc, argued Paris, they shouldn't appear on the list. How awkward for the EU to include some countries but not others. Thumbs up to visitors from Canada, Japan and China from 1 July - if Beijing allows EU visitors entry - but not travellers from the US. After days of haggling, the final list is an attempted compromise. Much metaphorical sweat, blood and tears for a list that is advisory only, open to exceptions and will be regularly tweaked and updated. Last week reports said member states were assessing two different lists. The Politico website said one covered countries with fewer than 16 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people and the other with up to 20 cases, which would include Canada and Turkey. The list is expected to be revised every two weeks, so the US could be added later. Earlier this month the European Commission also stressed that reopening borders with non-EU states in the Western Balkans was a priority from 1 July. However, EU member Croatia said last week that travellers from Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia and North Macedonia would all face 14-day self-isolation, because of an increase in infections.

			<data> Coronavirus: What are air bridges and which countries can I go to? Passengers travelling between the UK and some countries will no longer have to quarantine, under the government's air bridges scheme. Most people entering the UK currently have to quarantine for two weeks, but the new rules will make travel easier. The list of countries will be announced later this week and come into effect shortly. What are air bridges? Air bridges will allow smoother travel between two countries with relatively low levels of coronavirus. Air bridges are also known as ''travel corridors'' when they include international journeys made via land and sea. The government looks set to introduce them using a traffic light system. This will classify countries as green, amber or red depending on the number of new cases of coronavirus there and how that could change in the near future. Travellers entering the UK from a country in the green or amber category will not have to quarantine. Those travelling from countries in the red category will. It is thought that all incoming passengers will still have to fill in a contact locator form with their personal details and the address of where they will be staying. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? These classifications won't be set in stone - if coronavirus cases rise in the UK or a partner country, either one could decide to close the air bridge and impose restrictions. Equally, more air bridges could be established if infection rates fall in the UK and around the world. Why are air bridges being introduced? since 17 March, but is currently reviewing its advice on this. The guidance is expected to be lifted for countries categorised as green or amber. This will allow Britons to go abroad on holiday or see relatives. It could help the UK receive an economic boost from tourists. While border control is overseen by the UK government, health measures - such as quarantine requirements - are decided by each home nation separately. Which countries are on the list? An initial list of countries which have agreed air bridges with the UK will be announced later this week. More than 15 nations are thought to be on the list, including France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Norway and Finland. but has recently seen a rise in new cases around Lisbon. and has a higher infection rate than the UK, is also unlikely to have made the list. Greece is also likely to be missing from the list. The country, which has reported fewer than 200 coronavirus deaths, says it will not accept direct flights from the UK until at least mid-July.

			<data> Across Europe, lockdown measures are being lifted cautiously, in phases. Businesses are reopening and many children are back in school. Many of Europe's internal borders opened again in mid-June and there are hopes that external borders will be lifted from 1 July - although different nations are lifting border controls at different rates. Here is how Europeans are emerging from life under lockdown. in April: in early May control of lifting the lockdown was handed to the 16 federal states. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that an ''emergency brake'' would be applied anywhere with a surge in new infections. for a week on 23 June. for EU member states and specified European countries including the UK. What caused Germany's biggest virus outbreak? Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home. In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers. and ended regional travel restrictions, and the country entered phase three of its lockdown lifting on 15 June. Cruises on Italian ships remain suspended. France's strict lockdown was imposed on 17 March, with residents required to provide a travel permit justifying any outdoor trips. ", where restrictions can ease faster. on 22 June. will start reopening on 22 June. Denmark, one of the first European countries to announce a lockdown, started to ease restrictions in mid-April, with a four-phase plan. returned on 14 April, with children attending in shifts. The three Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - became the first countries in Europe to allow free movement again, but initially only with each other. From 15 May, citizens and residents could move freely across the three countries, provided they had not travelled outside the Baltic states in the past two weeks, were not infected, and not in contact with an infected person. Those coming from elsewhere still have to self-isolate for 14 days. Estonia then said several countries would not be affected by quarantine from 1 June, including Germany, France and Austria, and the Baltic trio resumed free movement with Poland from mid-June. in a country that has seen a high number of deaths in care homes. from a group of up to four people. also reopened from 18 May, with rules for 1. No public sporting or cultural events can take place before 30 June. The Netherlands imposed a far less strict lockdown than next-door Belgium. , which kicked in from 11 May. A drop in cases meant the country announced plans to ease measures would be brought forward. reopened on 1 June for up to 30 guests inside and unlimited numbers outside, provided people maintain 1. - provided people stick to 1. 5m social distancing. pupils returned to class on 2 June. for Dutch citizens changed on 15 June, meaning they can visit all countries within the EU or Schengen zone without restrictions. Austria was one of the first countries to ease its lockdown. The health minister said the reopening of small shops in mid-April didn't cause a spike in cases. have now been re-opened with all its neighbours. Spain outlined a four-stage plan on 4 May to start easing one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, which saw children under 14 confined to their homes for six weeks. On 1 June, Spain moved to a second phase for 70% of Spaniards, but Madrid, Barcelona and some other regions stayed under tighter phase-one restrictions. The state of emergency officially ended on 21 June, restoring freedom of movement and reopening some borders. People must still stay 1. 5 metres apart in public and wear masks on public transport and when shopping. However, parts of northeastern Spain returned to phase two of lockdown easing in June after an outbreak of the virus among fruit pickers. were partially reopened from 26 May. began reopening on 26 May, but only at 30% capacity. Ireland has had a stricter lockdown than the UK, with residents only allowed to exercise within 2km (1. 2 miles) of their homes. started on 18 May. Switzerland began easing its eight-week lockdown in stages from 27 April. Portugal has had fewer coronavirus cases and deaths than some other south European nations. The government announced a three-phase plan, reopening different sectors of the economy every 15 days. However, on 22 June authorities had to reimpose restrictions in 15 neighbourhoods around Lisbon after local outbreaks. These included the return of an evening curfew and limiting gatherings to 10 people. Greece recorded its first Covid-19 case on 26 February and the government acted swiftly to impose a lockdown. On 28 April, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a relaxation of lockdown measures in the weeks ahead, with a particular focus on opening up the country for the summer. are now all able to reopen. on 15 June with strict rules. President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia's nationwide lockdown was being eased from 12 May, and that businesses could go back to work to stop unemployment rising further. He also said it was up to individual regions to decide the best policy. But Russia's daily infection rate remains high, compared with the rest of Europe. In Poland, Covid-19 numbers are lower than in many Western European countries. Most of the recent infections have been amongst the country's coal miners in the southern Silesia region. Poland began lifting restrictions on 20 April, when parks and forests were allowed to reopen. There was no compulsory lockdown in Sweden, unlike the measures seen elsewhere in Europe. But in line with government advice, most people took to voluntary social distancing and working from home. What's going wrong in Sweden's care homes? Has Sweden got its science right?</data>

			<data> A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been identified in China by scientists. It emerged recently and is carried by pigs, but can infect humans, they say. The researchers are concerned that it could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person, and trigger a global outbreak. While it is not an immediate problem, they say, it has "all the hallmarks" of being highly adapted to infect humans and needs close monitoring. As it's new, people could have little or no immunity to the virus. that measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swiftly implemented. A bad new strain of influenza is among the top disease threats that experts are watching for, even as the world attempts to bring to an end the current coronavirus pandemic. The last pandemic flu the world encountered - the swine flu outbreak of 2009 - was less deadly than initially feared, largely because many older people had some immunity to it, probably because of its similarity to other flu viruses that had circulated years before. Does the UK have coronavirus under control? That virus, called A/H1N1pdm09, is now covered by the annual flu vaccine to make sure people are protected. The new flu strain that has been identified in China is similar to 2009 swine flu, but with some new changes. So far, it hasn't posed a big threat, but Prof Kin-Chow Chang and colleagues who have been studying it, say it is one to keep an eye on. How worried should we be? The virus, which the researchers call G4 EA H1N1, can grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airways. They found evidence of recent infection in people who worked in abattoirs and the swine industry in China when they looked at data from 2011 to 2018. Current flu vaccines do not appear to protect against it, although they could be adapted to do so if needed. Prof Kin-Chow Chang, who works at Nottingham University in the UK, told the BBC: "Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses. While this new virus is not an immediate problem, he says: "We should not ignore it. In theory, a flu pandemic could occur at any time, but they are still rare events. Pandemics happen if a new strain emerges that can easily spread from person to person. Although flu viruses are constantly changing - which is why the flu vaccine also needs to change regularly to keep up - they do not usually go pandemic. Prof James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the work "comes as a salutary reminder" that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of pathogens, and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses.</data>

			<data> As coronavirus spreads in Afghanistan, the cracks in the country's healthcare system - already weakened by decades of war - are starting to show. BBC Pakistan and Afghanistan Correspondent Secunder Kermani reports on the country's worsening Covid-19 crisis. When Ahmad Shah's wife developed coronavirus symptoms, he tried to take her to one of Kabul's government hospitals. But free beds are in short supply in the city, and resources are desperately stretched. Even though she was experiencing breathing difficulties, doctors advised Mr Shah to treat her at home himself. "One told me, 'If you truly love her, please take her home and do the treatment there," Mr Shah told the BBC. He bought his own oxygen supply and mask. Demand has been so high during the pandemic that the price of cylinders has doubled in recent weeks. They now cost around £200. "It's very hard to find oxygen these days," Mr Shah said. "It's not just expensive but you need to know someone in the company selling it to be able to buy it. Doctors say the already weak healthcare system in the war-torn country is struggling to cope with the pressure of Covid-19. Concerns have been raised about the supply of oxygen and other resources to government hospitals. A doctor in Kabul described patients' families having to "fight for oxygen" when cylinders arrived, before bringing it to the intensive care unit themselves. There are issues with testing too. Low levels of testing suggest there are "substantially" more Covid-19 cases than the official figures, according to World Health Organization (WHO) representative for Afghanistan, Dr Rik Peeperkorn. About 31,000 infections have been recorded to date. Close to half of all tests conducted so far have been positive, one of the highest rates in the world. Dr Peeperkorn told the BBC the number of test laboratories would be expanded from 11 to 21 in the "coming months" and called for greater "global solidarity" in ensuring a regular supply of the necessary equipment. One doctor, who wanted to remain anonymous, described a worrying lack of staff in a critical-care unit he worked at in a major state-run Kabul hospital. "One night many patients died because there was no staff to look after them," the doctor said. He said the patients' relatives were "furious" and broke windows at the hospital in anger. The doctor, now working in a private hospital, added that many families were reluctant to seek treatment at public institutions. "They don't trust the quality of the treatment," the doctor said. "They say, 'take as much money as you want but get our patient admitted. But private hospitals too, he added, are routinely having to turn patients away due to a lack of beds. How long does it take to get better? What are the symptoms? How close are we to finding one? WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE BODY? Another doctor told the BBC even staff members at his private hospital were unable to get their own family members treated. "A doctor rang and said, 'One of my relatives is having breathing problems, we are sending him to you, please admit him. ' I asked him for forgiveness… We couldn't look after his relative, so think what happens to ordinary people who come here? Afghanistan's healthcare system was already under-resourced before the pandemic - those needing medical care would often travel to neighbouring Pakistan or India for treatment if they could afford it. Many of the doctors who spoke to the BBC blamed corruption for the current lack of staff and equipment in government hospitals. One described the situation as "frustrating and depressing". There has been a spate of investigative reports in local media in the past few weeks, and public anger is rising. Officials are investigating a story by Pajhwok Afghan News, alleging that 32 ventilators were stolen from the Health Ministry and smuggled to Pakistan for sale. In another case, an employee of the health department was arrested for allegedly demanding an $80,000 bribe in order to complete a contract with a company producing protective equipment for medical staff. Lotfullah Najafizada, head of Tolo News, told the BBC that corruption was "a huge issue" across the government, but in particular at the moment in the Health Ministry because of the extra resources that have been recently allocated to tackle Covid-19. "The ministry never managed this amount of money in the past," he said, adding that the urgency meant "you can't put an efficient oversight process in place". It's difficult to assess the true scale of coronavirus in Afghanistan. A doctor working in Kabul suggested the health system might be overwhelmed largely because "capacity is so low". However, anecdotal reports from graveyards suggest they have seen significant rises in the number of burials. A sense of stigma attached to the disease means many families are reluctant to acknowledge deaths from coronavirus. One doctor from the southern city of Kandahar told the BBC it was clear even from his own social circle that a large number of people are dying. "If you look at Facebook, on a daily basis there is an increased number of deaths," he said. He said in most cases the deaths were said to be the result of "typhoid" - a bacteria infection - or "unknown causes", but that he was "100% sure it was due to Covid-19". The doctor, who normally treats victims of Afghanistan's war, said years of conflict and tragedy had desensitised some of the city's residents to the deaths, which they described as "the will of God". Meanwhile, the violence in the country continues, with an increase in Taliban attacks and targeted killings by unknown militants in the capital Kabul. Healthcare workers are at times directly affected. , killing sixteen expectant mothers, among others. The UN has also documented a dozen other violent incidents, including the repeated abduction of medical staff by the Taliban, and one instance of government security forces looting medical supplies. Concerns are also rising about the impact of coronavirus on both levels of poverty in the country, and efforts to tackle other diseases. Afghanistan is one of only two countries in the world yet to eradicate wild polio, but vaccination campaigns have been suspended. In recent weeks polio cases have been discovered in provinces that were previously considered polio free. Dr Peeperkorn, from the WHO, told the BBC it was crucial that "fragile" progress made in the last decade - in reducing the infant mortality rate, for example - was not rolled back as a result of increasing public distrust of the health system or a lack of investment due to economic pressures. For doctors on the frontline, the immediate priority is getting the support they need to look after coronavirus patients. According to the WHO, more than $5 million worth of medical supplies has been procured so far, with $17 million worth of equipment due in the coming weeks. It is much needed. "It feels really bad to see our own people dying in front of us," said one doctor, wearily, from the western city of Herat, where the country's outbreak began. "We are the same as doctors anywhere else in the world, but we don't have the beds, staff or resources," he said.</data>

			<data> Volunteers in India will be immunised with a new locally made coronavirus vaccine in July. An unspecified number of people will have the vaccine, as part of a trial by Hyderabad-based firm Bharat Biotech. Tests in animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. The trials are among many across the world - there are around 120 vaccine programmes under way. Half a dozen Indian firms are developing vaccines. This is the first India-made vaccine and developed from a strain of the virus that was isolated locally and weakened under laboratory conditions. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? India's drug control authorities have allowed Bharat Biotech to hold Phase 1 and 2 of clinical human trials after "company submitted results generated from preclinical studies, demonstrating safety and immune response", a statement issued by the firm added. The two trials are designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather than whether it is effective. The locally obtained strain of the virus was instrumental in developing the vaccine quickly, the firm said. "The difference between the strains present globally is something still being researched," a spokesperson for the vaccine maker told the BBC. The vaccine is called Covaxin and has been locally developed in collaboration with India's National Institute of Virology and Indian Council of Medical Research, according to Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech. , among other diseases. Apart from Bharat Biotech, Zydus Cadilla is working on two vaccines, while Biological E, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are developing a vaccine each. Another four or five home-grown vaccines are in early stages of development. Pune-based Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by number of doses produced and sold globally, has also partnered to mass produce a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and backed by the UK government. India is among the largest manufacturer of generic drugs and vaccines in the world. It is home to half a dozen major vaccine makers and a host of smaller ones, making doses against polio, meningitis, pneumonia, rotavirus, BCG, measles, mumps and rubella, among other diseases. Correspondents say a vaccine would normally take years, if not decades, to develop. Most experts think a coronavirus vaccine is likely to become available by mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus, known officially as Sars-CoV-2, first emerged. That would be a huge scientific feat and there are no guarantees it will work, correspondents say. Coronavirus: What is a vaccine and how is one made?</data>

			<data> The spread of coronavirus infections has taken a "swift and very dangerous turn" in the US state of Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has warned. "Over just the past few weeks, the daily number of cases have gone from an average of about 2,000, to more than 5,000," Mr Abbott said on Sunday. Several southern and western states have recorded a surge in cases after lockdown restrictions were eased. The number of reported infections in the US has now surpassed 2. Over 125,000 Covid-19-related deaths have been confirmed nationwide - more than in any other country. Is the pandemic getting worse in the US? Where are global cases rising and falling? , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University in the US. What's the latest on the surge in US cases? The spike has led officials in Texas, Florida and other states to tighten restrictions on business again, with warnings that hospitals may soon be overwhelmed. On Sunday, Mr Abbott said that as many as 5,000 people a day were being diagnosed with the virus. US Vice-President Mike Pence said that Texas would be issued additional Covid-19 testing kits for as long was necessary. "We are going to make sure that Texas, and your healthcare system in Texas, have the resources, have the supplies, have the personnel to meet this moment," Mr Pence said. The vice-president also urged Texans to wear masks "wherever it's indicated", saying "we know from experience, it will slow the spread of the coronavirus". Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was speaking at a joint news conference with Governor Abbott on Sunday, said that a nationwide mandate to wear face coverings was "definitely long overdue". "We have the worst record of any country in the world," she added. In the Texas state capital of Austin, a requirement to wear face coverings in some circumstances in order to help mitigate the spread of the virus led to demonstrations on the city's streets by people objecting to the measure. On Sunday, Arizona also recorded a record daily increase of more than 3,800 cases. Hundreds of people reportedly travelled to rivers in the state to escape the hot weather. The reported increases in infections in southern and western states come after moves in recent weeks to reopen businesses, resulting in people from other areas pouring in. BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? Responding to the level of new cases, Mr Abbott last week told bars to close and limited restaurants' indoor seating capacity to 50%. Restaurants had previously been allowed to operate at 75% capacity, and bars at 50%. In the Texan town of Galena Park, east of Houston, the mayor imposed an overnight curfew on Saturday and warned that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also re-imposed restrictions, ordering bars in the state to stop serving alcohol on their premises. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered bars to close in Los Angeles and six other counties on Sunday, warning that the virus had "not gone away". He urged people to wear masks, follow guidance on hygiene and to "take this seriously". Should US case rises worry us? New coronavirus cases have been swiftly rising in more than half of US states and experts are worried. The number of daily cases had been declining in May and early June - but as many places continued to ease lockdown restrictions, cases began to rise again, hitting a record high of 47,341 a day on 26 June. This is not a second wave of infections, rather a resurgence of the disease that had shown signs of being brought under control. Some of the hardest-hit states, including Texas and Florida, have tightened restrictions again to try to bring down infection rates and avoid hospitals becoming overwhelmed. There is a lag of a few weeks from infection to possible death, so it is not easy to draw an immediate correlation. And, additionally, much will depend on who the new cases are - if they are fit young people, then there will not be a similar rise in deaths. Rising infections are worrying, regardless, because higher rates in the community mean a higher chance of it getting out of control and infecting vulnerable groups. Leading US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has said the next two weeks will be critical. What is the overall situation in the US? On Sunday, Johns Hopkins University said the total number of cases in the country had risen to 2,548,991. While some of the rise was down to more extensive testing, the rate of positive tests in some areas is also increasing. than the confirmed total. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has said that up to 20 million Americans may have been infected. The surge in cases was being driven by young people - those aged between 18 and 34 - testing positive, especially in the south and west of the US, said the head of the CDC, Dr Robert Redfield. What are the symptoms? Will we ever shake hands again? Covid-19 emerged in China late last year and spread across the globe. Coronavirus cases around the world have now passed 10 million, Johns Hopkins reports. Half the world's cases have been in the US and Europe, but the virus is now rapidly growing in the Americas.</data>

			<data> Singapore has started to hand out Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing devices as part of its measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The so-called TraceTogether tokens are an alternative to the government's contact tracing smartphone app. They are aimed at people who do not own or prefer not to use a mobile phone. The announcement of the device was met with concerns in some quarters over privacy. The first batch of the devices are being distributed to vulnerable elderly people who have little or no family support or have mobility problems. The tokens have unique QR codes and do not need charging as they have a battery life of up to nine months. Does anyone have a working contact-tracing app? What went wrong with the coronavirus app? The devices work by exchanging Bluetooth signals with other nearby TraceTogether tokens or smartphones that are running the TraceTogether app. Users will be alerted by a contact tracing officer if they are detected to have been near someone infected with the coronavirus. If they are then confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 the data will be downloaded from the device. Ministers have dismissed concerns raised over users' privacy, as they argued that they are not designed to tag people's movements. The Singapore government has said that the data collected by the devices will be encrypted and kept in the token for a maximum of 25 days. Authorities have also said that the data cannot be accessed remotely as the tokens have no internet or cellular capabilities. Another feature highlighted by the government is that the tokens have no Global Positioning System (GPS) connectivity, so do not collect location data. The Singaporean government has said that since it launched its TraceTogether smartphone app in March is has been downloaded by around 2. 1 million people. Authorities have said that they need to raise participation in the TraceTogether programme significantly as Singapore has started to reopen its economy. Earlier this month the Singapore government started to ease its so-called Circuit Breaker lockdown measures, including non-essential retail stores reopening and eating-in allowed again at food and drinks outlets. The tokens were sourced from a Singapore-based electronics company PCI. It was announced earlier this month that the company had won the SGD6 million (£3. 3m) tender to supply the first 300,000 devices, which works out at SGD20 per token. On Sunday authorities reported a total of 213 new infections in Singapore, 11 of which were in the community with the balance in foreign workers' dormitories. That brought the total number of Covid-19 cases to 43,459.</data>

			<data> Coronavirus: What is dexamethasone and how does it work? An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. What is the drug? Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. How does it work? This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells. Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. How effective is it? According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. What was the trial? The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. How widely available is the drug? Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. The drug costs from £5. 40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. What's reaction been worldwide? The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. What other conditions is it used for? The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Are there any side-effects? Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were "no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population". Do other steroids work? Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-
were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. "It's been a huge ongoing debate," says Prof Horby. What are they and how to guard against them? How is it being lifted?</data>

			<data> Coronavirus misinformation is flooding the internet. A UK parliamentary sub-committee is asking members of the public to submit examples. The committee has particularly requested submissions of disinformation spread in private groups and closed apps such as WhatsApp. Meanwhile, experts are calling on the public to practise "information hygiene". So what can you do to stop the spread of bad information online? You want to help family and friends and keep them in the loop. So when you receive fresh advice - whether by email, WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter - you might quickly forward it on to them. But experts say the number one thing you can do to halt misinformation is to simply stop and think. If you have any doubts, pause, and check it out further. Before you forward it on, ask some basic questions about where the information comes from. It's a big red flag if the source is "a friend of a friend" or "my aunt's colleague's neighbour". Some of the details in the post were accurate - some versions, for example, encouraged hand washing to slow the spread of the virus. But other details were potentially harmful, making unproven claims about how to diagnose the illness. in the USA. Experts are not infallible. But they are much more reliable than a stranger's distant relative on WhatsApp. Who do you trust for health advice? 3. Could it be a fake? Appearances can be deceptive. It is possible to impersonate official accounts and authorities, including BBC News and the government. Screenshots can also be changed to make it look like information has come from a trusted public body. Check known and verified accounts and websites. If you can't easily find the information, it might be a hoax. And if a post, video or a link looks fishy - it probably is. Capital letters and mismatched fonts are something fact-checkers use as an indicator a post might be misleading, according to Claire Milne from Full Fact. Don't forward things on "just in case" they might be true. You might be doing more harm than good. Often we post things into places where we know there are experts - like doctors or medical professionals. That might be OK, but make sure you're very clear about your doubts. And beware - that photo or text you share might later be stripped of its context. There's a voice note that has been circulating on WhatsApp. The person speaking in the note says she's translating advice from a "colleague who has a friend" working at a hospital. It's been sent to the BBC by dozens of people around the world. But it's a mix of accurate and inaccurate advice. When you get sent long lists of advice, it's easy to believe everything in them just because you know for certain that one of the tips (say, about hand washing) is true. But that's not always the case. What misinformation has spread in Africa? It's the stuff that gets us fearful, angry, anxious, or joyful that tends to really go viral. , an organisation that helps journalists tackle online misinformation. Urgent calls for action are designed to ramp up anxiety - so be careful. "People want to help their loved ones stay safe, so when they see 'Tips for preventing the virus! ' or 'Take this health supplement! ' people want to do whatever they can to help," she says. Are you sharing something because you know it's true - or just because you agree with it? , says we're more likely to share posts that reinforce our existing beliefs. "It's when we're angrily nodding our head that we're most vulnerable," he says. "That's when, above everything else, we just need to slow down everything that we do online. Have you seen misleading information - or something you have doubts about?</data>

			<data> Right at the moment when the prime minister is planning to turn the page to usher in a different political phase, the reinstatement of some restrictions on people's lives in Leicester is a reminder that the risk to our health from the coronavirus crisis is neither gone, nor forgotten. Ministers have been clear for some weeks that the possibility of 'local lockdowns' was very real. And the announcement from the health secretary on Monday evening was not just to put the brakes on easing of elements of the lockdown, he has also reversed some of changes that have already been made: closing non-essential shops again, and schools - aside from the children of key workers, or the vulnerable - restricted. It is not a small ask of the people of Leicester, a major city, to watch the rest of the country progress, while they have to go into reverse for now, to protect everyone's health. How would a local lockdown work in your area? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? But this kind of on, and off, measure may become a regular feature of how the government tries to manage the infection as the months pass. And there are already questions from opposition politicians about why speculation was allowed to build over the last few days about whether it was going to happen at all. Local leaders expressed significant frustration, too, at a lack of coordination and information sharing about exactly what was going on. using echoes of the past, the New Deal that took the United States out of the Great Depression, to try to show that the government has the imagination and the drive to move the country out of the worst phases of the pandemic. But just as he and the Cabinet are starting to focus on the risk of very widespread financial hardship, what's happening in Leicester makes it clear that the balance between managing public health and how the country makes its living is still precarious too.</data>

			<data> Should more of us wear face masks to help slow the spread of coronavirus? World Health Organization (WHO). The group will weigh up research on whether the virus can be projected further than previously thought; a study in the US suggests coughs can reach 6m and sneezes up to 8m. The panel's chair, Prof David Heymann, told BBC News that the new research may lead to a shift in advice about masks. The former director at the WHO explained: "The WHO is opening up its discussion again looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it's recommending masks should be used. What is the current advice? The WHO recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m from anyone coughing or sneezing to avoid the risk of infection. It says people who are sick and show symptoms should wear masks. Who should be wearing masks? But it advises that healthy people only need to wear them if they are caring for others suspected of being infected or if they themselves are coughing or sneezing. It emphasises that masks are only effective if combined with frequent hand-washing and used and disposed of properly. The UK, along with other countries including the US, advises that social distancing should mean staying at least 2m apart. This advice is based on evidence showing that viruses can only be transmitted while carried within drops of liquid. The understanding is that most of those drops will either evaporate or fall to the ground near to the person who released them. So what does the new research say? assess precisely what happens after a cough or sneeze. They found that an exhalation generates a small fast-moving cloud of gas that can contain droplets of liquid of varying sizes - and that the smallest of these can be carried in the cloud over long distances. The study - conducted in laboratory conditions - found that coughs can project liquid up to 6m away and that sneezes, which involve much higher speeds, can reach up to 8m away. How do I protect myself? What are the implications? The scientist who led the study, Prof Lydia Bourouiba of MIT, told me that she is concerned about the current concept of "safe distances". "What we exhale, cough or sneeze is a gas cloud that has high momentum that can go far, traps the drops of all sizes in it and carries them through the room," she said. "So having this false idea of safety at one to two metres, that somehow drops will just fall to the ground at that distance is not based on what we have quantified, measured and visualised directly. Does this change the advice about masks? Prof Bourouiba's view is that in certain situations, especially indoors in poorly ventilated rooms, wearing masks would reduce the risks. For example, when facing someone who's infected, masks could help divert the flow of their breath and its load of virus away from your mouth. "Flimsy masks are not going to protect from inhaling the smallest particulates in the air because they do not provide filtration," Prof Bourouiba said. "But they would potentially divert the cloud that is being emitted with high momentum to the side instead of forward. What do the WHO advisers think? According to Prof Heymann, the new research from MIT and other institutions will be evaluated because it suggests that droplets from coughs and sneezes could be projected further than originally thought. He said that if the evidence is supported, then "it might be that wearing a mask is equally as effective or more effective than distancing. But he adds a warning that masks need to be worn properly, with a seal over the nose. If they become moist, Prof Heymann explained, then particles can pass through. People must remove them carefully to avoid their hands becoming contaminated. He adds that masks need to be worn consistently. "It's not on to wear a mask and then decide to take it off to smoke a cigarette or eat a meal - it must be worn full time," he said. The panel, known as the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards, is due to hold its next virtual meeting in the next few days. A spokesperson for Public Health England said there was little evidence of widespread benefit from wearing masks outside clinical settings. "Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. "Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods. Aren't countries changing their advice on masks anyway? Long popular in many countries in Asia, masks are now being assessed for public use by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Austria, the police now wear them and anyone dealing with the police will have to wear one too. Supermarkets there will insist that customers do too. A once-rare sight in Europe is becoming more common, and new advice from the WHO would accelerate that change.</data>

			<data> People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Should I be wearing one? Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks. Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly. When will children be returning? What are the guidelines on getting out? How many cases in your area?</data>

			<data> Coronavirus cure: What progress are we making on treatments? There are a significant number of studies underway into potential treatments for Covid-19. And some progress has been made in the search for effective medicines. What work is being done to find treatments? More than 150 different drugs are being researched around the world. Most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus. with more than 11,000 patients taking part. help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. What types of drugs might work? What are the most promising coronavirus drugs? Dexamethasone, the first drug shown to save the lives of people with Covid-19, has been hailed as a breakthrough. showed the low-cost steroid cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and a fifth for those on oxygen. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. This can prompt the immune system to go into overdrive, and it's this reaction that can prove fatal. Dexamethasone damps down this response. What is dexamethasone and how does it work? A US-led trial of over 1,000 people worldwide found remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days to 11. Some were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment. It is one of the four drugs in the Solidarity trial and its manufacturer, Gilead, is also organising trials. However, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - studies have so far not given any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus. It is thought that antivirals may be more effective in the early stages, and immune drugs later in the disease. The UK government has made both dexamethasone and remdesivir available on the NHS. What do I need to know about the coronavirus? When will life get back to normal? What can I do? What are the symptoms? Can HIV drugs treat coronavirus? There has been much talk, but little evidence, that a pair of HIV drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - could be effective at treating coronavirus. have been disappointing. The combination did not improve recovery, reduce deaths or lower levels of the virus in patients with serious Covid-19. However, as the trial was conducted with extremely sick patients (nearly a quarter died) it may have been too late in the infection for the drugs to work. Can malaria drugs stop coronavirus? Malaria drugs are part of both the Solidarity and Recovery trials. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, may have antiviral and immune-calming properties. but there is still scant evidence on their effectiveness. Hydroxychloroquine is also used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, because it can help regulate the immune system. , but there are growing concerns about its use against the disease. It has now been pulled from that trial. following a large-scale study in the Lancet. That found the drug's use can cause heart problems, and actually increased the likelihood of death. The WHO says there is no definitive evidence of its effectiveness. Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? Can survivors' blood treat coronavirus? People who survive an infection should have antibodies in their blood that can attack the virus. The idea is you take the blood plasma (the part which contains the antibodies) and give that to a sick patient as a therapy. The US has already treated 500 patients with what's known as "convalescent plasma", and other countries are getting involved too. How long until we have a cure? It is too soon to know when we might have a drug that can treat the coronavirus. However, we should start to get the results of trials in the next few months. (which protects against infection rather than treat it) is effective. This is because doctors are testing drugs that have already been developed and are known to be safe enough to use, whereas vaccines researchers are starting from scratch. Some completely new, experimental, coronavirus drugs are also being tested in the laboratory but are not yet ready for human tests. Why do we need a treatment? The most obvious reason for wanting a treatment is it will save lives, but it could also allow further lockdown measures to be lifted. Having an effective treatment would, in essence, make coronavirus a milder disease. If it stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation, then there would be less risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed, so controls on people's lives may not need to be as strict.</data>

			<data> After years of living with others, Lucia was excited to finally have a place to herself. The photographer had recently moved back to Italy from New York. She enjoyed spending time on long, meandering walks with her camera, and going out for food with friends. But within a couple of months Milan, where she lived, had become the epicentre of Europe's coronavirus outbreak. She and millions of other Italians were ordered into lockdown, told to stay home unless absolutely necessary. The first few weeks were the hardest, as the monotony of days isolated in her apartment took its toll. But now more than a month on, Lucia is adjusting to being alone. She still misses her freedom and physical contact with others, but feels fortunate that she and her loved ones are healthy, when so many across her country have died. "Sometimes I get worried about the future, about how life will be after this ends," she says. "I wonder if there will ever be a real life outside our homes. Almost 4,000 miles away, the only human faces Aparna sees now belong to security guards. The 26-year-old lives alone in her mother's old apartment in Gurgaon, near Delhi. Twice a day she leaves to walk her dogs, Jules and Yogi, as the guards keep watch over her complex's locked gates. Aparna has only ventured beyond them once. There are millions more stories like this around the world. As governments scramble to contain the deadly Covid-19 pandemic by restricting public life, many living alone have had to accept that they might not spend time with anyone else for a long time. I know because I'm among them. Weeks into the UK lockdown, my ordinary life in London goes on but it looks and feels different. Trips to the office have become a rarity. I feel lucky to have a cat for company and the ability to go outside for walks when others can't, but it's hard not knowing when I'll next see my close friends or family, who live hundreds of miles away. What are social distancing and self-isolation rules? These days the same screens that host our work meetings carry the burden of our social lives too. With the exception of conversations over the telecom or chance encounters with neighbours by the bins, all of my human contact is now online. Daily screen-time gone up during isolation? With so many other people across the world living by themselves through this strange experience, I decided to try to find expert advice and others self-isolating alone. That's how I found Lucia, Aparna and Angie: three women continents apart, going through the same. Angie, from Maine, has lived by herself for four years. Getting her own space became an important part of her growth and healing after a divorce. But as the US became gripped by coronavirus and local restrictions hit, the downfalls of her living situation became apparent. A couple of weeks ago, when Angie was laid-off from work, she was left to deal with it alone. "In normal circumstances, if you were to lose your job, you'd be met with a hug by a family member or invited over by a friend for cheering up," she says. There is plenty of research to suggest our social relationships can be as important to our physical health as our mental one. Research links pervasive loneliness to higher mortality rates and other health complications. Professor Naomi Eisenberger is a social psychologist at UCLA known for her research on how the brain behaves when it experiences social rejection and disconnect. She says our current situation, with billions of people cut-off from their normal lives, is unprecedented. She stresses the importance of people living alone trying to stay connected with those we care about. "One of the things I've heard from people is that it's interesting that now you start realising who you actually feel close to, because it doesn't matter who lives near you or who is easy to get to," she says. Her research group is also looking into whether the virtual communication we are all currently filling our schedules with is enough to feel truly connected. Professor Stephanie Cacioppo, an expert in behavioural neuroscience and psychiatry at the University of Chicago, is also full of practical tips for those living alone. She and her late husband were known for their pioneering research that draws a distinction between being alone and feeling lonely. She says adjusting our mindset and expectations is key to avoiding feelings of loneliness. This means accepting events are beyond our control and knowing that being away from the people and things we love is only temporary. "Right now you live alone. And right now you have no choice. So you can either scream all day long or make the most of it," Dr Cacioppo says. For Angie, this has meant reconnecting with her art. She's started posting daily illustrations - which we have used throughout this feature - as a way to share her emotions and perspective on living alone through the pandemic. Her nameless, faceless character is seen living out quiet and relatable personal moments. "When I start to feel alone, I imagine other people like me, feeling the same emotions or doing the same things in that very moment all around the world," she says. "It helps me feel grounded and connected. Another practical task to try and stay grounded, Dr Cacioppo suggests, is keeping a journal of your emotions during isolation: making note of the things that make you feel happy or accomplished throughout the day. "People have done studies showing that self-compassion or a gratitude towards others, but also towards yourself, can really improve the well-being and happiness level," she says. These acts of kindness don't need to be time-consuming or expensive, she explains. "Everyone has their own things that are really good for self-care. Both experts I spoke to stressed the importance of building routine into our days in self-isolation, explaining that regular social contact can help regulate us in all kinds of ways, down to our sleeping and eating patterns. Dr Cacioppo advises people to plan life only in the short-term, even one or two days ahead. "We have all lost control of our reality. We had schedules, we had activities planned," she says. "We could just see the schedule of next week and we knew exactly what we would do and now it's a little bit different. Trying to set three manageable goals per day, she suggests, can help instil a feeling of accomplishment. "Then you can go to bed more peaceful because you know that you have a structure and something to do - a purpose - for tomorrow," Dr Cacioppo says. This importance of feeling a part of something larger is something that comes up time and time again. In California, another woman has created an online movement achieving just that. On 30 March writer Olivia Gatwood posted a photograph of herself on Instagram captioned: "Self-portrait of a lady in quarantine. Soon dozens, then hundreds, of other women around the world sent her their own. , connecting women across the globe within this strange, shared but disparate reality we now are living. Aparna was one of those who submitted a self-portrait. The lockdown prompted her to pick up her camera for the first time in more than a year and she has been documenting her life under the pandemic since. When asked what advice she would give others, she had a simple message: "Listen to yourself and be kind to yourself, you can finally take the time to do nothing/everything/anything without guilt or compromise. Dr Cacioppo says one positive that may come from the unrelenting tragedy of the outbreak is that, as nations and as people, we could end up feeling more connected than ever before. It's a sentiment Aparna agrees with. "This situation reminds us how vulnerable we are and more importantly how equally vulnerable," she says. "It's become easier than ever before to relate to other human beings across the world and that's something both essential and beautiful to recognise, even in trying times such as these.

			<data>Coronavirus: What is the true death toll of the pandemic?
Read more about sharing. At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research. A review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus. These so-called "excess deaths", the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world. Some will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors. Explore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK. An animated guide: What are excess deaths? Let's use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. and is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years. . During the coronavirus pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year. . But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths. may have been, directly or indirectly, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the coronavirus outbreak. Directly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the virus and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts. As the virus has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times. In some places, the number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels. Analysing deaths from all causes during the outbreak and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the coronavirus pandemic's true death toll. Read through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the pandemic. more people dying than usual. The UK's peak came during the week ending 17 April, with more than 12,800 excess deaths registered. According to ONS data, 9,495 of them mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. London, for a long time the UK's coronavirus hotspot, has recorded the highest number of excess deaths since the outbreak began. But all of the UK's regions have seen excess mortality, with the West Midlands and the North West registering about 50% more deaths than usual during the pandemic. While all parts of the UK have moved past the peak, Wales and the North West of England saw the highest rates of excess deaths in the week ending 5 June. The number of UK coronavirus deaths in the totals above includes all deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate. This will differ from the total number of deaths with a positive test result announced each day by the Department of Health and Social Care. more people dying than usual. Above-average deaths in Austria during the country's outbreak were recorded throughout March and April, with the peak coming during the week ending 12 April. Austria's biggest clusters of coronavirus cases were in Vorarlberg and Tyrol, where a number of ski resorts were sealed off in mid-March. Hundreds of tourists from across Europe are believed to have become infected at these locations. more people dying than usual. Belgium is one of the world's worst-affected countries when it comes to the number of deaths recorded in relation to the size of its population. Belgian officials say this is because of the way they are measuring deaths from Covid-19. The country records confirmed Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and care homes, but the official tally also includes deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases. This is reflected in Belgium's mortality statistics - with coronavirus casualties accounting for all of its excess deaths after the first few weeks. Belgium recorded some excess deaths at the start of the pandemic above those officially put down to the virus. But over the course of Belgium's first wave, there were no excess deaths that could not be attributed to official Covid-19 deaths. This means that, overall, Belgium had no other excess deaths during the period covered by the outbreak. more people dying than usual. *The data for Brazil includes just the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Manaus, Recife, Sao Luis and Fortaleza. Expected deaths are the number of deaths recorded in the equivalent period in 2019. Brazil has the world's second-highest overall death toll from Covid-19 and the number of fatalities are still on the rise. The country's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has received criticism at home and abroad for downplaying the escalating outbreak and flouting health advice on social distancing. The mayor of São Paulo has said the health system in Brazil's largest city could collapse this month as demand grows for emergency beds to deal with coronavirus cases. more people dying than usual. Since mid-May, Chile has been reporting the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America, and a steadily rising number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. The outbreak has hit some regions harder than others, with certain parts of Santiago Metropolitan Region bearing the greatest burden - up to half of all confirmed cases and more than half of all deaths. more people dying than usual. Denmark was one of the first European countries to impose a lockdown, announcing restrictions on 11 March before having recorded a coronavirus death. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been close to normal levels, and deaths from Covid-19 outnumber all other excess deaths during that period. more people dying than usual. Ecuador was one of the first Latin American countries to report a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in early April. In the period from March to May, more than twice as many people died in the country compared with previous years. The number of excess deaths for these three months is five times higher than Ecuador's official Covid-19 total. The vast majority of these above-average deaths were reported in the province of Guayas, home to the key port of Guayaquil. It is thought that many cases have gone unreported because of Ecuador's relatively low rates of testing. more people dying than usual. France only included deaths from Covid-19 ocurring in hospitals at the start of its outbreak, adding deaths in care homes into its toll from early April. The number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 have accounted for almost of all of its excess deaths since the start of France's outbreak. The country's peak came in the week ending 5 April, with more than 7,000 deaths above average. France's coronavirus hotspot has been the capital city Paris and the surrounding area. About a third of all official coronavirus deaths recorded in France have been registered in care homes, according to government figures. more people dying than usual. Excess deaths in Germany have been much lower than other European countries like France, Italy, Spain and the UK. Germany's period of excess deaths spanned the weeks between 23 March and 3 May. Its highest count of above-average fatalities occurred in the week ending 12 April, with 13% more deaths. Over the country's entire outbreak period, deaths attributed to Covid-19 were more than the unspecified excess deaths. more people dying than usual. While all-cause mortality data is not available for all of Indonesia, information on the number of burials in the capital city Jakarta is a good measure of the pandemic's impact on mortality. There were more than 4,700 burials in cemeteries in Jakarta compared with the historic average for the months of March, April and May. The number of these excess funerals in the city is nine times higher than the official death toll from Covid-19. Even on Indonesia's Ambon Island, where statistics show no-one has died from Covid-19, one family told us how the circumstances created by the virus cost their three-year-old son his life. Three-year-old Rafa was rejected by multiple hospitals before he died from leukaemia. more people dying than usual. Iran releases mortality statistics quarterly. The most recent figures are from the "winter" period. It is not possible to say above-average deaths were necessarily due to the coronavirus pandemic. Particularly over winter, with normally high death counts due to seasonal flu or severe weather, these extra deaths may have been attributed to any number of factors during the three months. Iran's outbreak began in late February, and has already claimed the lives of several senior members of government and thousands of ordinary Iranian citizens. As Covid-19 began to sweep across Iran, Omid was well aware of the dangers. The 66-year-old had previously had heart and prostate conditions – so he knew his risk was high. Omid had kept fit. He loved mountaineering, and before the outbreak he exercised daily. "He was very careful and went into quarantine," says his son Mojeed from the north-western city of Ardabil, "but he didn't know the virus could take his life indirectly. While self-isolating, Omid began to suffer from minor bleeding which he put down to haemorrhoids. As it became heavier, his family debated taking him to a doctor. "It was Eid and most of the private medics were already closed under lockdown," says Mojeed. "The government hospitals were busy with Covid-19 patients and it was risky to visit. Omid did manage to see his GP, who said further tests were needed. The former teacher waited 20 days for private medical centres to reopen. There, doctors suspected an intestinal ulcer and advised him to go to a public hospital for an ultrasound - but his family worried, having heard all hospitals now posed a "huge risk" of Covid. For the next month Omid remained at home without treatment. He died after a massive stroke. Omid's family say they struggle to accept his death, particularly because he had taken such care to protect himself. Mojeed remembers his father as friendly and funny. "He advised everyone that you should enjoy your life today because you are alive, and you don't know about the future. more people dying than usual. Note: The data for Italy is a representative sample accounting for 94% of the population. Italy was the first country in Europe to impose a national lockdown in early March as the infection rate spiralled in the country's northern regions. The country's outbreak was highly concentrated in the north, where a large majority of the excess deaths have been recorded. Reported deaths in the hardest-hit region of Lombardy were more than double the number expected for the first eight weeks of the outbreak. Other northern regions, such as Piedmont, recorded 50% more deaths than normal, while some central and southern regions actually saw fewer deaths than usual. In Lazio, which includes the capital city of Rome, deaths were down more than 5% compared with the previous five years. more people dying than usual. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus case in January 2020, but its overall count of Covid-19 deaths remains low. Japan has not prioritised mass testing for coronavirus, unlike its neighbour South Korea. Yet Japan's lack of excess deaths suggests the virus has not had a major impact on the country. more people dying than usual. The peak in the Netherlands came during the week ending 5 April, as the country recorded more than 5,000 deaths, some 2,000 above normal. In recent weeks, the number of deaths in the country has returned to the level expected in an average year. more people dying than usual. Norway has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths in total. Its preliminary mortality data indicates that deaths from all causes during its outbreak have been at normal levels, causing the number of excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus to be balanced out by official Covid-19 fatalities. Experts have suggested that the winter flu season is likely to have been less deadly than in previous years, which may have contributed to low fatalities overall. more people dying than usual. According to national statistics, Peru's outbreak has spread quickly since it began in early March. The government declared strict lockdown measures and issued nationwide safety recommendations a mere 10 days after the first case was confirmed. Yet the country's all-cause mortality data has revealed what coronavirus statistics alone did not capture: a national death toll well above average and far greater than confirmed Covid-19 deaths alone. more people dying than usual. Portugal's excess deaths peaked during the week ending 12 April, with about 500 more deaths registered than usual. The country's foreign minister recently said he hoped that an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. more people dying than usual. Russia's national mortality data is not yet available for the period of the pandemic, but the data for its two largest cities alone reveal a pattern of excess deaths. The capital city, Moscow, reported total death figures in April that were 17% higher than the five-year average. In St Petersburg, the coronavirus outbreak began slightly later. Its total reported deaths for April were about as expected. In May, both cities saw a sharp rise in reported deaths. fewer people dying than usual. Serbia's coronavirus outbreak has been relatively small, with no more than 10 deaths per day according to official statistics. The country recorded its first death from Covid-19 on 20 March, and the next day the government rolled out harsh restrictions on movement. It remains to be seen whether data for future months will show similar evidence of a contained outbreak. fewer people dying than usual. South Africa's mortality statistics look rather different to those of other nations. The total number of reported deaths has been far below what was expected. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a strict nationwide lockdown that began on 26 March, after which the country saw a significant downward shift in its weekly fatalities. With people confined to their homes, South Africa saw fewer reported deaths from common incidents such as traffic accidents. Epidemiologist Professor Debbie Bradshaw from the South African Medical Research Council notes: "Homicides almost halved with alcohol sales being banned. "But at the same time we think the other infectious diseases were probably affected as well; the more usual flu or severe pneumonias that come about in winter were also slowed down. As restrictions have eased, weekly deaths have begun to climb back to normal levels. more people dying than usual. South Korea confirmed its first coronavirus case on 20 January and its first death a full month later. The country's strategy of intensive testing and contact tracing is often credited with its low number of coronavirus deaths. The country was once reporting hundreds of new cases a day, with a large cluster identified in the city of Daegu linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Yet on 15 April, 29 million people nationwide participated in an election with no confirmed cases traced back to the poll. more people dying than usual. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit in the coronavirus pandemic and endured one of Europe's most restrictive lockdowns, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. The country hit its peak in the week ending 5 April, recording more than 11,000 excess deaths. The Spanish government had announced just below 6,000 official deaths from Covid-19 that week. The Madrid region has reported the highest levels of excess deaths, recording more than 2. 5 times the number of expected fatalities since the outbreak began. more people dying than usual. During Sweden's peak, in the week ending 12 April, the country recorded its highest number of deaths in a single week in over two decades. Swedish mortality figures contrast with neighbouring countries like Denmark and Norway, where total deaths have been much closer to levels seen in previous years. Throughout its outbreak, Sweden has avoided a full lockdown and kept large parts of society open. Instead, it has relied on voluntary social distancing and other targeted measures. Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of the country's Covid-19 response, acknowledged recently that the controversial decision not to impose a strict lockdown had led to too many deaths. However, he insisted that "we basically still think that is the right strategy for Sweden" and described the battle against the virus as a "marathon, not a sprint". more people dying than usual. The peak in Switzerland's mortality came during the week ending 5 April. Some 500 more people lost their lives than normal, an increase of 39%. Recent data suggests that the country's outbreak has been brought under control. For the five weeks leading up to 24 May, reported numbers of deaths in Switzerland have returned to the expected range. The number of official Covid-19 deaths in Switzerland is now greater than those excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus. more people dying than usual. Despite being the second country outside China to confirm a case of coronavirus, Thailand's official statistics have recorded a surprisingly low number of deaths from Covid-19. A sharp rise in confirmed cases in late March led Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to declare a state of emergency, yet the coronavirus death toll never surpassed four fatalities per day. In a similar pattern, all-cause mortality data have revealed a higher than average number of deaths in March that returned to normal levels in April and May. more people dying than usual. Note: Covid-19 deaths figures are for all of Turkey, not just Istanbul. As the virus spread quickly throughout Turkey in March, the government ordered harsh restrictions on movement to contain it. Istanbul's total number of reported deaths peaked in mid-April. Covid-19 mortality figures for the city are not available, yet even when taking the total number of coronavirus deaths for the entire country, they still do not account for all of Istanbul's excess deaths during the pandemic period. This means that the total number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid-19 in the city is likely to be much higher. more people dying than usual. The US has reported the world's largest death toll from coronavirus. But the way the outbreak has played out across the 50 states varies widely. New York City's coronvirus toll has been the most dramatic, with cases and deaths higher than those of many countries. Yet nationwide, all states have seen the impact of the virus on their healthcare systems and the lives of their citizens. While some states such as California acted quickly to restrict movement and try to contain the disease, others such as Wyoming have resisted strict lockdown measures. Many state-issued directives for citizens to stay at home are currently being eased. How is it being lifted? There is no definitive league table of the hardest hit, but we can still make broad comparisons between the countries through the first wave. Peru, Chile and Brazil are still dealing with growing numbers of deaths so the picture there will change rapidly over the coming weeks. The picture is more stable in countries where the total number of deaths has peaked and is now back to, or near to, normal. Among these countries, there's a group like the UK, Spain, Italy and Belgium who have seen deaths rise by more than 30%. That's very different to Japan or Germany, or many other countries whose weekly deaths have stayed within about 5% of normal. If we looked at the data slightly differently - counting deaths per head of population, or using the same number of weeks for every country - we'd get slightly different results. And the data itself is only provisional. So we can't produce a precise ranking of countries, but we can identify the unhappy club of hard hit countries whose membership, unfortunately, is only going to grow. How are excess deaths measured? To measure excess deaths, we have used mortality data showing deaths from all causes. These types of reports are often recorded and published by the central civil registry, health ministry or a country's statistical authority. They can take significant time to process and confirm, so all numbers of deaths recorded in recent months are preliminary and subject to revisions, and likely to include more deaths. The number of excess deaths represents the total number of deaths above the historical average. These figures have not been adjusted for age, so do not take into account demographic differences across country populations. The total number of excess deaths for each country have been rounded to the nearest hundred. How were countries chosen? We have focused on locations that have robust mortality data covering at least four weeks from the start of the coronavirus pandemic in that place. Where reliable data is not available at the national level, we have focused on a smaller region with complete data, such as Istanbul in Turkey. In Jakarta, Indonesia, records of burials within the city serve as a proxy for death counts. How was the outbreak defined in each area? The start of each location's outbreak is counted from the week or month during which it recorded its fifth official death from Covid-19. The period extends to the latest date for which there is available data that is unlikely to change significantly. In most cases, we have calculated our baseline of expected deaths from an average of reported fatalities for the area over five years, from 2015 to 2019. Where possible, we defer to a number of expected deaths that has been modelled by the statistical authority in that country in order to account for population changes or known environmental factors.
In the charts above the term "none overall" means either that all excess deaths in this particular location have been accounted for by the official coronavirus figures, or that there have been no excess deaths there. The figure for other excess deaths is calculated by taking the total number of excess deaths minus the sum of all Covid-19 deaths during the outbreak period in each place. What sources were used? Counts of official Covid-19 deaths are often sourced directly from the local government's own public reports. For sub-national areas like Jakarta, we have used Covid-19 deaths specific to that area. For Istanbul, the available Covid-19 data is only released at the national level. This causes an underestimation of the actual number of excess deaths that are not attributed to the coronavirus in Istanbul because the number attributed to Covid-19 represents the total for the whole of Turkey. Are there other ways to measure the virus' impact? Comparing excess deaths to expected deaths during a country's outbreak is one of several ways to measure impact. It is a useful way of assessing the raw death toll in a place, expressed either as a number of people beyond the expected level or as a percentage above average. But the duration of the outbreak plays a role in these calculations. For places that have a quick rise in deaths followed by a quick fall, like Spain, there will be fewer expected deaths during their outbreak period compared to places with an outbreak that lasted much longer, like the UK. The lower number of expected deaths for Spain makes its excess appear much higher in percentage terms. Another measure is to look at the excess deaths per million of population. The benefit is that it puts countries of differing populations on a more level playing field. However, measuring by deaths per million will look worse for a country with an older or less healthy population, since it doesn't account for the fact that an ageing country would expect to see more deaths.

			<data> Coronavirus: Is the pandemic getting worse in the US? The news in the US has been dominated by anti-racism protests in recent weeks, but coronavirus is now back in the headlines. Several states have seen a record number of cases this week, leading to fears that the country is experiencing a second wave of infections. of using "grim predictions" to scare the American people. So what is going on in the US? With about 2. 5 million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world - about a quarter of the global total. The situation got really bad in late March but by May, cases were declining and most states had begun to ease restrictions put into place to halt the spread of the virus. The number of new cases rarely fell below 20,000 though, because as some states were bringing their outbreaks under control, others were only just beginning to see flare-ups. For this reason, the top US health official for infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, sees the current situation as a continuation of the initial outbreaks. "We're still in a first wave. But it's important to note that the number of tests being carried out now is about double what it was in April and May so it's likely the true scale of that outbreak wasn't fully captured. The North East has been by far the worst-hit region, with about a quarter of all US cases and more than a third of all US deaths occurring in the states of New York and New Jersey. But in recent weeks, the region has brought its outbreaks under control. The South and West of the country, on the other hand, have seen a big rise in the number of infections. The Midwest is also starting to see an increase. There's no debate over whether cases are going up again, but there is over why. he thinks "testing is overrated" because "in many ways, it makes us look bad. The US has conducted more tests than any other country - about 30 million so far - so that does go some way to explaining why it has the highest number of cases in the world, although international comparisons are difficult to make for a number of reasons. But there's plenty of evidence to suggest the recent rise in infections is down to more than just a higher number of people being tested. Can you compare different countries? In recent days, Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have seen more new cases on their own than the entire nine-state North East region and that's not just down to increased testing. This is clear when you look at the rate of coronavirus tests that are coming back positive. If lots of tests are being done and the spread of the virus has been reduced, then the positive case rate would go down too. If the virus is still being spread widely, it goes up. The World Health Organization recommends that countries have a positive case rate at or below 5% for 14 days before they ease restrictions on movement. over the last month. One state that has seen an increase in cases since reopening is Texas, where bars have now been told to close their doors again by Governor Greg Abbott in a bid to slow the infection rate. An easing of restrictions has also been paused in Florida. Much of the recent surge in the South and the West has been driven by younger people "newly mobile after months of lockdowns," according to Robert Redfield, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He said many of these infections would have gone undiagnosed earlier on in the outbreak because fewer tests were being carried out. The CDC continues to advise the American public to maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and properly wear a facemask or covering. some people wear them primarily to show opposition to him. Coronavirus questions: Can I hug a friend? Amid all of the fears about new hotspots, the most positive news in the US at the moment is that daily deaths continue to fall. They peaked back in May when the outbreaks in the Northeast were at their most intense, with New York state alone registering around 1,000 a day. That figure has been below 50 in recent days. However, deaths is a metric that lags behind cases and hospitalisations because it can take several weeks for those who are worst-hit to die from the disease. That means the consequences of the current spikes in cases won't be seen for a couple of weeks at least. If we do see the number of deaths edging up, there will likely be some pressure on governors to reintroduce restrictions but Dr Fauci doesn't think that will happen. "I don't think we're going to be talking about going back to lockdown," he said last week. "I think we're going to be talking about trying to better control those areas of the country that seem to be having a surge of cases. Researchers are racing to produce a vaccine but it's clear that Americans, and the rest of the world, are going to be living with the virus until next year at the earliest. So far, the US has recorded about 125,000 coronavirus deaths - the highest death toll in the world. run by experts at the University of Washington, says the US is on course to hit 180,000 by October - a month before the election. The toll could be kept below 150,000 by that point, the experts said, if 95% of people started wearing facemasks or coverings in public. of more than 4,000 Americans carried out by the CDC in May found 74% of them always or often wore one while in public. What other countries are seeing coronavirus cases rise?</data>

			<data> Right at the moment when the prime minister is planning to turn the page to usher in a different political phase, the reinstatement of some restrictions on people's lives in Leicester is a reminder that the risk to our health from the coronavirus crisis is neither gone, nor forgotten. Ministers have been clear for some weeks that the possibility of 'local lockdowns' was very real. And the announcement from the health secretary on Monday evening was not just to put the brakes on easing of elements of the lockdown, he has also reversed some of changes that have already been made: closing non-essential shops again, and schools - aside from the children of key workers, or the vulnerable - restricted. It is not a small ask of the people of Leicester, a major city, to watch the rest of the country progress, while they have to go into reverse for now, to protect everyone's health. But this kind of on, and off, measure may become a regular feature of how the government tries to manage the infection as the months pass. There have been no secrets about the government's ambition to shake up how it does business. And there has never been any mystery about the desire of the prime minister's top adviser, Dominic Cummings to change Whitehall. What might perhaps have been rather abstract and hypothetical is becoming real. "He seems a nice fella. This morning, we watched the Labour leader perform what's known in the jargon as a walkabout. The lecterns emptied, the lights were turned off, the union flags left hanging behind the grand double doors of the Downing Street room that's staged nearly a hundred briefings in the last few torrid months. The prime minister's announcements about how England will take a big step out of lockdown came pretty much as billed. Unless something very strange happens in the next few hours, on Tuesday the prime minister will officially confirm the next step in the government's plan for taking the country out of lockdown. When the government outlined its strategy, July 4th was already named as the day when businesses in England who still had their doors closed would be able to start opening up again - hairdressers, pubs, hospitality and tourism - businesses that saw their livelihoods drain away while the nation stayed at home. Most of us change our minds all the time. Maybe this morning you had planned to go for a run, then actually when push came to shove another ten minutes in bed seemed a better idea. A classic of the genre. After the talks between political leaders today, a rash of metaphors or mottoes unsurprisingly emerges, rather than any solid confessions of what was really discussed. This is a very tricky moment for the prime minister. One minister admitted the government was in a "rough patch - everyone's a bit angry having been locked up for too long". "I'm so angry and disappointed. Our kids are going to suffer for years. These are the words of one parent on hearing the news that the government had given up on its plan to get all children back to primary school in England before the end of the school term. "Move on" - that's the overwhelming message from No 10 about the behaviour of the prime minister's most valued adviser.</data>

			<data> The authors of Dr Nerdlove, Savage Love, Sense and Sensitivity, The Moneyist, Ask a Manager and ¡Hola Papi! The coronavirus outbreak has changed the way we all live and work - and, as a result, it's given us a whole new, unprecedented, set of problems. What if you can't stand your partner, now that you're in lockdown together and can no longer ignore their annoying traits? Or worse - what if you broke up just before the order to stay at home, and are now awkwardly stuck under the same roof? If you're lucky enough to work from home, how do you deal with difficult children - or a boss who likes to micromanage you remotely? What if you still have to go in to work - and your boss won't let you wear a mask? What if your parents are driving you crazy? Or what if you just feel really lonely? For decades, advice columnists - or "agony aunts" - have been the go-to place for people wanting to ask for advice anonymously. Now, the crisis means some columnists are getting more queries - and the questions have become more serious and urgent. "The outbreak has dramatically changed the type of mail I'm getting," says Alison Green, who runs the popular Ask A Manager advice column. "About 90% of them are now related to the outbreak. Harriette Cole, who writes the syndicated column Sense and Sensitivity, says "there is no relationship today that isn't somehow affected". with your child, after they realise all their friends have gone to second homes. Frankly, this is a time when we could all use some advice and support - so we spoke to some of the US's favourite agony aunts and uncles, to find out what problems are bothering their readers the most - and what advice they have. 'What if my workplace isn't safe? Ms Green says that, prior to the outbreak, most of her reader questions were about awkward interactions. "There was a lot of inter-personal stuff - like 'my co-worker is really annoying', or 'I'm allergic to my boss' perfume'. I have almost none of those questions now - because that stuff goes away if you're not physically at work with people, and people's priorities are different now. It's a similar situation for Quentin Fottrell, who runs The Moneyist, an advice column on the finance media site Marketwatch. "Service workers in essential industries are really at the coal face," Mr Fottrell says. "People are just grappling with bosses who don't understand the pandemic. How safe is takeaway food and grocery shopping? So what should you do if your workplace is unsafe? "It's really hard, but if your employer is making decisions that jeopardise your health, you can try to push back as a group, because there's safety in numbers," says Ms Green. "Depending on the situation, it might also be something you can report to the state authorities. 'Should I pay my cleaner even if they're not working? due to social distancing - but wondered if they should keep paying them. That paying would be a "decent gesture" if they could afford it. Since service staff have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak, he also suggests people tip 5% more than usual. "I feel like it's the lower paid workers who are really taking the brunt of this virus through their workplaces - when I go to the supermarket, I always say 'thank you for working today'. 'How do I handle working from home? while also looking after children. "Managers are suddenly managing everyone remotely - and some don't know how to - so they micromanage, or want multiple check-ins every day. I've heard from people whose managers wanted them to stay on video all day long" to prove they're working, Ms Green says. For people with anxious bosses, Ms Green suggests that you offer to send them information at the start of each day about what you're working on, and try to explain that having several check-in meetings daily could actually make you less productive. Zoom is in everyone's living room - how safe is it? Meanwhile, she tells managers that it's in their own interests to be supportive right now - and understanding of employees who may be less productive than usual. "People have long memories. .. If they see you making life harder for your employees - they may not leave right away, but they will eventually. 'How do I date during the outbreak? Relationship advice columnists have also seen a drastic change. Harris O'Malley runs the Dr Nerdlove column - which he describes as giving "dating advice to geeks of all stripes". Previously, many questions were from readers who felt they were unattractive or socially awkward. Thanks to social distancing, these questions have fallen away - partly, he believes, because "a lot of my audience feel more secure communicating over text or internet than in person". Instead, the outbreak has "changed the mechanics" of dating - and he now has to coach people on how to have good online dates. "I'm having to tell people about how to connect on a more mental or emotional level - how to keep relationships vibrant when you can't fall back on the easy outs. "When you're not able to meet up in person, you can't say 'let's have this casual relationship and see if it goes anywhere' - people are now finding they have to approach relationships with thought, care and attention. 'What if I can't meet my sex partner anymore? Dan Savage, who runs the popular Savage Love column and podcast, says over 80% of the queries he gets are now coronavirus-related - and the outbreak has forced him to change his advice as "the very premise of many sex and dating questions has been exploded" by the outbreak. Previously, he often advocated for non-monogamous and open relationships. with partners they live with to observe social distancing. He also gets questions about "sexting". How do I protect myself? 'What if I can't stand my partner anymore? Beyond online sex, Dan Savage says many readers "find being forced to spend every moment with their partner is exposing cracks in their relationship". It's important that couples "carve out time alone" even when they are under the same roof, he says. "We interpret someone wanting 'alone time' as rejection, but studies show one predictor of long-term success in a couple is the ability to spend time apart. How dating and love continue for three couples during the coronavirus lockdown. , right before the lockdown. In those cases, he has suggested that readers stay put where possible, and "acknowledge the awkwardness". In the case of the woman who wanted to leave her husband, he suggested signalling some flexibility for now - even if her mind's made up - to make her temporary living situation more bearable for them both. 'What if I'm single and feel lonely? and feel particularly lonely right now. Mr O'Malley says clients "who are lonely and want to date" have asked him whether they can flirt with people they see in public places. "I've had to tell them: no, you really can't - it's kind of irresponsible to do so right now. - from teenagers who like each other and have started communicating on Snapchat, but are unable to hang out at school and get to know each other. "Normally by now they would be [meeting] each other. Now all they have is social media," she says. To try doing things the old-school way, by "literally talking on the phone", because "engaging in lengthier conversations will help you to get to know each other better". Mr Savage urges single readers not to assume that couples are happier. "Happiness is something we create for ourselves. We all need to build lives that are rich, as individuals, because there will be times in all our lives when we're un-partnered. Work on getting happy now - you can work on getting partnered later. 'What if I'm stuck with my parents? John Paul Brammer writes the ¡Hola Papi! column, which advises on LGBT issues - particularly for the Latino community. He says he has seen a dramatic jump in the number of reader queries - and is "getting a lot of letters from people who've found they've had to re-closet themselves" during the pandemic. Some of his readers are out to their friends but not their parents, while others may be out, but still "feel more comfortable expressing their full selves outside their homes". "Now that a lot of people find themselves at home with their parents 24/7, a lot of anxiety returns - they feel re-closeted or like they're losing who they are. His advice is to remember that "this is temporary, and you're still you", and to try and communicate your feelings with a supportive family member or friends. He also urges people to reach out to others - "everyone wants to be connected right now… pain is what bonds people together". 'How do I mentally get through this outbreak? These may be unprecedented times - but coronavirus isn't the first crisis the world has faced. Ms Green started the Ask a Manager column in 2007 - shortly before the recession hit - and remembers that "for years, my mail was very depressing". Similarly, Mr Savage began his column in 1991, and says his early column was dominated by questions from readers anxious about the HIV/Aids crisis. He emphasises that things won't always be like this. "It's terrifying, I'm scared, but we will come through this… The crisis is highlighting a lot of social injustices, and hopefully that will stiffen our resolve to do something about it after the crisis ends. Meanwhile, Mr Fottrell says "one of the most valuable functions of an advice column is it shows people who haven't written in" that others are experiencing similar problems. "You are not alone. We always think our situations are unique - and while we are unique as people, if you're experiencing something, you can be sure many others are too. from following the crisis. Agony aunts as well as their readers welcome having the chance to address something different, columnists told BBC. Mr O'Malley recalls a recent question submitted to the Dr Nerdlove column, where a reader was "worried about the size and appearance of his genitalia". "I never thought I'd say this - but I really appreciated a question that wasn't about Covid-19!</data>

			<data> Coronavirus: What are the numbers out of Latin America? Coronavirus cases have been rising sharply in Latin American countries, contributing to record numbers of new infections being recorded globally. Brazil has had more than one million confirmed cases - the second highest in the world after the US. Other countries in the region, including Mexico, Chile and Peru, are also battling major outbreaks. So what are the main trends in Latin America? there are indications that there were cases there as early as January. Coronavirus has since spread to every country in the region. This is fewer cases and deaths than in Europe and the US, but testing is nowhere near as widespread and deaths may be under-reported. Latin America's two most populous nations, Brazil and Mexico, have seen the highest number of deaths, more than 54,000 and 25,000 respectively. Peru has the sixth highest number of reported cases in the world, and more than 8,500 confirmed deaths. And researchers say these countries could be significantly under-reporting deaths, with many cases going undiagnosed. Chile is reporting thousands of new coronavirus cases each day, with more than 4,900 people dead. Ecuador recorded one of the earliest and worst outbreaks in the region, although cases here are now stabilising - but this is not the trend in many other countries. Unlike in the US and most countries in Europe, many countries in Latin America are seeing their daily cases and deaths increase. Looking at Brazil, Mexico and Peru compared with three of the worst-hit countries in Europe in terms of deaths - the UK, Italy and France - you can see daily deaths remain high in these Latin American nations as they drop elsewhere. Peru's daily reported deaths appear to be levelling off - but it has recorded the most deaths per capita in the region, with 27 per 100,000 people. The head of the Pan American Health Organization, Dr Carissa Etienne has warned that coronavirus is spreading "exponentially" in many areas of the region. The number of deaths in Brazil, Mexico and Peru is doubling roughly every three weeks. has warned that Brazil's death toll could climb to 125,000 by early August. Dr Etienne has said "there can be no doubt our region has become the epicentre" of the pandemic. Latin America now consistently reports more daily cases than the US and Europe. Experts say the peak of the epidemic in some Latin American countries is still some weeks away. As daily cases continue to rise, there are concerns that healthcare systems could be overwhelmed, as has already been the case in Ecuador. Pilar Mazzetti, who is leading the Peruvian government's coronavirus response, has said: "We're in bad shape. This is war. What is being done to stop the spread? Mexico and Brazil have continued to take less severe lockdown measures than other Latin American countries. Both have given out guidelines, but have not imposed national restrictions. has been ordered by a judge to wear a mask in public in the capital Brasilia, or face a fine. Marcia Castro, a global health professor at Harvard University, says that "the response in Brazil is far from ideal, and currently there is a lack of a uniform message coming from the leadership at different levels. Other countries such as Argentina have imposed compulsory lockdowns. Prof Castro says it is, along with Uruguay, among the countries in the region for now able to manage the spread. Peru had one of the first and strictest national lockdowns in the region, but continues to see cases and deaths rise. It has extended its lockdown until the end of June. As cases rapidly rise in Chile, the government has tightened lockdowns across the country. Chile has one of Latin America's highest rates of testing - around 53 tests per 1,000 people. But testing across the region is significantly below other parts of the world. Mexico has carried out around 3 tests per 1,000 people, compared with around 86 per 1,000 in the US. estimates the number of infections could be up to 15 times higher than the official figure.

			<data> For millions of Indians, Jasleen Bhalla's is a familiar voice. When you dial a phone number in India you don't always hear a ringing as you wait for the other person to answer, but sometimes a piece of music or a message, known locally as a "caller tune". And for the past two-and-a-half months, her warm and soothing tones are the first thing people hear when they make a telephone call. The voiceover artist, with her message instructing Indians how to behave during the pandemic, has come to be known as India's "corona voice". A voice actor for a decade, she is also the voice of a private airline, one of India's biggest telecom companies and the Delhi Metro's airport service - it's her voice that tells you what the next station is and whether the doors will open on the right or the left. But, it's the coronavirus campaign that has brought her into the limelight. In the past week, since it became known that the Covid-19 awareness message is spoken by her, Ms Bhalla has become a celebrity of sorts. The Indian press has picked up her story, on social media her voice has been described as "superb" and "spiffing", and memes and TikTok videos have been made around her audio clip. "I was just doing my job [until a week ago] and no-one knew me and then one TV interview went viral and my life's changed," she told the BBC. Like so many voice artists, Ms Bhalla was not known "because a face is not associated with the voice". But the pandemic, she says, is "making me stand out because the nation is unified in fear, and they are also unified in the knowledge that here's this voice I hear every day and so does everyone else". "I'm obviously loving the popularity, the attention," she says, "but then who wants the tag of corona voice? It began with a call she received from a studio in early March saying there was a message from India's health ministry that needed to be recorded urgently. "My producer said it had to be 30 seconds, you have to sound warm and friendly, but also concerned and responsible and, at the same time, instructive," she told me over the phone from her home in Delhi. It was the early days of the pandemic in India and not everyone knew the protocols they had to follow to stay safe. The message she was asked to record began with "Namaskar! Coronavirus ya Covid-19 se aaj poora desh lad raha hai… [Greetings! The entire country is fighting against coronavirus…]". It went on to advise people to "stay home, stay safe" - not to leave home unless absolutely necessary, wear a face mask when going out, wash hands frequently with soap and maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Is social distancing an oxymoron in India? "I was asked to record it in English and Hindi. I did four or five takes of each, sent it over and forgot about it," she says, "until a couple of days later when my family and friends started telling me: do you know you're everywhere when we call? Ms Bhalla says when she recorded the campaign, she had no idea where it was going to be used or that it would have such a wide reach. But telecom firms, instructed by the government to replace caller tunes with the public health message, played and replayed the 30-second audio clip, making Ms Bhalla's voice among the most recognised in India today. In the past few weeks, she has recorded two more updates as the situation has evolved and the guidelines changed. "The second message was recorded when doctors and nurses and other frontline staff were being shunned by people and I was asked to remind them that 'we are fighting the ailment, not the ailing'. "It was very emotional, I had goosebumps as I read out those lines. They were beautiful and conveyed my emotion too," she says. The third message was recorded when social distancing rules changed and people had to be told to maintain a distance of two metres and not one, as earlier instructed. Some people, though, have complained that they find the message "irritating" because they are being made to hear it repeatedly. Ms Bhalla says she understands that some people find the message too repetitive and might want to give it a miss - after all, she also has to listen to it when she makes a call. "I know it's going to go on for 30 seconds, and it's my voice telling me to wash your hands and wear your mask and use your hand sanitiser," she says. "But we are in a grave situation, aren't we? "For caution to become the new normal for all of us, I think this bitter-sweet pill is much needed. It's a logical and effective tool to spread the message far and wide. What are they and how to guard against them? When should you wear one? WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE BODY?</data>

			<data> Coronavirus could spread faster, wider and with deadlier consequences in Yemen than many other countries in the world, the UN says. Here's five reasons why. Since 2015, Yemen has been devastated by conflict, leaving millions of people without access to proper health care, clean water or sanitation - crucial for preventing the virus from spreading. Vital food, medical and humanitarian supplies have been restricted by a partial land, sea and air blockade put in place by a Saudi-led coalition of countries fighting Houthi rebels - while the rebels themselves have obstructed the distribution of aid. Not having a central government in charge (rebels drove the government out of the capital and into the south of the country) makes coronavirus harder to contain. Conditions in Yemen put the population at particular risk to a highly contagious disease. Almost three years before the advent of Covid-19, the UN declared Yemen the most needy place on Earth. Some 24 million people there - that's about 80% of the population - depend on aid to survive, and millions are on the brink of starvation. An estimated 2 million children are acutely malnourished, and the country was already struggling to cope with diseases such as dengue fever, malaria and cholera before the first cases of coronavirus were reported. Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? Weakened immune systems mean those suffering from chronic illnesses could contract Covid-19 more easily, and find it harder to survive. Five years of war has shattered the country's health system, leaving it incapable of coping with a pandemic. Many of Yemen's 3,500 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed in air strikes, and only half are thought to be fully functioning. Clinics are reported to be crowded, and basic medicines and equipment are lacking - in a country of 27. 5 million people there are only a few hundred ventilator machines, which are used to help patients breathe in cases where coronavirus leads to lung failure. Without knowing more accurately who has got coronavirus, it is more difficult to prevent its spread or plan for numbers of patients putting additional strain on the already fragile health system. Since the first coronavirus patient was reported in government-held areas in April, the true scale of the outbreak has been impossible to determine. , while rebels who control the capital and other densely populated areas say they have detected only four cases in their territory. The UN says that with testing kits in short supply and a lack of transparency in data from the rebels and the government, the actual number of cases are almost certainly much higher across the board. Alongside a lack of medicine to treat cases, medics in Yemen lack personal protection equipment (PPE), such as masks and gowns, to shield them from the disease. An unconfirmed report on privately owned Al-Masdar news website said dozens of medics had died as a result of Covid-19 in both rebel- and government-held areas. earlier this month, in what was described as a major blow to Yemen's health sector.</data>

			<data> Two days after the US recorded its first case of coronavirus, Donald Trump said the situation was "totally under control" and assured the public it was "going to be just fine". Fast forward four months and the virus has spread across all 50 states, leaving a death toll of 100,000 from more than 1. 6 million confirmed cases. We've taken a look at how those figures compare to other countries around the world and how the situation could develop over the next few months. How does the situation in the US compare? The death toll in the US became the highest in the world in early April and has risen dramatically since then. President Donald Trump initially said "50 to 60,000" people could die during the outbreak but in May he said he was hopeful the toll would be lower than 100,000. That benchmark has now been hit though and there are still about 1,000 deaths a day on average. - that is the number of people that have died relative to the country's population - as evidence that the US has dealt with the virus more effectively than some other nations. The chart below shows the countries with the highest death tolls and, to the right, their mortality rate. You can see that by that measure there are several countries where a greater proportion of the population has died during the coronavirus outbreak. Belgium, with a population of 11. 5 million, has seen 82 people in every 100,000 die during its coronavirus outbreak while the US, with a population of around 330 million, has seen nearly 30 people in every 100,000 die. But if you look at New York - the worst-hit state in the US - the mortality rate there is close to 150 people in every 100,000, which shows that there is a lot of variation across the US. One of the problems with comparing countries is that many of them report deaths in different ways. Belgium, for instance, includes deaths where coronavirus was suspected of being present but was never confirmed with a test. Some US states record deaths this way, but not all. There have also been questions over whether official data from some countries can be trusted. Another issue is that countries could be at different stages of an outbreak. In many European countries it's clear that daily cases numbers are coming down significantly and they are past the peak. But you can't say the same for the US at the moment. Why are international comparisons difficult? New York over the worst, but is the US? Several countries in Europe had outbreaks around the same time as the US and all of them have seen the number of deaths grow quickly, peak and then fall away. The US has not. One of the reasons the number of daily deaths in the US has plateaued rather than fallen is the sheer size of the country - rather than one large outbreak, there have been multiple centres of infection that developed at different times and spread at different rates. In New York, the virus struck early, spread quickly and peaked in early April. In the rest of the US, however, the number of daily deaths has been slow to fall. Some other states that were badly affected early on, like Louisiana and Michigan, have also seen a substantial drop in the number of daily deaths like that in New York. But as the situation in those states has improved, others have worsened. How exposed is your job? How long does it take to get better? In recent weeks, President Trump has been keen to talk about the number of tests being done in the US. says the US has carried out about 15 million so far. That figure puts the US way ahead of other countries, but when it comes to using testing to try to control the virus, there is more to it than the total number you've conducted. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, have been most successful in slowing the spread. In South Korea, for example, they ramped up testing early on in the outbreak and managed to contain the virus. Less than 300 people have died with coronavirus in the country, which has a population of about 50 million. But as the chart above shows, it wasn't until several weeks after the first death in the US that officials really stepped up testing. that the testing system was "currently failing" and that the US was not able to supply tests "easily, the way people in other countries are doing it". The number of daily tests shows the US is well past those initial problems, but progress can still be made. If the 15m figure is accurate, that would still only be 4. 5% of the population. So what happens next in the US? in the past. One of the issues with making projections is that no one is quite sure what effect the gradual reopening of the US economy will have on the spread of the virus. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but the majority of states have now begun to loosen their stay-at-home restrictions. for states to meet before they begin reopening, including seeing a downward trajectory of case numbers for two weeks. say only a couple of states are hitting the targets. Dr Fauci has warned states that they will see "little spikes that might turn into outbreaks" if they reopen before getting the virus under control. But his advice has contradicted that of President Trump, who is keen to get the US economy restarted ahead of his re-election campaign. show that nearly a quarter of the American workforce have lost their jobs since the outbreak began. Asked earlier this month whether lives would be lost to reopen the country, Mr Trump said: "Will some people be affected badly? But we have to get our country opened and we have to get it open soon. Even if states continue to ease restrictions, it's unclear whether the American public will be eager to return to shops and restaurants just yet. by the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Americans were concerned that states would reopen too quickly. Are states reopening ahead of White House guidelines?</data>

			<data> Researching viruses in farm animals is essential rather than glamorous work, and The Pirbright Institute in Surrey excels at it. But recently they've been getting some very unwanted attention. For months they've been unwittingly drawn into the orbit of conspiracy theorists, including those who accuse Bill Gates of planning the coronavirus pandemic. It's led to hate mail and threatening phone calls. "We'd never experienced anything quite like that. Some of the commentary was quite vicious. Calling us murderers, that type of thing", says Teresa Maughan, head of communications. Teresa remembers one particular phone call. The person had rung up before, leaving a colleague in tears after shouting down the phone accusing them of creating coronavirus and using it as a bioweapon. "He then called me pretending to be Mrs Doubtfire, so it was pretty obvious it was somebody putting on a voice. He said something sexually abusive to me and I obviously put the phone down. It all started in January with misleading social media posts about a patent. in the United States, posted a series of tweets linking The Pirbright Institute to a patent "for the coronavirus" granted in 2018. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause a range of illnesses in both animals and humans. The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 only emerged at the end of 2019, so the suggestion being made was that the institute had identified this virus much earlier and lodged a "patent" for it. The institute does hold a patent, but it's linked to research into a vaccine for a previously known coronavirus that affects chickens. Mr Sather also wrote that Bill and Melinda Gates were major funders of this Pirbright project, later speculating: "Was the release of this disease planned? The connection to Bill Gates has drawn the institute into a much bigger global conspiracy theory - tapping into the unfounded notion that sinister forces led by Mr Gates have orchestrated the whole pandemic to eventually make huge profits from a Covid-19 vaccine. The Gates Foundation is one of the world's largest supporters of global health projects, and The Pirbright is quite open about its funding from there for research linked to vaccines. However, that funding isn't related to any work for which a patent has been taken out. At the end of March, long after the attacks began on social media, The Pirbright started working with Oxford University and Public Health England to test a potential Covid-19 vaccine on pigs, a necessary stage before a vaccine can be tested on humans. We tried to contact Mr Sather about his comments but have been unable to get a response. In a later tweet he says he didn't claim The Pirbright patent was specifically for the "novel coronavirus" (the virus which causes Covid-19). A search for The Pirbright Institute on CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool, returned 191,000 results between 16 January 2020 and 16 June. There were just 711 in the previous six months. All manner of false accusations were levelled at them: that they had a patent for the virus or a vaccine for it; that they were actually based in Wuhan; that they were owned by Bill Gates. Online abuse was hurled at staff. "You know the composition of this Virus so you know how to destroy it. ..SO PLEASE I REQUEST YOU NOT LET MY FAMILY DIE AND TELL ME THE ANTIDOTE. "Personally I found the misinformation spreading quite difficult", says Dr Bickerton,"because the work we're trying to do is to help livestock and other animals and understand this virus. Someone even went to the trouble of setting up a fake "Pirbright" website offering to sell a coronavirus bioweapon. "When conspiracy theories start, people don't realise there are humans on the end of social media accounts," says Teresa Maughan. The four-person communications team was simply not used to dealing with this volume of material on social media. They contacted the police over the most threatening posts and phone calls, as well as reporting content to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In evidence submitted to the parliamentary committee for digital, media culture and sport looking into Covid-19 disinformation in April, the institute expressed frustration at the lack of action following their complaints. Facebook told BBC News that posts which repeated false claims about the Pirbright, either that it had invented the coronavirus or that it held a patent for a vaccine, didn't meet their bar for deletion. Some of these posts have been marked "false" by fact-checking organisations. There was more trouble ahead. In May, a video watched by over a million people in just one day repeated the claims about Pirbright and a Covid-19 vaccine patent. Several versions of this video have since been taken down, including two that BBC News flagged to YouTube this week. YouTube told us: "We have clear policies around promoting misinformation on YouTube, and updated our policies to ensure that content on the platform aligns with WHO guidance. On Twitter, transcripts of the video have also been widely shared. A spokesperson for Twitter told us it didn't act on every tweet that contained disputed information about Covid-19, and instead prioritised posts with "a call to action that could potentially cause harm". It's been a difficult time for staff at The Pirbright Institute, but they're hoping the worst is now over. The abuse has died down. There are no more angry phone calls. After such an ordeal, Dr Bickerton says she's more confident to promote and explain her research and make sure accurate information gets out there. "It's great to be able to get involved in this research and see if we can learn more about the novel coronavirus. This will be really important when developing effective vaccines.</data>

			<data> As coronavirus cases spread through African countries, misleading information continues to be shared on social media and online. Here are some of the stories that have been widely shared recently. We start with a baseless conspiracy revolving around Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina, and the unproven herbal tonic, Covid-Organics, which he's promoting to treat coronavirus. Social media posts have been circulating that claim he's being offered large amounts of money by the World Health Organization (WHO) to secretly poison the drink. The baseless theory suggests that the WHO wants to prove that African countries can't be self-reliant and find their own cure for Covid-19. It appears to have first appeared in a French-language post on a Facebook account that was operating from Angola and DR Congo on 23 April. The claims were later published by two newspapers in Tanzania on 14 May. One of these reports alleges President Rajoelina had admitted - during an interview with France24 - that he'd been offered money. The story has been picked up and widely shared on social media across Africa. Mr Rajoelina was indeed interviewed by France24 on 11 May, but at no point does he say he'd been offered any money by the WHO. The WHO has told the BBC the story is fake, and the Madagascar government has dismissed the allegations. "Since the launch of the Covid-Organics remedy, many words have been falsely attributed to President Andry Rajoelina", government spokesperson Lova Ranoramoro has said. The herbal drink Covid-Organics continues to be produced in Madagascar and has been exported for use in other African countries, but there's no evidence it works against the virus. but has also warned against untested treatments. An online article claiming Tanzania's Health Minister, Ummy Mwalimu, had tested positive for coronavirus, was shared on Twitter by, among others, a prominent
journalist. But this story is not true. The basis of the story was a screenshot of a tweet, which the author claimed was posted by the minister. The translation for the Swahili-language tweet reads: "It is unfortunate that I have tested positive for coronavirus. But I'll continue to serve my nation remotely as if I was on the frontline until things get better". But the tweet doesn't appear in the minister's Twitter feed. The minister and the ministry of health have both dismissed the report as fake. South Sudan President Salva Kiir and other senior officials have used so-called "protective" badges that claim to repel viruses, but which don't work. Photos posted on Facebook by the president's press unit show him and other officials wearing what look very similar to two kinds of badges that can be bought online - called "Air Doctor" and "Virus Shut Out ". But there's no evidence that these can ward off viruses and bacteria. When contacted by the BBC, a South Sudan government spokesperson said they'd been supplied to them by someone who said they were working on behalf of the Japanese government. But they added they'd stopped wearing them "as they are not approved by the WHO". The Japanese Embassy in South Sudan has denied any link to them. and have been spotted being used by members of the Russian parliament. the subject of a warning from the US drug regulator, the FDA. Misleading messages have been spreading on social media claiming that Tanzania's President John Magufuli has banned the wearing of masks in public. These posts claim the president had said wearing masks would spread fear, and send the wrong message to foreign visitors once international travel and tourism resume. They use a screenshot of a tweet purportedly posted by the president, but it is fake. However, when we checked, we found that President Magufuli was in the city of Dodoma at that time. The president's spokesperson has called on people to disregard the claim. The Tanzanian government encourages citizens to wear masks in public, and to practice social distancing. there are concerns that the president is downplaying the impact of the virus. What can I do? What are the symptoms?</data>

			<data> has announced a “corona test offensive” that would allow citizens to get a test for the virus even if they don’t show any symptoms. “All Bavarian citizens will be promptly offered the opportunity to have themselves tested by an established contract physician, even without symptoms,” Bavaria’s health minister Melanie Huml said following the announcement on Sunday. Testing costs that aren’t currently covered by public health insurance schemes could in the future be shouldered by the state, the minister said. Currently public health insurers tend to pay for the laboratory cost of analysing blood samples, but usually don’t cover the cost of having the sample taken. Such a “universal” testing programme would make it easier to detect and contain local outbreaks or asymptomatic carriers of the virus, politicians in the southern German state argue. But the plan has been met with scepticism from Germany’s federal health minister, who questioned whether the scheme could be expanded across the country as a whole: “Extensive testing makes sense, especially to contain regional outbreaks”, said Jens Spahn, of the conservative Christian Democratic Union. “But a test is always just a snapshot. It must not give a false sense of security”. does not look much like a polling booth. Makeshift polling stations popped up throughout the country last Thursday, when Russians started voting outdoors, online and in municipal buildings to green-light the changes proposed by Putin earlier this year. People can vote as they’re passing by and it also minimises the risk of coronavirus infections,” says a local election official, Ekaterina Vesselkova, as she waits for voters in a district of Saint Petersburg. A blue cardboard screen occasionally swept away by gusts of wind is on hand to ensure privacy for the slow trickle of around 50 people per day who stop at the table to vote. In the city centre, another improvised polling booth was not equipped with the paper partition, but voters can vote “behind the ballot box,” an official says. “We had a screen, but the wind kept blowing it over,” says Yury Chursov, an administrator who urged passers-by to come and vote. He says the outdoor placement of the booth isn’t to protect voters from being infected with coronavirus, but to make it as easy for large numbers to participate. An election commission member registers a woman for voting in the city of Ulan Ude. Putin insisted that Russians vote on the reforms that were hastily approved by parliament, even though it is not legally required, arguing a plebiscite would give the amendments legitimacy. “It seems clear that this new method of voting is being used to increase participation in places where voters live,” says Vitaly Averin, a regional coordinator with independent monitoring group Golos. As well as resetting Putin’s term limits, the reforms would consolidate presidential powers by allowing him to nominate top judges and prosecutors for approval by the upper house of parliament. The reforms include economic benefits that guarantee the minimum wage will be no less than the minimum subsistence level and that state pensions will be adjusted annually to inflation. They also include a mention of Russians’ “faith in God” and the effective banning of gay marriage. Videos of the makeshift polling places have sparked ridicule and criticism on social media after images circulated showing ballot boxes on public benches, in the boot of a car, in the wilderness and in a bus. The Kremlin’s most vocal opponent Alexei Navalny, who has said the results of the vote are sure to be falsified, lashed out at the improvised polling places. “I refuse to accept that the fundamental law of my country can be adopted by ‘voting’ in the trunks of cars and tents and on tree stumps,” he wrote on Twitter on Monday. , requesting a limitation in vehicles operating in the city due to a decrease in demand brought about by Covid-19. has ordered a probe into alleged corruption surrounding Covid-19 funds, while the number of confirmed deaths from the virus has risen by 12 to a total of 745. It was also revealed that the Taliban have carried out at least 44 attacks each day since February. President Ashraf Ghani warned officials that any corruption and negligence in the handling of the outbreak response budget will be dealt with accordingly, and ordered an investigation. “The presidential palace inspector should assess all accusations and allegations of corruption in the coronavirus response budget spending and inform the people about the details of the expenses,” the presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The health ministry detected 279 new Covid-19 infections from 769 tests on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 31,517. The war-torn country, which has admitted it has a lack of testing capacity, has tested 72,318 suspected patients since the outbreak began. The number of recoveries stands at 14,036. The health ministry spokesman, Akmal Samsour, said Monday that the actual number of infections is higher than what the ministry has reported, as “only patients with severe symptoms go to medical centres, so the actual number may be something between 150,000 and 1. Most new cases were confirmed in the central province of Ghor, after 65 tests from 95 came back positive. Ghor recorded its second death from Covid-19 overnight. The capital, Kabul, which has been the country’s worst affected area, reported 41 new cases and three deaths. Meanwhile, the Taliban has carried out at least 44 daily attacks since February, according to the country’s national security council. “On average, the Taliban has carried out 44 attacks and killed or wounded 24 civilians every day in Afghanistan since the 22 February reduction in violence week,” said Javid Faisal, the council’s spokesman. “The success of the Doha deal and peace in Afghanistan requires an immediate reduction in violence and the start of direct talks. At least 23 civilians were killed in Helmand and dozens were wounded when mortars hit a cattle market on Monday. Twenty-one patients have lost their lives to Covid-19 since the outbreak began in Helmand. The warring sides blamed each other for the attack on the open-air weekly cattle market in Sangin district, where hundreds of villagers from neighbouring districts had gathered to trade sheep and goats. The district is mostly under Taliban control. At least six civilians, including women and children, were killed in the province on Sunday afternoon when their vehicle was hit by a roadside mine. Two civilians also were killed this morning when their vehicle was hit by such a mine. Save the Children condemned the deaths of children in Helmand and asked for the war on children to stop. Milan Dinic, country director for Save the Children in Afghanistan said in a statement: “These past few months have been some of the deadliest in recent times, with a spike in the numbers of attacks that involved civilians. At a time in which the country should be focusing on the Covid-19 outbreak and the devastating effects it has on millions, the extreme violence hampers the possibility for people to get support and children to have access to education and other services. until the end of July in a bid to avoid the risk of a second wave of the coronavirus as the country was poised to reopen bars and allow some foreigners into the country. The cabinet approved the extension of the emergency decree because the global pandemic was still ongoing, Narumon Pinyosinwat, a spokeswoman for the Thai government told a briefing. With the government set to ease more restrictions on Wednesday, it was necessary for the government to continue using the decree to control travel and reduce the risk of a second wave, she said. The emergency decree gives the government a range of additional powers including to deploy officials to investigate venues, bring in curfews, restrict gatherings and control travel, Reuters reports. , for those affected. Some suburbs of Melbourne have returned to “stage three” today. Australia's Covid-19 restrictions and coronavirus lockdown rules explained: how far can I travel, and can I have people over? Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most Covid-19 cases and deaths? The United States is not on a “safe list” of destinations for non-essential travel due to be unveiled by European Union governments later today, three diplomats have said. The 27-member bloc is expected to give outline approval to leisure or business travel from Wednesday to 14 countries beyond its borders when they vote on the list by midday Brussels time, the diplomats said. The countries are said to be Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. Meanwhile Russia and Brazil, along with the United States, are among countries that do not make the initial “safe list”, Reuters reports. The vote is aimed at supporting the EU travel industry and tourist destinations, particularly countries in southern Europe hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. China would also be provisionally approved, although travel would only open up if Chinese authorities also allowed in EU visitors. Reciprocity is a condition of being on the safe list. The list must be passed by a “qualified majority” of EU countries, meaning 15 EU countries representing 65% of the population. Four EU diplomats said they expected it to secure the required backing. It will act as a recommendation to EU members, meaning they will almost certainly not allow access to travellers from other countries, but could potentially set restrictions on those entering from the 14 nations. The EU’s efforts to reopen internal borders – particularly among the 26-nation Schengen area, which normally has no frontier checks – have been patchy as various countries have restricted access for certain visitors. Greece is mandating Covid-19 tests for arrivals from a range of EU countries, including France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, with self-isolation until results are known. The Czech Republic is not allowing in tourists from Portugal and Sweden. British residents can also travel to many EU countries, although non-essential travellers to Britain are required to self-isolate for 14 days. in some parts of the country, including the capital Tashkent, as it seeks to curb a fresh rise in Covid-19 infections following the gradual lifting of a two-month lockdown. The central Asian nation had been cautiously lifting a nationwide lockdown that had been in place in April and May, Reuters reports. However, after a decline in Covid-19 cases between mid-April and mid-May, it has once again seen a steady rise. The new restrictions will see residents of “red” and “yellow” areas deemed at higher risk barred from leaving their homes between 11pm and 7am, except for medical emergencies, the government said today. Large shopping malls and markets will also be closed on weekends across the country. Uzbekistan has divided its territory into green, yellow and red zones depending on the rate of fresh Covid-19 cases in those areas. Tashkent is mostly yellow, with some red neighbourhoods which have been cordoned off. The country of 34m people has confirmed 8,298 coronavirus cases, with 24 deaths. , urging us to stay focused on the big picture of a pandemic that is very far from over. The question is do we have the political imagination, the sympathy and the grit necessary to grasp this crisis at the world level? Can public opinion and decision-makers in Europe and Asia, where the disease has been more or less effectively suppressed, be rallied to support an adequate global response to the crisis in the rest of the world? there is mounting concern over the rising number of “imported” coronavirus cases ahead of the Mediterranean country opening to holidaymakers tomorrow. For a nation so reliant on tourism the fact that its archipelago of islands has remained so Covid-free has been crucial to projecting an image of safety and security. But since Greece reopened its main airports in Athens and Thessaloniki on 15 June, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has crept up. Tellingly, almost a third of the 110 new infections logged by authorities over the last week were travellers from abroad. Six of those reported were on Syros, Ios and Paros – all popular islands. On Monday, three of the 15 new cases registered by health officials had arrived from overseas. This morning, media on Zakynthos reported that seven people had now contracted the virus – the latest described as a man admitted to the local hospital on Sunday with a high fever after recently returning from Germany. Most tourists who have thus far been detected with the virus are asymptomatic, adding to the concerns of epidemiologists. “The big problem is that the virus is transmitted via individuals who are asymptomatic or have few symptoms,” said professor Nikolaos Sypsas, a member of the scientific committee that advises the government. “The problem of dispersal via asymptomatic people remains a very big risk. The country’s civil protection ministry says health officials with the armed forces will be dispatched to islands to conduct tests on arriving passengers over the next three months. “They will have absolute responsibility,” said the deputy civil protection minister Nikos Hardalias as he toured regional airports in advance of direct flights to destinations being resumed nationwide on Wednesday. At the weekend Athens’ centre-right government announced that, 48 hours prior to arrival, anyone entering Greece would have to fill out an electronic form, stating personal details and where they had travelled to in recent weeks. With the aid of special software, the input will then be weighed up by health authorities – a form of ‘smart testing’ that is hoped will help identify possible coronavirus carriers. To date Greece has had 3,390 confirmed coronavirus cases and 191 covid-related fatalities – far lower than most other European countries. Fears of the highly contagious virus being imported played a central role in the government deciding to continue its suspensions of air links with the UK and Sweden on Monday. rebounded in May as the country emerged from a coronavirus lockdown that triggered an unprecedented spending slump the previous months, official data has revealed. The Insee official stats agency said that consumer spending rose 36. 6% in May from April, when it had plunged 19. 1% and following a 16% drop in March. A Reuters poll of 16 economists had an average forecast for a 30% increase in May, though estimates of the jump had ranged from 6% to 42. 5% in light of the exceptional circumstances. The French government began lifting restrictions on 11 May after the country spent nearly two months under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. The lockdown left nearly all retail outlets but those deemed essential shuttered, plunging the eurozone’s second-biggest economy into its deepest recession on record in modern peacetime France. Despite the rebound in May, consumer spending remained down 7. 2% from pre-crisis levels in February, Insee said. ahead of the general election on 10 July.

While accessing healthcare has been a challenge faced by older populations during the crisis, the pandemic has also amplified violence and abuse of older people around the world. Chris Roles, the managing director of Age International, said: “Regrettably, the pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated the abuse and neglect older people were already facing. “Too often, elder abuse is kept hidden and not reported; older people may fear retribution or stigma, may not recognise what is happening to them as abuse or national bodies may not even record abuse over a certain age.</data>

			<url>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/jacinda-ardern-decries-dangerous-calls-to-reopen-new-zealand-borders-coronavirus</url>
			<data> Jacinda Ardern has decried as “dangerous” her detractors’ calls to open New Zealand’s borders – or present a plan for how she will do so – as the country remains largely free of Covid-19 while the virus spreads abroad. prime minister referred to “a world where the virus is escalating not slowing and not even peaking in some countries yet, where cases exceed 10 million globally and deaths half a million, where countries are extending and returning to lockdown”. “All of the while, we get to enjoy weekend sport, go to restaurants and bars, our workplaces are open, and we can gather in whatever numbers we like,” she said. She appeared to be responding to Todd Muller – the leader of the opposition and the centre-right National party – who, along with business leaders, branded as “untenable” the prospect of keeping the country’s borders sealed for months or years until a Covid-19 vaccine is found. A swift, strict lockdown of the country in March and April appeared to have eliminated community transmission of the virus shortly after it appeared in New Zealand – with New Zealanders returning to the country accounting for all the 22 current cases diagnosed. The nation has become an international success story for addressing Covid-19 but it now faces a world where preserving that status means tightly sealed borders. “A strategy that says we stay completely closed to everybody for the next 12 to 18 months is simply untenable,” Muller told the Wellington Chamber of Commerce in a speech on Monday. “We won’t recognise this country in terms of economic impact. He added in a statement on Tuesday that he was not advocating an immediate reopening of borders, but wanted to know how and when they would be “progressively reopened”. Only New Zealanders and their families are allowed to enter the country, along with some government-approved essential workers. Returnees must spend two weeks in government-managed quarantine at designated hotels; they are tested for Covid-19 twice during their stay and are not permitted to leave isolation for a further two weeks if they refuse a test. The quarantine rules were drastically tightened after it was discovered that health officials had let dozens leave early on compassionate exemptions without testing; two women arriving from Britain were allowed out before both were diagnosed with Covid-19. They have since recovered and did not appear to have spread it to anyone else. All 22 cases active in the country now were diagnosed through routine testing at the quarantine hotels; 21 of those who have it remain in isolation, with one in a stable condition in hospital. Fewer than 1,200 confirmed cases of the virus have been diagnosed in New Zealand; 22 people have died. The apparent elimination of community transmission means life has returned to normal domestically, with only the strict border rules remaining in place. “These are hard-won gains, and we have as a government no intention of squandering them,” Ardern said on Tuesday. “The idea that we should open our border in this environment has a price, and that price could be a second wave of Covd-19 in our country at worst – at best, added restrictions for the rest of us. Her government has been in talks to pursue a so-called trans-Tasman bubble of quarantine-free travel with Australia and the Pacific Islands, although she has said it would not be safe to implement such a strategy yet. Ardern on Monday sternly warned New Zealanders against recreational travel abroad, despite the European Union’s announcement that the country was on its new list of accepted travellers. She said those leaving New Zealand for non-essential reasons could be forced to pay for their mandatory two-week quarantine upon returning – to the tune of thousands of dollars. She is seeking legal advice to confirm she could implement such a rule. In response to Muller’s call for a plan to reopen the country, she said: “In the short term, where we have an environment where we don’t have large-scale effective treatment, where we don’t have a vaccine, where we don’t have short-term turnaround on testing, and while the pandemic is surging, that means in the short-term we’re looking for countries in a similar position to us.</data>

			<data> bounties for attacks on US forces in Afghanistan, multiple US media have reported on Monday night. The president said on Sunday he was not told of the allegations because the information was not “credible”. the president received in late February. Senior White House officials were aware as far back as early 2019 and the intelligence assessment was included in at least one of the president’s written daily briefings, the Associated Press reported, according to multiple officials. Trump is said to prefer oral briefings several times a week rather than to read the daily written document prepared for US presidents. The reports emerged late on Monday, after the White House briefed Republican lawmakers on the intelligence assessment. In an unusual step, Democratic lawmakers were not included in the initial briefing, which was conducted by the national security adviser, the director of national intelligence and the White House chief of staff. would be briefed at the White House on Tuesday at 8am. Trump has publicly attacked the strength of the intelligence about the alleged bounty program. An initial report on the program last week by the New York Times, which has since been widely corroborated, raised the question of why the United States had not taken action in response to the suspected targeting of US soldiers. Trump claimed on Sunday that he had never been briefed on the intelligence assessment. Later that day he said that intelligence officials told him the threat was not “credible”. But Trump was contradicted in the White House briefing room on Monday by the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who said that views about the veracity of the intelligence were mixed within the intelligence community. “There is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations, and in effect there are dissenting opinions from some in the intelligence community with regard to the veracity of what’s being reported, and the veracity of the underlying allegations continues to be evaluated,” McEnany said. Susan Hennessey, executive editor of the Lawfare website at the Brookings Institution, replied on Twitter: “This smells like the White House trying to mislead the public. “It is common for different intelligence agencies to attach different degrees of confidence based on the manner on underlying intel; that isn’t the same as there being disagreement over whether something happened,” Hennessey wrote. “Maybe there really is a disagreement between agencies on whether this happened at all. But there is strong consensus among the reporting and the language the White House is using sure seems designed to obfuscate. the Washington Post that “the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated,” while the CIA, state department and defense department all declined comment. on Monday that the bounty program was believed to have resulted in deaths of US troops. Top Republican members on the House armed services and foreign affairs committees were briefed on Monday by the White House. Congresswoman Katherine Clark, the vice-chair of the Democratic caucus, questioned Trump’s reaction to having purportedly been left in the dark about the bounty program. “The president is saying that he did not know of this, but where’s the outrage from him, that he didn’t know about this? ” Clark told Fox news. “Where is his questioning and demands for information? Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, denied on Monday that such a bounty program existed. “You know, maybe I can say it’s a little bit rude but this is 100% bullshit,” Peskov told NBC News’ Keir Simmons.</data>

The news was announced by musician and friend Michael Feinstein, who said: “A dear friend and extraordinary composer arranger and all-around brilliant talent Johnny Mandel just passed away. The world will never be quite the same without his humour, wit and wry view of life and the human condition. He was truly beyond compare, and nobody could write or arrange the way he did. Lord will we miss him. Let’s celebrate him with his music! He would like that. , who called him “a genius and one of my favourite writers, arrangers, and personalities. He was a beast. Mandel was born in New York in 1925, the son of an aspiring opera singer mother. , and learned trumpet and trombone, finding early work with jazz bands and orchestras headed by Count Basie, Buddy Rich, Jimmy Dorsey and more. He also played in a group with Alan Greenspan, who went on to become a long-standing chair of the US Federal Reserve. “Alan was very bookish and a nice guy,” Mandel later remembered. He also did the payroll, so we always got paid on time. Mandel began composing and arranging, and over the years created orchestral arrangements for Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett and more, but became most celebrated for film scoring. Mandel wrote it after being inspired by a California vista on the film set. “I saw that gorgeous panorama, shooting from Big Sur out on to the ocean. How do you write that? I figured, you write it with a solo voice . .. I’d try to translate that into what it looked like. ” Originally recorded with a choir, it was covered by Bennett, Streisand, Stevie Wonder, Astrud Gilberto and many more. with Paul Newman, to family movies (Freaky Friday, Escape from Witch Mountain), and comedies like Caddyshack. He repeatedly worked with directors Hal Ashby, Sidney Lumet and Robert Altman, for whom he wrote Suicide is Painless with Altman’s teenage son Michael writing lyrics – it became the theme for M*A*S*H and its spinoff TV show, and Mandel’s most famous work. Mandel also won five Grammys, mostly for his arrangements, with Shadow of Your Smile winning song of the year in 1965. He also composed for TV, and earned Emmy nominations for scores to TV movies A Letter to Three Wives, LBJ: The Early Years and Foxfire.</data>

The emergency cut in UK interest rates, to just 0. 1%, has prompted banks and building societies to slash their own rates - meaning income on savings is extremely thin. has calculated that variable rate savings accounts have dropped by the largest amount seen over the first six months of any year since 2009. , says savers will feel “frustrated and disappointed”, as their incomes are hit by the Coronavirus pandemic and base rate cuts. These rate cuts should be more than enough reason to give savers a push to switch their deal if they are getting a poor return on their hard-earned cash. Indeed, on an easy access account, savers could be earning as little as 0. 01%, such as with NatWest, but the best rate on the market pays 1. 15% from National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I) – on a £20,000 deposit, that is a difference in interest over 12 months of £228. If savers were looking to lock their cash away over the next 18 months, then the best deal comes from Bank of London and The Middle East (BLME), paying 1. 15% as an expected profit rate, which is 0. 44% more than the average rate today. “If savers are looking for a decent return but do not wish to lock their money away for a year or more, then a notice account could be a good bridge between fixed and easy access accounts. One example of a deal with a short notice term is ICICI Bank UK’s 45-day notice account, which pays 1. 24% gross monthly and is available through Raisin UK. Just in: the eurozone has crept away from deflation, as consumers are hit by rising food prices. Prices across the single currency region rose by 0. 3% per year in June, up from just 0. 1% y/y in the previous month. Food, drink and alcohol price continued to rise steeply, while energy prices remained much lower than a year ago. In June 2020, a month in which many COVID-19 containment measures have been gradually lifted, Euro area annual inflation is expected to be 0. 3%, up from 0. Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in June (3. 1%, compared with 3. 4% in May), followed by services (1. 2%, compared with 1. 3% in May), non-energy industrial goods (0. 2%, stable compared with May) and energy (-9. inflation unexpectedly rises to +0. 3% YoY from previous +0. 1%, more than expedcted +0. 1%, with core inflation rising +0.

UK housebuilder Redrow has sent a shiver through the property sector this morning, as it warned that profits will be badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak. Redrow told shareholders that it is scaling back its operations in London. Following the lockdown, there is more demand for houses with space to work inside, and nice places to visit nearby. So, the company is focusing more on regional development, and less in the capital. Recent studies have highlighted that the Covid-19 pandemic has shifted home movers’ priorities. In particular, there is a desire for more inside and outside space, wanting to live closer to green spaces and having better home workspace. Redrow’s reputation for placemaking and its award winning Heritage product ideally position the business to meet these changing customer priorities. Following a review of our divisional businesses, we have decided to scale-back our operations in London to focus on the Colindale Gardens development [in North West London] and continue to target the Group’s future growth on the higher returning regional businesses and the Heritage product. The costs and related significant impairments associated with scaling-back the London business will be provided for in the June 2020 accounts. As a consequence of the impact of Covid-19 and making these provisions the profit for 2020 will be substantially below 2019. Redrow has also found that the new social-distancing rules mean it takes longer to build houses, and also longer to hand them over to customers.

Shell told the City this morning that it has lowered its long-term outlook on oil and gas prices. As a result it will record a post-tax, non-cash impairment charges of between $15bn to $22bn in the second quarter. Given the impact of COVID-19 and the ongoing challenging commodity price environment, Shell continues to adapt to ensure the business remains resilient.

Many companies have scrapped their earnings guidance, as they simply don’t know how many goods or services they’ll sell this year. It all depends on the progress in combating Covid-19, which is still accelerating worldwide. Neil Wilson of Markets. Valuations still look too high and based on a far-too-optimistic view of an earnings rebound in 2021 and does not account for permanent productivity and demand destruction. Of course stimulus is making a big difference here, but risk assets are exposed if we see the pandemic get worse from here. World Health Organisation boss Tedros said the worst is yet to come. Cases across states like Arizona, Texas and Florida continue to surge and look to be completely out of control. A short, sharp pullback is a very real possibility. Nevertheless, it’s been a solid month and an exceptionally strong quarter. US equities have enjoyed their best quarter in 20 years, whilst stocks in Europe have fared pretty well too as investors participated in the rebound off the March lows. It’s mirrored elsewhere in risk assets – copper is up a fifth, but is slightly weaker for the year. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 is up 18% QTD, but down 5% YTD. 100 is up almost 10% QTD, but down over 17% YTD. 100 has dipped by 30 points, or 0. 5%, at the start of trading - but is still on track for its best quarter since the financial crisis. Households’ consumption spending decreased by £9. 7%) in Quarter 1 2020, the largest quarterly fall in nominal household spending of this type ever recorded; there were large falls in expenditure on motor vehicles, restaurants and hotels, and clothing and footwear. Britain’s economy suffered an even more bruising blow from Covid-19 than previously thought. UK GDP shrank by 2. 2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to updated figures from The Office for National Statistics. That’s down from a previous estimate of a 2% decline -- and is the joint-worst quarter since Margaret Thatcher was settling into Downing Street. UK gross domestic product (GDP) in volume terms fell by 2. 2% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, revised downwards by 0. 2 percentage points from the first quarterly estimate; this is now the joint largest fall in UK GDP since Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 1979. When compared with the same quarter a year ago, UK GDP decreased by 1. 7% in Quarter 1 2020, a downward revision of 0. 1 percentage points from the previous estimate. This release captures the first direct effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the government measures taken to reduce transmission of the virus. The services, production and construction sectors provided a negative contribution to growth in the output approach to GDP in Quarter 1 2020; with services output falling by a record 2. 3% in the latest quarter. The British economy shrinking 2. Global stock markets have enjoyed a sizzling quarter, even as the death toll from Covid-19 has marched higher and economies have fallen deep into recession. World equities have surged by 18% between the start of April and the end of June, according to MSCI’s All Country World Index. That’s its biggest advance in 11 years, and the second best quarter in at least two decades. It means stocks have recovered some, but not all, of the heavy losses suffered during the crash in the first quarter of the year. The financial markets have clearly already priced in a recovery, helped by huge stimulus packages, record low interest rates, and a generous flurry of money-printing by the world’s central banks. Investors are weighing better economic figures against a continued increase in virus cases. S. pending home sales figures Monday, China Tuesday reported improving purchasing-manager indexes for both manufacturing and services.

The rebound comes even as deaths from the virus surpass 500,000 and confirmed cases exceed 10 million, with the World Health Organization warning the worst is yet to come. “It’s not clear what trajectory coronavirus is heading,” Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said on Bloomberg TV. “But I also think because we’re into quarter-end, there’s been some re-balancing. So I’m kind of in the camp that any weakness is short-lived. I would think July is going to be a strong month for stocks. , despite the ongoing pandemic. says today’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs both send a positive signal for the economy. Can it be sustained? Demand for materials and products for the development of advanced technology, the real estate market and infrastructure projects support growing manufacturing activity. The foreign orders PMI at 42. 6 in June confirms that external demand remains weak. We believe that the ongoing Covid-19 situation in the US and Europe will keep the pressure on export orders in the coming months. External demand weakness is putting pressure on some manufacturers, especially small factories, of which the sub-index PMI fell to 48. 9 in June from 50. 8 a month ago. This confirms our view that small manufacturers continue to struggle to get export orders. The better-than-expected China PMI lends further weight to the argument that a global cyclical recovery is well underway. Encouragingly, there was a broad improvement in the details for the manufacturing PMI with output, new orders and new export orders all rising from last month. China factory outlook is brighter in June as recovery continues: PMI index rose to 50. 9 from 50. 6 a month earlier. The non-manufacturing PMI rose to 54. 4; readings above 50 indicate improving conditions from prev.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some upbeat economic news from China is cheering investors on the final day of June, boosting optimism that the world economy is turning the corner. China’s factories grew at a slightly faster pace this month, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics. in May (anything over 50 indicates growth). It’s the fourth month of (modest) growth in a row, as China emerged from the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 in January and February. Chinese manufacturers reported that supply and demand are starting to pick up, leading to more new orders. orders are still down, meaning factories are still shedding jobs. In a statement, NBS official Zhao Qinghe said there was still much uncertainty about the economic outlook, with small Chinese companies finding conditions particularly tough. China PMI comes in at 50. 9 in June. That's a positive reading, but only just. Based on the PMI's, China's recovery is steady but unspectacular. That’s the best reading of the year. The recovery should remain robust in the coming months as strong infrastructure spending offsets external weakness. ICYMI: There were further modest signs of recovery in China this month, with the official NBS non-manufacturing PMI rising to a 7-month high of 54. 4 in June, while the manufacturing PMI edged higher to 50. Following an unexpected surge in US home sales on Monday, this may bolster hopes that the world economy may be gingerly emerging from the coronavirus slump. European stock markets are expected to rise a little this morning, at the end of one of the strongest quarters in decades. has gained almost 10% since the start of April - its best quarter since 2010. has enjoyed its strongest gains since 1998. Astonishing, really, given the world is still gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic. Clearly the unprecedented stimulus from central banks has reassured investors, even though a V-shaped recovery looks rather unlikely. And most markets are still deep in the red for the year, due to the crash in February and March. 10am BST: Eurozone core inflation for June - expected to remain at 0.</data>

			<data> because of the country’s rising infection rate in a move that risks antagonising Donald Trump. In an attempt to save the European tourism season, a list of 15 countries from where people should be allowed into the EU from 1 July has been agreed by representatives of the 27 member states. Travellers from China will be among those permitted entry if Beijing reciprocates despite doubts over the accuracy of the information coming out of the country. The other countries from where the EU agrees travel should be permitted into the bloc are Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. and India, where infection rates remain high, are set to remain excluded despite the initial arguments of some EU governments which would like to have offered further help in keeping the tourism industry afloat. At the height of the pandemic in mid-March, the European commission had advised member states that non-essential travel from outside the EU should not be permitted. The list, which will be updated every two weeks, is only advisory and EU member states can deviate if they wish. But the capitals have been warned of the dangers if they go their own way and expand the number of countries from where travel is permitted. Despite leaving the EU on 31 January, the UK has been treated as a member state as it remains part of the bloc’s single market. But while Brussels has been keen to coordinate with the British government, Downing Street has not been involved in the EU’s internal deliberations and the bloc’s conclusions on who can travel to the bloc are not legally binding. The EU’s member states had procrastinated for days over relaxing travel restrictions and was split between those wary of ditching the progress made in containing coronavirus, including the Netherlands, whose Schiphol airport is a key hub, and countries such as Italy, Cyprus and Portugal, which are determined to make the most of the summer season. had suggested it would unilaterally reopen to the US, according to EU sources. The Greek government has since agreed to comply with the joint decision. , moved from being sceptical about the length of the list to backing it on economic grounds. EU diplomats said travellers from European “micro-states” such as Andorra, Vatican City, Monaco and San Marino will also be given the green light. The approved countries have been selected on the basis of the reliability of their data, infection rates and reciprocity. A key threshold is the EU average infection rate of around 16 per 100,000 inhabitants, with only those countries with comparable or better rates considered for inclusion. “There is a treaty-based obligation to ensure coordination in order not to put at risk the functioning of the Schengen area,” an advisory document circulated among the member states says. “While a more restrictive approach would not endanger, as such, the functioning of the Schengen area, a less restrictive approach than the one coordinated at EU+ area level could entail such a risk. Spain’s foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, told Spain’s Cadena SER radio: “This is not an exercise to be nice or unfriendly to other countries, this is an exercise of self-responsibility. Individual EU member states are able to impose their own travel restrictions on the UK based on scientific advice. The Irish government has also said it will maintain a 14-day quarantine given the UK’s high infection rate and Greece is maintaining a ban on flights from Britain.</data>

			<data> , come with me on a tour through the magical world of the evening News programme on Polish state television (TVP). We start on Sunday 14 June. The first item marks the 80th anniversary of the first deportation of Poles to Auschwitz in 1940. This is indeed a moment worthy of the most solemn remembrance. Too many people around the world forget that innocent and sometimes heroic Poles were the first prisoners in Auschwitz. But in the entire news item, lasting more than four minutes, the words ‘Jewish victims’ do not appear once. Instead, the head of the Institute of National Remembrance tells viewers: “That was the purpose of Auschwitz – that there would never be an independent Poland; to murder it. ” No other groups of victims are mentioned until the footage of a memorial ceremony in Berlin, where the Polish ambassador to Germany says that from the moment of the creation of Auschwitz “we talk of the Holocaust”. Soon the programme turns to what can only be described as pure election propaganda for the candidate of the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), Trump’s pal Duda, the country’s current president. Unidentified woman: He’s a great patriot and really we need such patriots, and not any of those egoists. Now the Jews do get an explicit mention, as the programme characterises the two candidates’ allegedly different responses to Jewish restitution claims, or, as the announcer puts it “giving money back to the Jews for the second world war”. Then comes an attack on Trzaskowski for his “way of thinking, thinking not in line with Polish interests”. This is evidenced by the fact that he participated in a meeting of the Bilderberg group in the Swiss resort of Montreux: “The meetings are shrouded in secrecy; it is not known what decisions were taken here in Switzerland. ” Cut to another supposedly expert interviewee, who says: “The Germans export to us candidates for the highest positions, such as [Donald] Tusk, and now such a German candidate is Trzaskowski. “Experts have no doubt [that] the stream of money that currently flows from the state budget into the pockets of Polish families will dry up if Trzaskowski, after his possible victory in the presidential election, will seek to satisfy Jewish demands. And so it goes on, day after day, with the crude, mendacious, repetitive blows characteristic of propaganda. Polish state television makes Fox News look like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. , widely known as “TVPiS”. With the ruling party obviously rattled by the Trzaskowski challenge, it has now plumbed new depths. that, between 3 and 16 June, nearly 97% of TVP News stories devoted to Duda were positive while almost 87% of those on Trzaskowski were negative. Worse than that, it has descended into the paranoid mental world of the far right, where spotless, heroic, perpetually misunderstood Poles are being conspired against by dark international German-Jewish-LGBT-plutocratic forces meeting secretly in Swiss chateaux. for more than 40 years and have constantly struggled against a widespread western stereotype of this fascinating, complicated country as stiff-necked, narrow-minded, reactionary, nationalist and antisemitic. Now here is state television comprehensively reinforcing that stereotype. Professedly defending Poland’s good name, TVP is besmirching it. Detecting anti-Polish forces everywhere, it is itself an anti-Polish force, doing serious damage to the country’s reputation in the world. What can be done about this? First, Polish voters will have the chance, probably in a second round of the presidential election on 12 July, to vote out Duda, who – disappointing early hopes that he might show statesmanlike independence – has proved to be a PiS-man through and through. The issue here is not whether undecided swing voters particularly like Trzaskowski, let alone his Civic Platform party, which many are fed up with. It is whether Poland will have some counterbalance at the highest level to prevent further damage to the rule of law, democracy and the country’s international standing. For if Duda is reelected, PiS will have three years without significant elections in which to do to Polish democracy what Viktor Orbán has already done to Hungarian democracy – emasculate it. Second, we need to defend media pluralism. Media scholars distinguish between internal and external pluralism. Internal pluralism means you get a wide range of political views inside one channel, radio station, newspaper or online platform. ) External pluralism means different political tendencies are represented by separate channels, stations etc. Internal pluralism is better because a truly liberal democracy requires informed citizens who are exposed to a wide range of facts, arguments and opinions even if they only watch one channel. But in Poland that was never fully realised after 1989 – public television was always inclined to sway under pressure from governing parties, although incomparably less crudely than today – and the chances of achieving it are now remote. All the more vital, then, to keep the external pluralism that the country does still enjoy. There are newspapers such as the historic Gazeta Wyborcza, weeklies such as the Polish Newsweek, online platforms such as onet. pl, and the independent journalism site oko. press, which recently won Index on Censorship’s Freedom of Expression award. And there is a major independent TV channel, TVN, which is owned by the US-based Discovery channel. I often watch TVN24’s evening news programme, Facts, which has roughly the same number of viewers as News. Facts is not BBC-style impartial: it clearly favours a more liberal, pro-European Poland and is strongly anti-PiS. But unlike the so-called News, it is still definitely professional, high quality, reality-based journalism. (Think something between CNN and MSNBC. But even then, the long-term future of democracy in Poland will depend on defending free and diverse media.</data>

			<url>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/europeans-believe-in-more-cohesion-despite-eus-covid-19-failings</url>
			<data> Deep public disappointment in the EU’s fragmented coronavirus response and European governments’ handling of the pandemic is revealed by newly released polling across the continent. An overwhelming majority nevertheless say the pandemic has convinced them that EU governments should cooperate more closely in the face of future external threats. and, asked who their most useful ally had been during the darkest days of the crisis, only 4% of Italians cited the EU while 25% said China. The numbers who perceived the EU’s performance as poor (more than half in France) are exceeded by those who said the bloc was “irrelevant” as soaring death tolls left some communities struggling to bury their dead. Large majorities in all the nations surveyed felt that either their country was left to cope alone or they simply did not know who their most helpful ally was. Europeans in nine countries that make up roughly two-thirds of the EU population were surveyed for the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank as their governments began to plan for loosening lockdowns. The resulting report, by Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, describes the levels of public disillusionment as “disturbing” as EU leaders debate a recovery plan that will involve raising trillions of euros in public funding. They say the findings also challenge the view that the pandemic fuelled a surge in support for expanding the role of the state. Across the nine survey countries, 33% say they have lost confidence in the capacity of governments to act based on their handling of the pandemic, and only 29% think that the crisis proves the need for a bigger role for the state. While approval ratings for national leaders soared in March, as anxious citizens sought reassurance and governments stepped in to save livelihoods, by the end of April, 61% in France said the Macron government had under-performed and felt more disillusioned about the role of governments since the arrival of Covid-19. In Spain, 54% expressed dissatisfaction with Pedro Sanchez’s government’s management of the crisis. However, widespread disappointment with the EU response has not so far translated into a boost for Eurosceptic populism. A convincing majority, 63%, including 55% in Germany, 80% in Spain and 91% in Portugal, believed the pandemic showed the need for EU governments to act more cohesively. In Italy, 76% wanted a recovery led by the EU and only 16% said the pandemic had shown Matteo Salvini’s anti-EU populist Lega party in an improved light. Nor has the crisis boosted support for Spain’s populists – 54% said the far right Vox party had gone down in their estimation since the arrival of the coronavirus. Marine Le Pen’s party in France flat-lined while in Germany just 6% reported an “improved” view of the far-right AfD as a result of the crisis. But as politicians’ focus shifts from health to confronting the worst recession since the second world war, the report warns EU leaders against assuming that the demand for greater cohesion represents a vote of confidence in EU structures, or a public willingness to share the costs. Only in southern and eastern Europe does this polling show strong support for financial burden-sharing. to rescue the European economy as a “Hamilton” moment, a pandemic-inspired move towards fiscal union, which mirrors the foundational steps of the US under its first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton. The driving force for more EU cooperation appears to be the way the coronavirus crisis dramatically altered how fearfully the world beyond Europe is seen: 60% of Europeans said their view of the US had worsened, while 48% said they thought more negatively of China. The authors identify the biggest constituency of opinion in Europe as those who believe EU nations must act cohesively in the pandemic era for self-protection. “For them, Europe is no longer mainly a project motivated by ideas and values, it is a community of fate that must cling together to take back control over its future. ” the report says. There is widespread backing for tightening the EU’s external borders and pushing European businesses to produce more of the supplies needed in emergencies. The research also knocks hopes that the pandemic had restored the standing of experts in the public mind. of her relief at how coronavirus elevated the role of science in society. But while most Danes and Swedes have confidence in expertise – 64% and 61% respectively – 65% of Europeans on average said they have low trust in experts and fear they collude to keep information secret. Even in Germany, where the rates of infection have been low, 56% are wary about relying on expertise, the European council on foreign relations survey shows. The survey of 10,000 people was conducted at the end of April by Datapraxis and YouGov in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Bulgaria, Denmark and Sweden, with pan-European figures aggregated to reflect relative population size.</data>

			<data> efore the second world war, remembering history served only to glorify nations, to stir up revanchism or to sanctify heroes. , the attempt to deal with its Nazi shame by collectively confronting the unspeakable crimes of the Third Reich rather than evading them. This process, which started at the end of the 60s after two decades of collective amnesia, allowed something positive to grow from a negative legacy: Germany’s rehabilitation and reconstruction into one of the strongest democracies in the world. Germany’s culture of remembrance could inspire countries such as Britain which have trouble understanding that in order to transform the weight of the past into wealth, it must confront history’s shadows – not ignore them. I grew up in France, where I was born to a French mother and a German father. Twenty years ago, I moved to Berlin. and German society. It guides its actions and behaviours in every sphere, from politics to the media, civil society, education, the judiciary, the police, trade unions, the economic and the intellectual worlds. Respect, dialogue, separation of powers, discernment and nuance are the guiding concepts. A solid social contract between citizens and public authorities has as a result been established, based on transparency and shared democratic responsibility. Certainly, anger is understandable when authorities allow figures such as King Leopold II of Belgium, or the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, to go on being honoured in public places without any contextualisation. But iconoclasm often only serves an illusion of justice. Soon after comes the forgetting. The missed opportunity to use our past to know ourselves better is all that remains. to the Bundestag in 1985. , in the Americas, as well as in the Arab world and the Ottoman empire, thought like them. They may not have had actual blood on their hands, but many people benefitted directly or indirectly from the cruel and savage domination of man over man that slavery and colonialism entailed. The complicity of this mass of people with a criminal system seems much more central a question to me than the guilt of an individual slave trader or a sadistic colonist. , when most non-white human beings were considered soulless, than in more modern times. How, in the 19th and 20th centuries, could countries such as the US, Britain and France, which boasted of how they championed democracy and freedom, unscrupulously oppress and exploit people under the pretext of “enlightening” them? The oppression continued long after the second world war, after they had proclaimed their moral superiority over fascism. damaged the model of parliamentary democracy worldwide? Millions of American and European citizens took part in this unbearable hypocrisy, this immorality. This reflection is central, because it sends each one of us back to our present-day responsibilities. It helps us become aware of our own contradictions and of the consequences of our behaviour. One doesn’t have to serve an unfair system directly to be complicit with it. Following the crowd through indifference, opportunism or conformism is also form of complicity. In 1938, he took advantage of antisemitic Nazi policies to buy a business from a Jewish family for a low price. After the war, the only survivor of this family, the rest of whom perished in Auschwitz, demanded reparations, but my grandfather refused to acknowledge his responsibility. was tiny on an individual level, their small everyday acts of cowardice, opportunism and turning a blind eye created the conditions necessary for the functioning of a criminal system. central to this task of coming to terms with the past. This helped to sharpen younger citizens’ awareness of their fallibility, their malleability and to arm them against demagogues and manipulators of hatred and lies. As a result they were able to transform collective guilt into democratic responsibility. But even Germany is not immune. , entered the German parliament for the first time since the end of the war. Nevertheless, learning from the past is a process that needs to be continually nourished and rethought, just like democracy. The toppling of Edward Colston's statue is not an attack on history. Facing up to the shadows of history shouldn’t be done in a culture of guilt. Nor should it be instrumentalised to stir up hatred or sectarianism, or to nourish an anachronistic and Manichean vision of the past. However, coming to terms with the past is impossible without an essential step: taking the perspective of the victim, the oppressed, the occupied, the humiliated. And being able to apologise. Yet, how many still shy away from this process. , as well as the economic exploitation and racial segregation operated in its colonies, is not just shocking but casts suspicion over its entire colonial legacy. In Britain, remembering the mistakes of history doesn’t seem to be part of national education in schools, museums or in most of the media. And how many streets and statues still honour leaders of the fallen empire! This counterproductive attitude reveals a profound misunderstanding of how important coming to terms with the past is for the democratic maturation of a country. Keeping memory alive is not a moral accessory to look good. It helps us, together, to shape the future. It guides us to understand the world instead of suffer it, to avoid mistakes, to identify dangers – those that come from others but, above all, those that come from ourselves. It helps us to live more consciously.</data>

			<data> ome are crying in their cots; others are being cradled or bottle-fed by nannies. These newborns are not in the nursery of a maternity hospital, they are lined up side by side in two large reception rooms of the improbably named Hotel Venice on the outskirts of Kyiv, protected by outer walls and barbed wire. They are the children of foreign couples born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers at the Kyiv-based BioTexCom Centre for Human Reproduction, the largest surrogacy clinic in the world. since borders closed in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Anxious parents check on the children they have not yet met via video calls, and others have sent audio recordings of their voices to soothe the children. BioTexCom released video footage from the hotel in mid-May to highlight the heartbreaking dilemma for parents and to lobby for an easing of border closures. around the world, but a month on, some 50 babies remain in the hotel and the saga is casting a harsh spotlight on the ethics and scale of the booming commercial child-bearing industry in Ukraine. reforming a system he described as a violation of children’s rights was not enough and that surrogacy services for foreign couples in Ukraine should be banned. In a cash-strapped economy however, where the average wage is £300 a month and the war with Russia and its proxies continues, many impoverished women, especially in small towns and rural areas, are still lining up to carry babies for money, even if they are paying a heavy health and psychological price, as campaigners believe. In Vinnytsia, a city south-west of Kyiv, Liudmyla is still waiting to receive the balance of her fee for giving birth to a baby girl for a German couple in February. She regularly texts her surrogacy agency (not BioTexCom), which she says owes her €6,000. “They keep telling me they can’t send the entire sum because of the lockdown,” she says. Though Liudmyla, 39, had an embryo transfer in Kyiv and spent most of her pregnancy in Vinnytsia, the agency asked her to travel to Poland to give birth so that the baby could be registered there. “I didn’t want to give her away, I was crying,” Liudmyla recalls. She says that after two days of caring for the infant in the maternity ward, letting her go was a wrench. “But I knew what it was all about. A shop assistant and a single mother, Luidmyla struggled for years to find a home for herself and her own three children that would be better than the one room in a hostel that they had. So in 2017 she went to a surrogacy clinic, and with the money she was able to take out a mortgage on an apartment. Even though she was placed in an intensive care unit as a result of complications in the pregnancy, Liudmyla decided to have a second surrogate baby to pay back most of the loan for the flat. that several thousand children are born to surrogate mothers in Ukraine each year. Eighty per cent of these babies are for foreign couples, who choose Ukraine because the process is legal and cheap. Sergii Antonov, a fertility lawyer, says Ukrainian surrogate agencies occasionally organise for the babies to be born abroad because this can make the birth registration process easier. The price of a surrogacy package in Ukraine starts from £25,000, with the surrogate mother receiving at least £10,000. Intended parents are generally required to be married heterosexual couples and to have proof of their infertility diagnosis. clinics and agencies place their ads in newspapers, on public transport or in social media groups. Tetiana Shulzhynska, 38, writes to such groups, trying to persuade women to stay away from surrogacy because she thinks some of them end up paying with their health or even their lives. “In a contract, they protect only babies, they don’t care about us,” she says, sitting on a bed in her tiny wooden house in Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine. Tetiana Shulzhynska goes through her medical records at her home in Chernihiv, northern Ukraine. Shulzhynska, a mother of two who used to work as a trolley bus conductor, went to a surrogacy clinic in 2013 because she desperately needed to pay back a bank loan. She was so broke that the clinic sent her money to buy the ticket to Kyiv. She agreed to carry a baby for an Italian couple, and within two months it turned out she had four living embryos in her womb. The biological family decided to keep only one and the rest were removed surgically. In May 2014 Shulzhynska gave birth to a baby girl, which she gave away to the parents. She received a fee of €9,000. Seven months later she went to a hospital with severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnosed cervical cancer. It took her almost a year to raise money for surgery. Shulzhynska suspects the cancer was caused by her surrogacy, although there is no proof of this. She has recently ordered crutches because her doctors plan to amputate her left leg, which is now affected by the spreading cancer. In 2015, Shulzhynska filed a complaint against BioTexCom alleging damage caused to her health, which led to a criminal investigation that is ongoing. Yuriy Kovalchuk, a former state prosecutor whose office oversaw a series of criminal investigations into BioTexCom in 2018 and 2019, says at least three other women went to law enforcement after having their wombs removed following surrogate pregnancies organised by the company. inquiry in 2016, after an Italian couple discovered in 2011 that the children they had taken home were not genetically related to them. Kovalchuk was removed from his post last year and believes the investigations into BioTexCom have stalled as a result. He wrote to the ombudsman’s office in May outlining his concerns about the clinic. An Argentinian couple meet their son for the first time at Hotel Venice. A nurse carries a newborn to meet its parents as foreign couples wait to collect their babies at Hotel Venice. At Hotel Venice, Albert Tochilovsky, the owner of BioTexCom, does not deny there were mix-ups with embryos during surrogacy procedures in 2011 that led to the human trafficking investigation. He blames the error on a lack of experience when the clinic was only a year old, and says: “I don’t think it was only us who used to make mistakes here. If someone starts checking DNA, there will be a lot of scandals. He claims that in at least three cases parents rejected surrogate babies after they were born with health problems. The best-known of them is the case of Bridget, the daughter of an American couple, who was born in 2016 and now lives in an orphanage in Zaporizhia, in eastern Ukraine. “It was a tragedy for us,” Tochilovsky says. Albert Tochilovsky, the owner of BioTexCom. The company’s website advertises “the best surrogate mothers” and Tochilovsky denies mistreatment of any women or any fraud at his clinic. He dismisses Shulzhynska’s cancer claims as “nonsense” and says the firm gives contractual protection to surrogate mothers. “They [women] didn’t lose their health at my place, it happened in maternity hospitals. Our clinic does reproduction technologies, the other procedures are being done at state centres [hospitals] … In many cases we pay compensation. If a womb is removed, we pay [compensation] for this according to the contract. Surrogate mothers are self-organising on social media, where they share advice and warnings about surrogacy agencies. Svitlana Sokolova, a former surrogate mother and now an activist at the NGO Strength of Mothers, which helps surrogates, says she started receiving more complaints about alleged mistreatment during the Covid lockdown. One group of women said their contract obliged them to keep having embryos implanted in their wombs for a year until they got pregnant. “Through this contract, the women became a kind of property,” she says. Maryna Lehenka, a lawyer at La Strada Ukraine, says the charity’s hotline gets around 100 calls a year from surrogate mothers complaining about the stress they experience after giving away babies or problems caused by the hormones they took to increase the chances of pregnancy. She recalls a case when a woman went into hiding in a village because she did not want to give away a surrogate baby. Lehenka agrees with the ombudsman that commercial surrogacy should be banned in Ukraine. Sokolova, who co-owns a surrogacy agency, argues instead for a proper legal framework that would protect the surrogates. “Otherwise, it will just go underground. Despite pressure for regulation of the surrogacy business – there are several draft laws before parliament – experts and insiders doubt major legal changes will be made anytime soon to curb the baby business. Tochilovsky says that if commercial surrogacy became illegal, his clinic would just refocus on embryo donation. “The world’s future is in biotechnology, and most of the money will come into biotechnologies,” he says. Olga, who is on her second surrogate pregnancy, twins for a Chinese couple, waits in a rented apartment in Kyiv. Olga, 26, is going to have her second set of surrogate twin boys for a Chinese couple later this month. To give birth, she came to Kyiv from a town in north-east Ukraine along with her young son and husband, and was placed by the agency in a new flat within walking distance of the maternity hospital. Olga says she is feeling fine and she meets sometimes with three other pregnant surrogate mothers living nearby. Using the $17,000 (£13,500) she will get for the babies, Olga wants to open a coffee shop or a flower boutique back home. “I didn’t kill, I didn’t steal, I made this money in an honest way,” she says. Her son sits next to her; he calls the expected babies “Kirusha and Kirusha”. The only worry Olga has is whether the biological parents will arrive before the twins’ birth. Otherwise, she will have to look after the babies until the parents come. Sokolova says some surrogates have ended up looking after their babies for months. She recalls one case where a surrogate mother adopted a baby after the biological parents rejected it at the last moment. Meanwhile, new babies born to surrogates arrive at BioTexCom almost daily and are placed in the hotel’s makeshift nursery. A group of Argentinian and Spanish couples, some of whom travelled before lockdown, were joyously united with their babies last week, but it is not yet clear when Ukraine’s borders will officially reopen and to which countries. Andrea Diez, from Argentina, meets her newborn son Ignacio at Hotel Venice. Rafael Aires, from Spain, carefully takes his daughter Marta from the baby room to play with her. Aires arrived in Ukraine before the lockdown and has been held up for months, his wife back in Spain. But the complication has not tarnished the couple’s happiness. Aires had been trying for a baby for eight years.</data>

			<data> At 6ft by 8ft, it’s the largest size available on the printer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where she works as a geoinformatics researcher. “I of course want it even bigger,” she says. The map is busier than a usual world map. Rather than showing featureless, flat blue ocean, here the seafloor bursts with detail: mountains, canyons, channels and plains that resemble the texture of land. Ferrini encourages her staff to print pictures of the seafloor features they’re researching and tack them to the map. One example off the coast of Argentina shows ripples in the seafloor reaching a hundred metres high. The map has a distinctly Sherlock Holmes-about-to-break-a-big-case look to it. “I’m trying to see the scale of the ocean,” she explains. “The big picture – but also the fine details. Mapping requires an ability to see the forest as well as the trees – or in this case, the coral as well as the sea. It’s a particular challenge when it comes to the ocean, the vast majority of which is not just unmapped, but unknown. Ferrini’s map is humanity’s best effort to date: a crucial document in what has become a race to map the entire seafloor by the end of the decade. in New York City. When it began, around 6% of the ocean was mapped in accurate detail. – released its latest edition: it has now mapped one-fifth of the seafloor. The stakes are high. A series of reports have warned of the ocean’s impending collapse. , published by the UN Environment Programme in 2015, revealed that the ocean’s very ability to function was in jeopardy. estimated that the ocean economy employed 31 million people full-time and generated $1. 5 trillion each year. Maps – or the lack thereof – play a role in nearly every critical ocean issue, from sea level rise to ocean acidification to biodiversity. The pilot Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, with a map of the Pacific that shows the route of their last flight in 1937. The quest to find her plane has led to attempts to map the seabed. seemed to baffle us: how was it possible that with all our modern technology, something as huge as an entire plane could simply disappear? It’s often said that humanity knows more about the surface of the moon than we do the seafloor. It seems astounding that faraway planets can be more accessible than our own. But we tend to skip over why it is so difficult to map the seafloor: there is a massive obstacle in the way called the ocean. Light travels far and fast in space, but the laser altimeters that we use to chart celestial bodies are ineffective in water – the lasers are simply absorbed. Sound, on the other hand, travels more efficiently underwater than it does in air. The gold standard for seafloor mapping today is a multi-beam echosounder, which can be attached directly on to the hull of a ship. The device sends down a fan of sound waves, which computers decipher into a three-dimensional portrait of the seafloor’s shape and composition. Additional techniques also collect water temperature and salinity along the way. It is slow work. Ferrini recently sent another version of the map, this one blacking out all the uncharted ocean today. The coastlines were lit up with data. So, too, were well-traversed shipping lanes. The rest sat in darkness, except for a few pinpricks of light. New images of the side of the RMS Titanic in her resting place at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, taken during a survey of the wreckage from a manned submersible on an expedition in August 2019. , a Japanese non-profit organisation run on the gambling proceeds of motorboat racing, that is backing Seabed 2030 with $2m every year. In the past, the foundation has addressed thorny global challenges such as eliminating leprosy or fighting food insecurity, and a complete seafloor map fits within its mandate, as well as Japan’s wider national interests. Seabed 2030 would improve Japan’s fisheries management and its tsunami and typhoon preparation, as well as clarify territorial claims in the South China Sea. But the mapping is a truly global collaboration, public and free to use, divided among four regional centres. The Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany took the Southern Ocean; Stockholm University and the University of New Hampshire cover the North Pacific and Arctic; New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research are responsible for the South and West Pacific Ocean. That leaves the largest swath, the entire Atlantic and Indian Oceans, to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University – Ferrini’s team. The finished map itself is created by a fifth centre, based in the UK: the British Oceanographic Data Centre in Southampton. The data is in the public domain, free to use, adapt and commercially exploit. “Pretty much anybody doing some kind of [ocean] research should probably be using or has used the Gebco data,” says Rochelle Wigley, the project’s director at the University of New Hampshire. “A lot of fibre optic cable companies have used it, people interested in tsunamis and storm surge, people looking to characterise habitat or modelling ocean currents. It is making remarkable new discoveries all the time. Off Florida, a reef of mid-ocean corals turned up; in the Gulf of Mexico, a shipwreck. A forthcoming study on ice sheets will use Gebco to unpack how the ocean influences melting and raises sea levels. The ‘Seabed Constructor’ in the southern Indian Ocean off the coast of South Africa, on 4 January 2018. The ship and its unmanned submarines has been scouring the ocean floor for wreckage from flight MH370. Deep-sea mining – a controversial plan to excavate huge areas of underwater resources, in what would be the largest mining operation the Earth has ever seen – requires maps, too. to several state-owned and private companies to prospect in the deep sea; permission to start mining could come as soon as this year. In many cases, however, the deep-sea miners are way ahead of the Gebco mappers. on seabed mining, says mining companies are looking for specific things – hard evidence of minerals, either visual or actual samples. “From an industry perspective, they need more advanced data” than Gebco, he says. “And [they] have, in many instances, already collected it. Where Gebco could be used in deep-sea mining, however, would be to help the ISA to better regulate the industry, he says – something of a double-edged sword, depending on your point of view. Another potential controversy is whether mapping introduces more noise to an already noisy ocean. Air guns, naval sonar and shipping traffic are increasingly edging out marine mammals that rely on sound to hunt, navigate and communicate. New research from graduate student Hilary Kates Varghese at the University of New Hampshire revealed that the multi-beam echosounders used by Seabed 2030 did not disrupt the feeding behaviour of Cuvier’s beaked whale, one of the more sonically sensitive marine mammals. However, research biologist Annamaria DeAngelis at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out that because Seabed 2030 is mapping the entire ocean, “more studies will be needed to expand our knowledge of how their particular echosounders will affect marine mammals in a variety of habitats. An undated supplied image from Geoscience Australia shows a computer generated three-dimensional view of the sea floor. One way to reduce noise is to crowdsource from ships that are already charting the ocean. When the multimillionaire Victor Vescovo went on a mission to reach the deepest point of all five oceans, Seabed 2030 mappers collected soundings along the journey. Other industry partners are donating whatever data they can. Crowdsourcing is crucial – from cruise ships, hydrographic offices, even weekend boaters with a decent sounder. By itself, a single ship would need 200 years to map the rest of the uncharted seas. However, “sharing data is a little taboo”, says Tinah Voahangy Martin, a member of Ferrini’s staff who often approaches institutions located on the Indian Ocean to ask for seafloor information. Seafloor data is often considered proprietary, classified or simply too valuable to give away. “You don’t want to be the person who comes in and says ‘Hi, you do this and we expect this. ’ You take them on as a partner. That’s the best way to get them involved. Ferrini adds that, because science in the US is often taxpayer-funded, it creates the expectation that data will always be freely available. “We have to remind ourselves that the whole world doesn’t work that way, and figure out how we can make it mutually beneficial. Nevertheless, at their rate of progress, the finish line of 2030 seems possible. But completing the map on Ferrini’s wall is just the beginning. “There’s still so much more for us to do and know than the shape of the seafloor,” she says. “This is just one piece of a much bigger picture.</data>

			<data> are a strange sight to behold. At their sold-out show at London’s near-5,000 capacity O2 Academy Brixton last December, guitarist Mark Speer and bassist Laura Lee, dressed in long, black, heavily fringed wigs, sway in unison, while bald drummer DJ Johnson sits calmly in his poncho, pensively holding the groove. All three sing amorphous vowel sounds over Speer’s downtempo, wailing guitar melodies while the crowd of teens, jobbing musicians and parents savouring a night out howl along to the strings, trying to keep up with their electric range. Formed in 2013 in Houston, Texas, Khruangbin have come a long way from their origins playing in the band of the same church that Beyoncé used to attend. With only the backing of the indie label Night Time Stories, the group have built a sizeable following who have kept them on the road almost continually for the past four years, a singalong crowd dedicated to the blend of easygoing funk, Tex-Mex and touches of west African rhythm they have showcased over two albums. They count Jay-Z among their fans, have 3. 9m monthly listens on Spotify and were set to headline London’s 20,000-capacity Cross the Tracks festival this month. All this with a band name (meaning “airplane” in Thai) that most of their fans struggle to pronounce. On the face of it, the band’s crossover success is as peculiar as their stage presence. “When you see us play, it should look like we just fell on to this planet,” Speer says from Oakland, California. “We play Earth music, like we’ve listened to all these different genres – from west African rhythms to Mexican and south Asian melodies – and now here we are. ” This unpredictable blend of sounds has led to a slew of miscategorisations when it comes to the band’s output; it’s regularly referred to as either “Thai funk”, “classic soul” or “psychedelia”. For Speer, their “Earth music” is an amalgamation of cultures filtered through their own Texan lens; a recapitulation of the contentious othering of “world” music. “When you normalise English-language music in the west and decide to call everything else ‘world’, belittling it in the process, that’s fucked up,” he says. “There’s so much other music out there, of all languages, that needs to be appreciated and it’s why we try to make our own output as universal as possible. , for instance, or the “yes, this is the third room” refrain on 2018’s Evan Finds the Third Room) that are sung by all three members in unison. “We all sing together in the band, so our lyrics need to resonate with all of us and with the audience, too,” says Laura Lee, with her wig on, over a video link from Miami. “It makes sense to me that we’ve grown such success internationally since our instrumental music largely tries to avoid language barriers and we’re just inviting people to have an emotional connection with the music on their own level. Some might see this anything-goes attitude to music as a form of cultural appropriation, yet Speer justifies it by virtue of their living in Houston. “There’s such diversity here, from west African to south-east Asian, Mexican and Caribbean communities, it’s impossible to ignore how their music makes up the identity of Houston,” he says. “That all feeds inevitably into what we make. and a collaborative EP with Texan soul singer Leon Bridges earlier this year, the band have taken a new approach to recording and writing. After a gruelling 10-week tour featuring daily plane travel, Lee had something of a revelation. “What I hadn’t realised is that touring was the drug, not any of the partying that might come with it,” she says. “Touring is its own escapism and you get addicted to the rush. But in the process of doing that, I lost myself. We live in costumes on stage and I lost touch with the Laura Lee that exists when the lights go down and the wig comes off. From left: DJ Johnson, Laura Lee and Mark Speer. In a rare break from being on the road, she went on a hike to a waterfall with a new friend, Mordechai, and dived in. “That jump really did something for me: I realised that we had all been swimming deep underwater without breathing and without really knowing where we were going for the past few years, just chasing every opportunity instead,” she says. “I had to stop to ask what’s important to me and why. ” She spent the following day in self-imposed silence in Houston, writing stories based on her experiences in the group and her family’s history that would form the basis of the band’s new record, named after that new friend who brought about this transformative experience: Mordechai. The album is a typically transporting Khruangbin listen: 10 tracks filled with reverb-heavy guitar, rumbling dubby basslines and that ever-present compressed groove, yet there is also a marked change in the presence of lyrics. to the repeated question “Where are you now? ”, directed at Lee’s grandfather, on Dearest Alfred. It is a more personal venture for a band usually so shrouded in costume and presentation. is the perfect anxiety-busting album for our frantic times. “We record in a barn out on a remote Houston farm, which has played a big part in our sound,” says drummer Johnson. “The serenity of having nature surround us means it doesn’t make sense for us to then be playing hard and fast. We don’t want to take up all the sonic room when you can hear birds and bees outside; there should be space for that, too. Forced to pause their touring schedule in support of the new record, each member is isolating apart and getting their head round not permanently being in each other’s company. “Four years flew by on tour and I missed four years’ worth of weddings, birthdays and babies being born,” says Lee. “But I also created an incredible family in the process with Mark and DJ, so I feel very grateful for that. Maybe now I can make time for my other families and friends, too. The break has helped shed a new light not only on the band’s career but on the larger, mystical questions of life. “The whole experience of making this album has just helped me focus on the process rather than the results,” she says. “Life is the journey and death is the destination, so we shouldn’t be in such a rush to get there.</data>

			<url>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/south-pole-warming-three-times-faster-than-rest-of-the-world-our-research-shows</url>
			<data> shows a dramatic change. Over the past 30 years, the south pole has been one of the fastest-changing places on Earth, warming more than three times more rapidly than the rest of the world. My colleagues and I argue these warming trends are unlikely the result of natural climate variability alone. Together they make the south pole warming one of the strongest warming trends on Earth. The Amundsen-Scott South Pole station is the Earth’s southern-most weather observatory. The south pole lies within the coldest region on Earth: the Antarctic plateau. Average temperatures range from -60℃ during winter to just -20℃ during summer. Antarctica’s climate generally has a huge range in temperature over the course of a year, with strong regional contrasts. Scientists have been tracking temperature at the Amundsen-Scott south pole Station, Earth’s southernmost weather observatory, since 1957. It is one of the longest-running complete temperature records on the Antarctic continent. Our analysis of weather station data from the south pole shows it has warmed by 1. 8℃ between 1989 and 2018, changing more rapidly since the start of the 2000s. suddenly stopped and the Antarctic Peninsula began cooling. One of the reasons for the south pole warming was stronger low-pressure systems and stormier weather east of the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. With clockwise flow around the low-pressure systems, this has been transporting warm, moist air on to the Antarctic plateau. also shows the ocean in the western tropical Pacific started warming rapidly at the same time as the south pole. We found nearly 20% of the year-to-year temperature variations at the south pole were linked to ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific, and several of the warmest years at the south pole in the past two decades happened when the western tropical Pacific ocean was also unusually warm. This results in a stronger low-pressure system in the Weddell Sea. Map of the Antarctic continent. that strong regional variations in temperature trends are partly due to Antarctica’s shape. , bordered by the South Atlantic and Indian oceans, extends further north than the West Antarctic ice sheet, in the South Pacific. This causes two distinctly different weather patterns with different climate impacts. More steady, westerly winds around East Antarctica keep the local climate relatively stable, while frequent intense storms in the high-latitude South Pacific transport warm, moist air to parts of West Antarctica. Scientists have suggested these two different weather patterns, and the mechanisms driving their variability, are the likely reason for strong regional variability in Antarctica’s temperature trends. Our analysis reveals extreme variations in south pole temperatures can be explained in part by natural tropical variability. To estimate the influence of human-induced climate change, we analysed more than 200 climate model simulations with observed greenhouse gas concentrations over the period between 1989 and 2018. These climate models show recent increases in greenhouse gases have possibly contributed around 1℃ of the total 1. 8℃ of warming at the south pole. We also used the models to compare the recent warming rate to all possible 30-year south pole temperature trends that would occur naturally without human influence. The observed warming exceeds 99. 9% of all possible trends without human influence – and this means the recent warming is extremely unlikely under natural conditions, albeit not impossible. It appears the effects from tropical variability have worked together with increasing greenhouse gases, and the end result is one of the strongest warming trends on the planet. The temperature variability at the South Pole is so extreme it masks anthropogenic effects. These climate model simulations reveal the remarkable nature of south pole temperature variations. The observed south pole temperature, with measurements dating back to 1957, shows 30-year temperature swings ranging from more than 1℃ of cooling during the 20th century to more than 1. 8℃ of warming in the past 30 years. This means multi-decadal temperature swings are three times stronger than the estimated warming from human-caused climate change of around 1℃. The temperature variability at the south pole is so extreme it currently masks human-caused effects. The Antarctic interior is one of the few places left on Earth where human-caused warming cannot be precisely determined, which means it is a challenge to say whether, or for how long, the warming will continue. But our study reveals extreme and abrupt climate shifts are part of the climate of Antarctica’s interior. These will likely continue into the future, working to either hide human-induced warming or intensify it when natural warming processes and the human greenhouse effect work in tandem.</data>

			<data> t was a gift for me when I got anxiety,” Liam Plunkett says calmly as if he is talking about a birthday present rather than the moment when he began to confront the stress and uncertainty which once plagued him. “If I didn’t get anxiety I probably wouldn’t have played in the World Cup. Many of us define anxiety as a really bad thing – and for lots of people it is – but when I deal with anxiety it helps me massively in other areas of life. On Tuesday it will be a year since Plunkett was recalled to England’s World Cup side after they endured a third defeat in the group stages. England had won the four group matches when Plunkett had played and lost all three when he was excluded. Plunkett took 11 wickets in the tournament, including three in the final. His dismissal of Kane Williamson continued his habit of removing the opposition’s best batsman. Quinton de Kock and Chris Gayle had also fallen to Plunkett in the group stages. All that success did not prevent him from being jettisoned when England picked their first post-World Cup one-day squad. not to have received a call to tell him the news. Plunkett is 35 and, bolstered by his intention to play first-class cricket as long as possible, he is philosophical and interested in examining how he turned his past anxiety into a constructive process. “I was fortunate my anxiety didn’t happen on the cricket pitch in front of 50,000 people. It was always when I was facing a one-to-one situation. I know it affects different people in different ways but, for me, it really became a gift. At the time his panic attacks were distressing. “The first one happened when I was on a flight from Newcastle to Heathrow and then on to the US to see my wife. I had to get off the flight just before they closed the door. All of a sudden you’re sat in the plane and sweating. I really wanted to be with my wife but I couldn’t get over this massive hurdle of staying on that flight. Liam Plunkett celebrates taking the wicket of New Zealand’s Henry Nicholls during last year’s World Cup final at Lord’s. A few years later Plunkett’s anxiety reached a debilitating pitch. “I’d had a few panic attacks but I was in a good place after joining Yorkshire from Durham [in 2013]. I was the fittest I’d ever been. In the winter I got a chance to fly to Adelaide where I’d played 10 years before – club cricket at Adelaide University. I took the first flight fine. I landed in Singapore or Hong Kong and had to get a connection. It felt like I couldn’t take a step into the boarding area. “It’s like an invisible wall. Everything is foggy and I couldn’t get through this wall. It was only that I’d handed my passport in and didn’t have the correct visa which distracted my mind. I managed to get the visa and made the flight. But when I landed at Adelaide I didn’t have the courage to get in a car, or take a taxi to training. His anxiety escalated and he did not leave his room for eight days. I would eat at night, and during the day I’d keep myself locked up. It was pretty frightening because I’d not been through that before. ] and he put me in contact with the PCA [Professional Cricketers’ Association]. “I spoke to someone in Adelaide for a couple of sessions. He helped me. I tried to eat healthy and train smart. I was treating my body with respect and it helped clear my mind. But it’s frightening the first time. I know people who can go spiralling down and it can be fatal for some. But I always know there is a way out. There’re always strategies and people to talk to. Surrey’s Liam Plunkett keeps fit at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Plunkett has learned to control his anxiety. “I’m pretty good now. I know what triggers it and I don’t want to put myself out there within a few days of the trigger. I need time to recover. “As a young cricketer I thought there must be something wrong back home with Tres. You’re like: ‘Oh, that will never happen to me. ’ But I learned anxiety is a tool you should use. I feel overcoming the anxiety has improved me 100% as a cricketer and as a person. It’s like practising in the nets. Why would you not do that for your mind? Plunkett’s resilience has its roots in the strength of his parents. His mother has had cancer three times and his father had both a kidney and a liver transplant. “I appreciate that, mate,” he says when I ask about their health in the current crises. “They’re good and I get my grit from my mum. She goes out for a 14-mile walk and so she’s the fittest she’s been in a long time. Recently I’ve been able to see my mum at a distance and I’m now doing personal training with her. It gives me practice [as a personal trainer]. “They’re incredible people. My old man had cysts that affected his organs. So he had both transplants. But they’re real strong and just cracked on with life. I’ve been a bit like Mum and Dad when I’ve hit roadblocks. I’ve always found a positive. “When I struggled in cricket [with Plunkett’s international career being punctuated by spells in the wilderness] someone said: ‘This doesn’t define you. ’ I was thinking if I don’t perform that makes me a crappy person and they said: ‘You can still be a good husband or brother or son. ’ I thought: ‘I’d rather be a good one of them than a good cricketer. In 2007 he offered his dad one of his kidneys as a potential donor. “He didn’t want none of it,” Plunkett says. “I was playing in the World Cup in the Caribbean and I offered it because he was struggling. But he’s in a decent place now. he has just launched with Chris Peel of The Training Room – a company that educates people through health and fitness. The PRP offers courses in personal training, IT, education and events management to professional sports people so they can forge alternative careers in retirement. “I jumped at the chance,” Plunkett says, “because people in professional sport have such transferable skills. We want to help them think about using those skills to find new career paths. That question of ‘What next? ’ can be a tough one but it can also be exciting. Cricket’s been a massive part of my life the last 16 years. While I’m still performing, and helping win games, I want to play as long as possible. But just because cricket stops one day doesn’t mean you can’t be passionate about another role – like the PRP. Plunkett and his World Cup‑winning teammates enjoyed an all-day session on Zoom while last year’s thrilling final was screened again on television. “It was very cool. I’d recorded my bowling and watched that thousands of times but I’d not watched the full thing. People were coming in and out of the Zoom session all day and we had a couple of beers and a good chat. It was fun to relive that memory together – as a band of brothers who won the World Cup. Not many groups do that. They needed some hard meetings during the tournament when England were on the brink of elimination. “There was a big one at Edgbaston. Everyone got to vent. I wasn’t in the team at that point and I said: ‘I’m pissed off I’m not playing, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want people to do well. ’ I was dropped after performing well but there were lots of games and I accepted it. I said: ‘I’m not going to sit like a moody little kid in the corner. That’s poison for the dressing room. ’ It cleared the air and helped us go in the right direction. The night before the final Plunkett felt “fairly laid-back”. I wanted to enjoy this one. I knew it could be the last chance to play in a World Cup, the last chance to play for England. Do I still think I'm good enough to play for England? “On the day, when I started bowling down the hill as first change, I was a bit nervous and struggled to get my length. But after a few overs I came back from the other end and bowled nicely [taking three for 42]. Even during the super over I wanted the ball to come my way. You could take a blinding catch to win the World Cup. His teammates shared that positivity and, with some good fortune, England became world champions amid excruciating tension. “I was so proud to win with that bunch of boys. Everything was buzzing afterwards in the dressing room. I sat down to take my boots off and that wave of emotion hit me. I started to sob tears of joy. Different emotions, pinned down by disappointment, were felt a few months later when Plunkett discovered on social media he had been dropped. “I think that’s what it is,” he says of the hurt caused by the inexplicable decision not to tell him personally. “I appreciate it’s sport, at the highest level, and new people are always coming in but do I still think I’m good enough to play for England? But that ship has sailed and I’m not a person to hold grudges. I’m trying to get on with the next thing at Surrey. Plunkett has floated the idea of playing for USA in a World Cup, as he and his American wife may settle in the States, but he sounds philosophical. “I want to play for as long as I can for Surrey. Hopefully that’s another three years. Then it’s three years to qualify for the US. I might not even get into their team and I think I’d prefer to develop as a coach. All the ghosts of the anxious past seem a long way away. The future looks a lighter place as Plunkett laughs. “But who knows? ” he says wryly. “I might still be flying in at 42.</data>

			<data> in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. while tripping on LSD. In some ways, Ellis’s performance for the Pirates against San Diego Padres on Friday 12 June 1970 was not exactly a pitching masterclass. Ellis recorded more walks (eight) than strikeouts (six), hit another batsman, allowed three stolen bases, and was bailed out by highlight-reel plays in the field by second baseman Bill Mazeroski and centerfielder Matty Alou. But consider the circumstances: “I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire,” he recounted years later to the New York Times. “And once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. Somehow, after fanning Ed Spiezio on a curveball in the bottom of the ninth, Ellis completed his long, strange trip without surrendering a single hit in a 2-0 victory. For context: it is one of only 303 no-hitters out of the more than 210,000 games played in major league history since 1876. That alone would secure his place in baseball lore. That he did it while tripping balls almost beggars belief. This isn’t a story you will hear on a tour of Cooperstown or in any of a hidebound sport’s official histories. has only released snippets of this game to the public and it’s unclear whether footage of the game in its entirety exists. Yet in time Ellis’ account of his most unusual triumph has entered the realm between fact and myth where baseball’s most indelible legends call home. With a day off on Thursday as the Pirates arrived in San Diego for their first west coast road trip of the season, Ellis decided to make the short journey to his hometown of Los Angeles, since the team didn’t play until Friday night. So he rented a car and dropped a tab of acid, timing it so it would hit right as he arrived at the home of a friend’s girlfriend. “What’s wrong with you? ” she asked upon his arrival. “I’m as high as a Georgia pine,” Ellis said. The old friends caught up over heroic amounts booze and marijuana until Ellis drifted off to sleep. He dropped more acid after waking from what he thought was a catnap, believing it still to be Thursday. , but Ellis was scheduled to pitch. In four hours. In a different city. Ellis’ immediate reaction, as he recalled it: “What happened to yesterday? The time was 2pm. Ellis hopped a taxi to the airport and bought a $9. 50 ticket for a 3. 30pm flight to San Diego, arriving an hour later and making it to the ballpark in time for the 6. 05pm first pitch. “I can only remember bits and pieces of the game,” Ellis recalled in 1984. “I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [catcher’s] glove, but I didn’t hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn’t. “Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving out of the way of a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn’t hit hard and never reached me. Ellis claimed to have pitched every game of his career under the influence of something, whether alcohol or the uppers such as Benzedrine and Dexamyl that were popped in major-league clubhouses like Tic Tacs during the 70s, but he kept the LSD secret close to his chest for years. He first disclosed it in the draft of a 1976 biography he collaborated on with friend Donald Hall, the former Paris Review poetry editor and future US poet laureate, but asked that it be removed from the final manuscript, lest he invite the wrath of George Steinbrenner, the buttoned-down owner of the Yankees, with whom he had just signed. Only after a 1984 interview with Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press did Ellis’s account finally enter the public record, trickling quietly into the zeitgeist of a pre-internet world. Shortly before he died of cirrhosis in 2008, Ellis sat down with NPR’s Donnell Alexander and Neille Ilel for a final interview about the LSD no-no. that posthumously elevated Ellis’ peak performance from urban legend to mainstream yarn. The immensity of Ellis’ psychedelic feat has come to overshadow both the on-field accomplishments and social conscience that marked his 12-year major-league career. When he’d first signed a contract with the Pirates out of high school, it had been less than two decades since Major League Baseball was integrated. The free-thinking Ellis was unafraid to voice his opinions on social injustice and institutionalized racism in a sport that was slow to integrate, becoming a vocal advocate for free agency and equality for players of color. in MLB history. That same year, Ellis started the All-Star Game and was an important member of the Pittsburgh team that defeated the vaunted Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. He joined the Yankees toward the end of his career and was a key starter on a New York team that captured the pennant in 1976, winning the American League’s Comeback Player of the Year award. But it was a drive to do good that was a constant in his life after retirement, when he got sober and worked with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to rehabilitate black prisoners, helped start the Black Athletes Foundation for Sickle Cell Research and served as the coordinator of an anti-drug program in Los Angeles. As he explained to enrollees, he self-medicated to cope with the fear of both losing and winning. He came to bemoan the feat he’s most associated with simply because it “robbed him of his greatest professional memory”. And yet Ellis’s feat does endure as a myth of America’s counterculture era, the sort of signpost that explains baseball’s grip on the national psyche and inimitable way of marking our times. If nothing else, it’s a hell of a story.</data>

			<data> Friends and family of Elijah McClain, a 23-year old Black man who died after being put in a chokehold by police and injected with ketamine by paramedics, have described how he was loved by “everybody who met him” and wanted to “change the world”. McClain was a massage therapist, a keen musician and a runner. , in August as he walked home from a convenience store where he was buying iced teas. Nearly a year after the fatal incident, none of the officers involved have been fired and are yet to face any criminal charges. last week that it had appointed the state attorney general, Phil Weiser, to investigate. The move came after over three million people signed a petition calling for justice for McClain. On Saturday, thousands of people attended a peaceful protest in Aurora that included a violin vigil in memory of McClain, who taught himself to play the instrument. in riot gear who deployed pepper spray against the demonstrators. “And it’s crazy, because he ended up doing it anyway. The civil rights attorney Mari Newman, who is representing the McClain family, told the Guardian McClain was loved by “everybody who met him”. Since his death, she has been inundated with emails and calls from people who knew him – ranging from a client with a debilitating back injury to a bus driver with whom he was on a first name basis. “Elijah danced to the beat of his own drum. He was a unique human being who brought light and joy everywhere he went, according to everybody who interacted with him,” she said. She added: “One of his signatures is he would give a gratitude bow when he came into a room and when he left a room, and we can see a couple of videos of that, including the video from the convenience store where he bought the iced tea very shortly before he was killed. What does it mean to defund the police? McClain, who had five siblings and was raised by his mother in Aurora, lived in an apartment with his cousin near where he was killed. His mother, who homeschooled him for a period of time, noticed he was smart, studious and independent from an early age. As a teenager he taught himself guitar and violin and, after graduating technical college in Denver, got a job as a massage therapist. His sister Samara said he was planning to go to college and get a degree. He was a vegetarian and known as a peaceful person. “He didn’t argue with anybody. If you tried to argue with him he would just say ‘I love you’ and walk away. Friends and colleagues this week told the Guardian that McClain – who was also known as Eli - changed their lives on a daily basis. His colleagues at Massage Envy said he followed the motto “always with gratitude” and would often draw pictures for colleagues, perform headstands in the corridors and would always wear barefoot running-style “toe shoes” so he could feel closer to the ground. As well as being a talented masseuse, he was also known for the kind way he treated colleagues, regularly singing and dancing, and for regular trips to a local pet shop where he would play a violin for kittens who did not have homes. Madison Freeman, 24, a receptionist at Massage Envy, who worked with McClain for just over a year, said: “It was almost like he walked with a gold orb around him. “He just wanted to be better every day. And when he wasn’t down playing guitar or violin for the baby kittens, he was running, exercising outside … He was always fully booked and it was a massage that you couldn’t get again. Just his energy and his spirit, it just put you in a better mood. He truly was just a healer. Freeman, who said he inspired her to also become a vegetarian, said she once found him running through the lobby “like a cheetah”. The Colorado state representative Leslie Herod, left, hugs Elijah McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, right, as they stand with protestors on 27 June. “He was just a funny guy. He was always just trying to make people laugh and always just trying to help people see the good in life. James Vigil, 33, a massage therapist who worked with McClain for three years, said he was “the kind of person that you could be having a bad day, look at them smile and change your day around”. He added: “He was so peaceful, you couldn’t stay mad at him. He was just an angel, an earthly angel. He would do anything to help out anybody and he would do anything to better his life. He was constantly trying to learn and grow his knowledge. He was inspired by everything and that inspired me. He described how once he insisted on rescuing a fly after colleagues tried to kill it. “He trapped it in the cup real quick and he released it outside. He came back in and said, ‘You know, every life matters. Eric Behrens, 32, who became friends with McClain after working with him said they talked about music together and played Playstation. “I know it sounds weird, but even his gamer tag was a perfect example of who he was. A gamer tag … was ‘Purposely guided’. I felt like he lived like that. He said his music tastes were eclectic. “We talked a lot about jazz and blues and metal – although he wasn’t necessarily fond of some of the heavier stuff that I was into. But again, he was generally an open-minded kid. The former massage therapist Emerald Bixby, 31, who used to work with McClain at Massage Envy, said he was a “one-of-a-kind eccentric”. She added that he “so naturally marched to his own drum that he didn’t even really understand how unique he was for doing it, because he didn’t have to try”.</data>

			<url>https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jun/30/cps-secretly-dropped-weak-cases-say-rights-groups</url>
			<data> , documents shared with the Guardian reveal. The details have emerged in papers that are to be submitted to an ongoing government review of how rape is treated throughout the criminal justice system. They include statements from dozens of rape victims whose cases were not prosecuted and an account by a CPS whistleblower. Reported rapes have increased steadily over the past decade and more than 58,000 were recorded by police in England and Wales in 2018/19. The decline is a key area of inquiry in the review. (EVAW), a coalition of women’s groups, and passed to justice secretary Robert Buckland, chair of the Criminal Justice Board that established the review. In an unusual move, EVAW will publish the documents ahead of a fresh legal challenge against the CPS. The group will mount an appeal over whether the prosecution service adopted a secret policy in rape investigations to drop supposedly “weak” cases in order to boost conviction rates. Whistleblower testimony, which is included in the documents published today, details how CPS prosecutors were allegedly given guidance at training workshops on how to meet conviction targets with “the removal of hundreds of ‘weak’ cases from the criminal justice system which are less likely to find favour with a jury”. the guidance had led to a risk-averse approach to the prosecution of rape, where myths and stereotypes could lead prosecutors to drop cases. The dossier of rape cases where the CPS reportedly declined to bring charges includes one case where the CPS gave the fact that the survivor had “enjoyed an adventurous sex life” as a reason not to charge. the EVAW coalition permission to pursue their case to go to a full hearing. The court of appeal has now agreed to hear an appeal against that decision. Why has the charge rate for rape fallen in England and Wales? The charge or summons rate for rape fell to one in 65, or 1. . The figure has dropped steeply since 2015-16, when one in seven, or 13. 7%, of all cases resulted in a charge or summons. concluded the service was not to blame for a precipitous drop in rape charges, but that the system – and in particular police-led investigations – was under-resourced to “breaking point”. against the CPS in September 2019. Rape is a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute primarily because it comes down to the question of consent, often in a situation where there are only two people. In these cases evidence beyond the word of the victim or defendant is seen as central to building a strong case. Digital evidence requested from complainants, such as data, location information and texts from phones, is time-consuming to investigate. In 2018, more than half of all rape cases took more than 100 days to assign an outcome. A charge or summons is one of the steps in proceeding to a trial. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. At issue is whether the CPS adopted a substantive policy, not acknowledged publicly, in late 2016 to adopt a target of 60% of charged cases resulting in a conviction or if, as the CPS claims, its internal refresher training sessions for prosecutors were merely a “gentle touch on the tiller”. EVAW alleges that the “merits-based” approach of pursuing all cases where there is credible evidence has been replaced by a “bookmaker’s test” approach where they guess the probability of a jury convicting on the evidence and become reluctant to press ahead with more difficult rape cases. In the hearing this March, counsel for the CPS denied that there had been a change in policy, stating that: “The fall of conviction rates is due to a far wider range of factors involving the police that are now the subject of a government review. There has been a “precipitous drop” in prosecution rates for rape, falling to their lowest level in a decade despite a sharp increase in the number of cases being reported to police. A review of the latest CPS charging statistics included in the evidence submitted show only one in three rape cases resulted in a charge between April and September 2018. from Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI), have blamed the steep decline on lack of police and CPS resources due to austerity cuts as well as the massive increase in workload involved in most cases due to the availability of digital downloads from complainants’ and defendants’ mobile phones. The collapse of a series of rape cases in 2017 also raised concerns about whether sufficient effort was being put into disclosure of crucial evidence – further adding to the burdens on officers and prosecutors. The documents released online on Tuesday are part of the claim submitted to the court in March. Because that hearing was halted at the preliminary, permission stage much of it has not been widely publicised. Sue Hemming, CPS director of legal services, said: “We share the concerns about the gap between reported rapes and those cases which come to court. However, the judgment of the High Court was clear: there has been no change of approach in how CPS prosecutes rape. They found that there was no arguable basis for EVAW’s claims. “The independent inspectorate report on rape found the same, concluding our legal test was correctly applied in 98% of cases they examined. “We are focused on understanding the charging gap and will shortly announce further plans to help secure justice for everybody affected by sexual violence. to carry out effective investigations into victims of the serial sex attacker John Worboys. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said it has committed to publishing an action plan in relation to the end-to-end review this year and it will respond to the letter in due course.</data>

			<data> y the time the mercurial, volatile singer-songwriter John Martyn heard that he had been awarded an OBE for his contribution to British music, he was in a wheelchair, having lost a leg to septicaemia compounded by a lifetime of substance abuse. Musicians often embody a garble of contradictions, but the English-born “Scots Belgian Jew” known to his family as Iain McGeachy was a more troubled – and troubling – figure than many from the late-60s. A trailblazing guitarist, he began his artistic life in the crucible of the folk revival that also produced Fairport Convention and Nick Drake. , one of Martyn’s most magnificent outings, was written about Drake. U2 guitarist the Edge may not formally concur, but Martyn fans know the Irishman’s signature guitar sound was cribbed from Martyn. and Bob Marley were admirers, as were Portishead. By the end, Martyn had been impaled on a fence post and run into a cow with his car; artistically, he was yesterday’s man, having spent the 80s making slicker, more suffocatingly produced commercial rock music, often in the company of Phil Collins. There were periods when this leading light of the maverick fringe went dark, presumably to avoid the disreputable characters with whom he surrounded himself. The searching artistry of this caustic musician’s musician went hand in glove with dissolution and damage. , dives straight into the awfulness of the man in the preface. “He blackened the eyes and broke the spirit of women he professed to love, abandoned at least one of his children and neglected others. Martyn’s parents separated when he was young, with his mother remarrying; the young Martyn felt the enforced distance from his mother, Betty, keenly. “He mistrusted women, which turned him into a misogynist,” states the folk singer Beverley Martyn, who suffered his violent alcoholic rages. When the marriage broke up, Martyn left her, their two biological children and Beverley’s eldest child penniless; they lived off benefits while Martyn fuelled a coke habit. He started another family, forsook them too. Listen to John Martyn’s Solid Air. Somehow, this man had the gall to sing about love. Perhaps his best-known early song, May You Never, is an open-hearted blessing: “may you never lay your head down without a hand to hold”. The remainder of the song’s lyrics touch on telling concerns, though. “May you never lose your temper if you get in a bar room fight,” Martyn husks. He saw many himself. According to his long-time musical wingman and carousing pal, the celebrated bassist Danny Thompson, Martyn once butted two men of a party of 12 after one racially abused a waiter in an Indian restaurant; the rest backed down. Tellingly, the well-wishing of May You Never reads, for the bulk of the song, like a dose of toxic masculinity garbed in lambswool; the verses double as a litany of paranoid fears of being badmouthed or backstabbed. And yet Martyn, the difficult musical visionary, thoroughly deserves this painstaking and eloquent biography. It is not the first, but balances the fan’s assiduousness with a critic’s sieving action. Thomson does the legwork: the leading lights of the folk-rock scene, Martyn’s teenage girlfriend, Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, an early and loyal benefactor, Martyn’s children, umpteen band members, session musicians, producers and former managers are interviewed. One anonymous friend of Martyn’s is still too scared to go on the record about the musician’s underworld connections. It would no doubt incense the scathing, unclubbable Martyn to learn how many of his peers-cum-rivals (Richard Thompson, for one) come to pass judgment on his abilities and frailties. What emerges is a picture of a one-man band musician whose virtuoso playing and jigsaw of effects units could, legend has it, upstage superstars; a charming boor with quicksilver in his fingers. by Graeme Thomson is published by Omnibus (£20).</data>

			<url>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/28/the-cinema-is-my-solace-in-times-of-crisis</url>
			<data> s a writer who works from home, my lockdown life has not been so different from my previous existence. Perhaps the biggest change is that I have not gone three months without visiting a cinema since I was a child. It seems a shameful thing to admit when others have been suffering so profoundly, but I have missed those movies on the big screen. They have been my lifelong companions, and I have lamented them like vanished friends. My yearning to see it was elemental: my dad was taking my older brother and I wanted everything he got. When it was broken to me that at three years old I was too young to go to the cinema, I screamed for days, thus confirming that I indeed could not yet be trusted anywhere near one. and I climbed into my red velvet seat like it was a birthright throne. And everything was perfect, right up until the film opened with the Evil Queen interrogating her creepy mirror. I screamed until Mum agreed we could leave. This movie opened not with a murderous witch, but a luminous actress leading a Shanghai chorus-line, a slapstick brawl that included a murder by flaming kebab skewer, and a desperate flight over the Himalayas. By the time our heroes sat down to the Maharajah’s banquet of chilled monkey brains and eyeball soup, I was having the time of my life. A movie is a comfort blanket. But then a boy’s heart was ripped from his chest and he was sacrificed in a pool of lava. I screwed my eyes shut and kept them like that until the house lights came up. At home I told my grandmother what I had witnessed, and asked her if it had really happened like that? Grandma furrowed her brow. Had the boy’s heart been visibly beating when it was removed, she asked? And had I seen him fully submerged in the lava? My grandmother told me not to worry: the boy had been a professional stunt child and his parents would have been generously reimbursed for their loss. No doubt Grandma thought I’d understand her joke, but for years thereafter I refused to cross the threshold of a cinema lest I witness another snuff movie. Instead, I watched movies at home on our new VCR. I could fast-forward through the scary parts and if it looked like they were preparing to dispatch another stunt child, I could banish the tape to the cupboard under the stairs. , 1988’s seminal paean to growing up. , 12-year-old Josh Baskin is turned away from a roller-coaster for being too short. Dismayed, he heads to a nearby machine that features a mechanical mystic called Zoltar, drops a coin in his mouth, and wishes that he was big. The next morning, Josh wakes up to find himself trapped in the body of a thirtysomething Tom Hanks. had it all – a story, hilarity, heartfelt emotion and a bucket full of bittersweets – and it seared itself into my mind. Sometimes it goes the other way and life steals from the movies. Not long after I awoke to find myself inexplicably thirtysomething, I happened upon a Zoltar machine in San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf. I dropped my coin and made my wish. , I found myself grateful anew for it. had stayed with me for so long in part because it had made me – and the rest of its audience – truly feel Josh’s highs and lows. All the best movies perform this alchemy of rendering the specific universal, but even bad movies can still hit surprisingly hard if something in them speaks directly to us. When I was Josh Baskin’s age, I changed schools, my parents divorced and I experienced a feeling I would later come to know as loneliness. , a screwball caper in which Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn play ex-lovers reunited years after he mysteriously disappeared. As the movie reaches its zenith, Mel Gibson finally reveals the reason for his disappearance: he entered the witness protection programme to protect Goldie Hawn from the villains who would otherwise have killed her. is a terrible movie, and my dad had left for more ordinary reasons than joining the witness protection programme, but that day Mum and I departed the cinema feeling restored. If ever I argued that point to you, please consider this my apology. marked the first time I understood a movie could be a comfort blanket, but they have remained so ever since. I am hardly unique in this, so what is it about movies that can provide us with solace in difficult times? it’s time for popcorn in the dark. That first line doesn’t hold up, of course, but the second line hints at the quiet comfort a trip to the movies can bring. There is something oddly reassuring about sitting among strangers in the dark and watching as other strangers pretend to be yet other strangers still. my brother died and it felt like somebody had reached into my chest and ripped out my own beating heart. For weeks I quarantined myself at home, as if my sadness was a contagion I must not spread. Halfway through the movie, I realised I was not just smiling for the first time in more than a month. I was laughing. At times of trouble now, my first instinct is to go to the movies. A couple of years ago, Mum fell seriously ill. At evening visiting, I would stay until the nurse rang the bell and then on my way home I would turn off from the city bypass at the multiplex. I never bothered to look up what was on, because the movie itself was never the point. The popcorn in the dark was the point. As Mum recovered she wanted her own first outing to be to the movies. , an articulated lorry on a perpetual tour of the Highlands that unfolds into a cinema. Most of the village came out for opening night and everybody was excited to see the movie, but even more excited to see my newly recovered mother. : Freddie Mercury and also my mum. That does not happen when you stream movies at home. But then came coronavirus. The cinemas closed their doors and I have had to seek my solace elsewhere. Here in Los Angeles, the quietest days of lockdown saw me exploring new bicycle routes on hitherto deadly streets. Often I found myself riding down a near empty Hollywood Boulevard: the tourist shops shuttered, the abandoned sidewalk stars even more absurd than usual, and only an occasional costumed superhero loitering forlornly outside the subway. They were scenes from an apocalyptic movie, of course, but as I rode I kept an eye out for something from another kind of film. Because a deserted Hollywood Boulevard during a pandemic seemed exactly the kind of end-of-the-pier place where one might happen upon a working Zoltar machine. And then I will aim another coin and make a second wish: that our cinemas soon reopen, and we can once more sit amidst strangers and forget our problems for a couple of hours.

			<data> his exceptionally delicious plate of pasta shows how, with heat and a little time, ingredients can be transformed. Use the best, sweetest tomatoes you can find (if in doubt, use cherry tomatoes) and see how their flavour develops after spending time in a pan alongside olive oil and garlic. A bowl of comforting sustenance for those nights when you have little energy to cook. The crunchy crumb provides brilliant sparks of flavour to accent the gently acidic, sweet tomato sauce. Warm the oil in a pan over a medium heat and gently fry the sliced garlic until it starts to colour at the edges. Add the tomatoes, season well and leave to simmer briskly for 20-25 minutes, adding a little water if it threatens to catch at the bottom of the pan. Meanwhile, make the breadcrumbs. Warm the oil and the whole, peeled garlic cloves in a small frying pan over a low heat. After about five minutes, the garlic should be golden and soft and the oil should smell fragrant. Add the chilli flakes, cook for another minute, then turn the heat up to medium and add the breadcrumbs. Season generously, and fry, stirring all the while, for several minutes, until golden and crisp. Remove from the heat and add the lemon zest. Check the seasoning and set aside (you can leave the garlic in or take it out – whichever you prefer). Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the beans for three to four minutes, or until tender. Scoop the beans out of the pan with a slotted spoon and drop them straight into the tomato sauce. Bring the water back up to a boil, then add the spaghetti. Whilethe spaghetti is cooking, stir the beans into the sauce, still over the heat, adding a ladleful of pasta water to loosen the sauce. Once the pasta is cooked to al dente, drain through a sieve, keeping a cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the beans and stir well. Set aside for a few minutes, then stir again, adding a few splashes of cooking water, again to loosen the sauce. Shred or rip the basil leaves into the sauce, transfer to heated plates and scatter over the breadcrumbs. Drizzle over the last tablespoon of oil and serve at once. – blitz old bread into crumbs, leave it to dry, then store in sealed jars and fry whenever you want to add a delicious crunch to grilled vegetables, pasta or a gratin.</data>

			<data> few days after we bought our cooker, a book arrived in the post. The cooker was a secondhand Gasfire Cucina – identified by the man who came to service and fit it (a 40-minute job that cost twice the price of the cooker) as one of the last to be made entirely by hand before the factory was mechanised in the late 1960s. , Sophia Loren’s first cookbook; a surprise gift from a woman called Cathy Whims, whom I’d met at a lunch. A cooker and a cookbook: the two were already related. They were also both beautiful, singleminded, previously owned, smelled vaguely of well-done toast, and both special (one handmade, the other first-edition). Add to all that the proximity of their arrival and the fact that the book was first published the year I was born. Also, that Sophia, too, had a Gasfire cooker, larger than mine, with hub-cap-like vents and two ovens, and that features in three of the book’s eight colour plates so saturated with colour and flair, they seem to glow and throb. It is my habit to look for messages – in clouds, coincidences, song lyrics, the condensation on train windows – a habit that verges on superstition at times. But there was no doubting that there was significance in it all, and that Sophia, her chin resting in her hand, her elbow resting on a table heaped with vegetables and dry spaghetti threatening to slide off, was glowing and speaking directly to me. ‘I never imagined I would be so dedicated to pasta, but putting on the water for it marks the middle or end of our every day. section in her book, some of which I don’t agree with – so I share my own pasta rules with you here. You need a large pot with plenty of water, so that each sprig of pasta can cook separately, free to move in the water without clustering. I never imagined I would be so dedicated to pasta, but I am, and putting on the water for it marks the middle or end of our every day. I have a lightweight pan that holds six litres, but as I am usually cooking 400g dried pasta, I fill it with four litres (one litre for every 100g pasta). Add salt (10g for every litre) when the water is boiling – this will increase the violence of the boiling. Turn the flame even higher to compensate for the fall in temperature when you add the pasta. As you add the pasta, stir to spread it out. Keep a careful eye and pay more attention to tasting than to the manufacturer’s timings; taste and taste – it should be firm, but not raw. This is where is Sophia and I disagree – disagreement being a fundamental tenet of home cooking. She suggests adding oil to the cooking water to make the pasta more “mobile” when adding sauce; I keep back the starchy pasta cooking water, which I then add back to the dish if it needs loosening. Again, I disagree with Sophia here, because it depends on the dish. can be a bonus. Courgette pesto, for example, a vivid green, pounded sauce that owes everything to classic basil, pine nut, garlic, olive oil and pecorino, but replaces some of the basil with grated courgette and some of the (fiendishly expensive) pine nuts with almonds. Pasta dripping with starchy cooking water (helped by the addition of a diced potato) is required for the dish to have a soft swish, and to curl it around a fork. in which the pasta is layered with an olive-oil-rich cooked tomato sauce and a raw one; also gratings of salty cheese – well-drained pasta is key. : waste no time in mixing the pasta and the sauce and bringing it to the table, steaming hot. Use the rest of the pasta cooking water to do the washing up – and to wipe the red or green splatters from the cooker, but not the book. Bring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta. Wash, top and tail the courgettes, then, using the coarse side of a box grater, grate into a clean tea towel and squeeze all the excess water out. In a blender or mortar, blitz or pound the nuts, garlic and a pinch of salt until the mix resembles a coarse rubble. Add the courgette, basil and oil, and blitz or pound again, until you have a rough, vivid-green paste. Scrape into a large bowl, stir in the cheese and taste for salt. Salt the boiling water and cook the pasta, adding the diced potato, too, until the pasta is cooked but still has some bite. Drain the pasta (saving some of the cooking water) and combine with the pesto. Swirl it around, and add more pasta cooking water to achieve a soft, swishy texture. (double tomato sauce with penne). First, make the cooked sauce. Peel the fresh tomatoes by plunging them into a pan of boiling water (save the water to cook the pasta later) for one minute and lift out into cold water, at which point the skins should slip away. Roughly chop, discarding any hard bits. In a large, deep frying pan, heat six to eight tablespoons of olive oil and fry the garlic for a few minutes. Add the chopped fresh and tinned tomatoes, a pinch of dried red chilli and a pinch of oregano, and simmer for 20 minutes, pressing the tomatoes with the back a wooden spoon or potato masher, until rich, saucy and to your liking. Pull from the heat. For the raw sauce, quarter (or eighth, if they are big) the fresh tomatoes over a bowl to catch the juices, add a good pinch of salt, four tablespoons of olive oil and lots of ripped basil, and leave to sit while you cook the pasta. Bring the pan of water back to a boil, add salt, stir, then add the pasta, cook until al dente, then drain. Spread a little cooked sauce in the base of a shallow bowl, add a layer of hot pasta, then some uncooked sauce, a grating of ricotta … Continue layering like this until all the ingredients are mixed, ending with cheese and some basil leaves.</data>

She wrote about the event on her blog, and her post went viral. and sometimes even deadly stunts. Karvunidis now considers the parties problematic, partly because they’ve gotten so out of hand, but also because of the message they send. “Who cares what gender the baby is? in a Facebook post in 2019. Her post again went viral, alongside a photo of her family featuring her daughter wearing a pale blue blazer and pants. “The world’s first gender-reveal party baby is a girl who wears suits! She spoke to the Guardian about the trend she unwittingly started, and its limitations. I was certainly not anticipating creating an entire identity for my child. I was just looking for a way to up the ante and get everyone excited and involved. And I have a flair for theatrics and love to throw parties – we had a party for the goldfish once. We have a blowout for the dog every year. I just kind of invented an occasion out of it. It was maybe a year or so later that I started seeing people I didn’t know having parties kind of copying mine with gender reveal cakes. It was really weird to me. I kept thinking maybe someone did one before me but NPR did this whole exhaustive thing and got to the bottom of it. When I first saw that a gender-reveal party had caused a forest fire I cried because I felt responsible. But here’s the thing – when planes crash no one goes after the Wright brothers. I think the parties probably would have happened anyway. I put form to it, but it’s not that crazy of an idea. Now I think the whole thing is not great at all, though. The problem is they overemphasize one aspect of a person. I had two more kids after Bianca, but I never had another gender reveal party. Secretly, when I was pregnant with Bianca, I wanted a girl. But it wasn’t that I wanted to dress her up in tutus. The nursery was blue and yellow. The playroom was all primary colors. For her first birthday we put her in a black blazer. Maybe I could just feel who she was. But my thinking about gender really changed with my second daughter, who’s pretty girly. On Christmas morning when she was three, she opened up a set of Legos in primary colors and started crying. She said, “Santa Claus brought me a boy toy. ” – she thought because they weren’t pink they weren’t for her. That’s when I was like, “You know what? Something has to change. ” There’s such an obsession with gender that it becomes limiting in many ways and exploitative in others. You don’t want what’s between your legs to guide your path in life. I want my kids to grow up in a world where gender doesn’t matter. The Karvunidis family portrait from 2018. Now I just try to cater each child. The middle one loves dolls so she has 100 dolls. Whereas Bianca rocks her suits. She is the most confident 11-year-old you’ll ever meet. The way that started is that it was time to get dressed up for our family Christmas pictures a few years ago and Bianca had been saying for a while that she didn’t want to wear dresses. What do you think about a suit? ” We both looked at each other and she said, “Can girls wear suits? Let’s get you one. ” That’s the photo that ended up going viral. I get a lot of emails from transgender or non-binary teenagers who see themselves in Bianca. And they see her family supporting her. This one girl told me she wanted to wear a suit to Easter and her mother said she couldn’t live in the house if she was going to dress like that. I was horrified. My parents threw me out when I was 17 years old. It wasn’t about gender or sexuality, but I know how it feels to be a teenager who’s not loved or accepted. I absolutely would not tolerate it. I mean, we have rules – she has to have lights out at 9pm – but my child is welcomed for all of her personality. Whatever flavor we get, we’re happy with. Bianca’s pronouns are she/her, but you might be surprised how many girls might wind up in suits if they were allowed to do whatever the hell they wanted.</data>

			<data> ockdown has been hard for rodents whose fortunes are tied to those of humans. When restaurants closed, and city streets and back alleys emptied of people and their waste, rats lost a plentiful supply of food. So they followed us home, foraging and breeding in our gardens, drains and household voids. They became more brazen and aggressive. And, when that wasn’t enough, they began to eat each other. Cannibal rats are among the grimmest consequences of the upending of urban life. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned of “unusual or aggressive” behaviour in rats, including the eating of rat pups. This probably shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that cannibalism is common among mammals in extremis. “Mothers will eat their young in the hope of one day being able to reproduce again,” says Steve Belmain, a professor of ecology at the Natural Resources Institute in Kent, and the UK’s leading rat academic. “If there’s not enough food to take care of herself, she won’t kill herself looking after them. in 1968 that malnutrition in rodents can produce a “perversion” in the dam, or mother. “This will lead her, as well as other adult or growing animals in the cage, to devour carcasses, and even to attack and kill the young in order to eat them. Even more horrifyingly to human ears, cannibalism, Lane-Petter went on, “may develop as a vice. Whisker-eating in mice is not uncommon; it can go on to ear- or toe-chewing, and, from there to total cannibalism. Cannibalism aside, Britain’s pest control firms have reported a surge in demand. Rentokil has noted an almost 80% increase in visits to its website compared with this time last year. The company said the warm winter kept rat populations high, adding to the pressure on the animals. Meanwhile, our homes are offering richer pickings because we are eating in and gardening more. “We’ve noticed more activity around compost bins, as people in lockdown are composting far more,” says Paul Bates of Cleankill, a Croydon firm whose domestic rat call-outs are up 20% compared with last year. With daily replenishment and no limit on consumption, an unsecured vegetable waste bin is a Pizza Hut salad buffet for a rat. Bates says rats have become bolder in attempting to enter our homes, competing with the mice that are our more common housemates. Rats crawl up drains and gnaw through plastic piping. They can swim into toilet bowls. “Customers have all commented on how much braver and more brazen the rats have become,” says Nick Woodroffe of Peak Pest Control in Derbyshire, where homebound rats are missing the detritus of tourism in Bakewell and Buxton. Mike Flynn, the boss of Alpha Pest Control in Stoke-on-Trent, remembers a recent call to a house where the father had seen a rat going from the upstairs landing into a toddler’s bedroom. He’d searched the room for the animal’s hiding place without success. “We arrived and did probably the same search, but no one had thought to look in the cot,” Flynn says. “I remember picking up the pillow and being just as horrified as the rat that stared back at me. ” A chase ensued – and a decisive blow to the head. Belmain is receiving dozens of emails from homeowners with rat problems. Some have cats that are catching more rats as the urban food chain shifts. Flynn says cats – often seen as free pest control – don’t always help. Rats love catflaps. And cats that enjoy catching and toying with rats can give them a lift indoors, where those with non-lethal injuries can recover to make a new home. Flynn recommends flaps unlocked by smart cat collars that are also equipped with bells to scare off would-be prey. The feeding of any animals in gardens, including foxes and birds, is an invitation to rodent intruders. Decking creates a lovely home for garden rats, while chicken coops are rat Disneyland. Flynn, who used to advise the government on infestations in food stockpiles, was once called out to a commercial chicken house containing 16,000 free-range birds. There were more than 3,000 rats living in it, gorging on guano. Feeding any animals in a garden is an invitation to rodents. Cleankill was recently called out to a garage where a motor home was being stored. Rats were swarming in the engine compartment and eating the fabric that covered the seats in which they had nested. The firm was able to evict the squatters before they moved on to the house. Hungry rats are more likely to be aggressive. by a rat while using his loo after local flooding. “I would advise homeowners to keep their toilet seats down when not in use, and to watch their posteriors,” Noel Collins told the city’s Evening Echo. Flynn was once called out to a museum on a routine visit, where he learned that the night security guard had taken to feeding rats. “He got them to come closer and closer to his office using bits of his dinner,” Flynn recalls. “He managed to entice one inside. It promptly attacked him and bit him. He needed hospital treatment for his wound. Belmain fell into the rat field by accident. He was an insect guy before work in rural areas in developing countries left him fascinated by the scale of rodent infestations, rat behaviour – and the relationship between humans and rats. “You have to be part natural scientist and part anthropologist to understand rats,” he says. Rats are basically just squirrels with bald tails. Rat research was much bigger after the second world war, during a quest for an effective poison. Rats have evolved to be wary of unfamiliar food, and had learned to stop eating poisons that made them immediately ill before they received a lethal dose. Scientists then discovered that anticoagulants worked better because they took days to thin the blood, causing internal organs to haemorrhage. Hapless rats would come back for more. Warfarin-based rat poison, the development of which gave rise to treatment for blood clots and strokes in humans, remains the standard for councils and pest controllers. Part of Belmain’s work, mainly still in developing countries, is now to consider the less desirable effects of poisoning on the food chain, including in birds of prey. He also researches the bubonic plague and the age-old role of rats as disease carriers. “We’re taught to be fearful of them; it’s ingrained in our culture,” he says. It’s perhaps no surprise that reports of marauding, bottom-biting cannibal rats strike fear into the heart during a global health crisis. , sales of which have been healthy in lockdown, is a swarming of rats from the sewers. Yet other rodents can do more damage in the home. Grey squirrels, which are often found in loft space, can chomp through wires and insulation, and contaminate water tanks. And yes, they’ll also eat each other if they need to. “Rats are just squirrels with bald tails,” says Paul Gowland of Cobra North East, a pest control company in Sunderland. “One gets all the nice stuff; the other is vilified. Rats can breed at an astonishing rate when times become less lean. They can conceive as soon as they give birth, and then deliver the next litter while still weaning the first. Young rats start to reproduce after two or three months. “The population has declined in the past few months but as soon as the restaurants reopen, I think they’ll find their old habitats again,” Belmain says. “They’ll get back to normal, probably, before we do.</data>

			<data> Well – not the happiest of days for those living in the 36 Melbourne suburbs that are returning to lockdown for another month. Let’s recap the biggest developments of the day. The new measures will remain in place until 29 July. booze bus-style checkpoints will be set up at main entry and exit points to ensure people have a good reason to travel to or from the hotspots. It’s an attempt to control the outbreak in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, which Andrews said was linked to security guards working in hotels where returned travellers were undergoing mandatory quarantine. we will finish up in a situation [where] we will be locking down every postcode”. A judge will be asked to conduct an inquiry into failures of infection control in hotel quarantine, with a report due in less than two months. and the state will not accept anyone new into mandatory hotel quarantine in that time. Andrews says the other states will have to pick up the slack. federal assistance including 200 clinicians to help with a testing blitz in the hotspot suburbs. , and false statements will earn a $4,000 fine. It’s still considering opening the border to the ACT and NSW, and is already open to WA, the NT and Queensland. If you’re in Melbourne, and particularly if you’re in a hotspot area, pay attention to social distancing rules and wash your hands frequently. Stay safe, stay strong and we’ll see you in the morning. The ever-evolving explainer on Australia’s lockdown rules has been updated to incorporate the new restrictions on hotspots, which will come into effect at 11. Australia's Covid-19 restrictions and coronavirus lockdown rules explained: how far can I travel, and can I have people over? ventured to the hotspot suburb of Keilor this morning to talk to locals about how they were feeling about the return to lockdown. confirmed it this afternoon. She spoke to a Muslim woman who said she felt targeted by recent media commentary that suggested, on no evidence, that Muslim families were responsible for the spread. No one has come up to my face and said, ‘You are causing coronavirus’, but it’s little things. It’s the things you see online and little comments that are made. .. It’s not the nicest thing to hear because when this all started and it was on the other side of the city, no one mentioned race then. Here is a map of all the areas of Melbourne subject to stage 3 stay-at-home orders. for that map. The full list of the postcodes, which stretch across 36 suburbs, is below. the lockdown is based on postcodes, not suburbs, so if there is some confusion between the two for you, go with the postcode. Postcode 3012: Brooklyn, Kingsville, Maidstone, Tottenham and West Footscray. Postcode 3032: Ascot Vale, Highpoint City, Maribyrnong and Travancore. Postcode 3055: Brunswick South, Brunswick West, Moonee Vale and Moreland West. (Australia Post lists Niddrie North as a separate suburb in this postcode, but the Victorian government release does not. Postcode 3046: Glenroy, Hadfield, and Oak Park. confirmed that nightclubs could reopen from tonight, but patrons had to be seated and maintain a 1.

Several of the Brisbane Broncos are also there, sitting and drinking beers at a sensible distance. We’ll celebrate anything, at this point. was asked earlier today about the possibility of a suburb-based lockdown at a press conference in Lobs Hole, NSW, where he is on the campaign trail for the Eden-Monaro byelection. — which is the same thing Andrew said. and South Australia have, or close a previously unclosed border, as NSW has been pressured to do. I want to commend the Northern Territory government with how they’re dealing with this. The Northern Territory government has kept their borders open but they’ve said if you’re coming from one of those hotspots, then you have to declare it and you have to go into quarantine in the Northern Territory. That’s how this should be done. That’s the right way to do it. There will be outbreaks. We need to ensure our economy builds back with confidence and with resilience. So I think it’s important that the borders are open. makes little sense. There is a hotspot in one part of Melbourne. Admittedly, it’s very serious, it has our total focus, and it is of great concern. So we’ve got to get some perspective, and that’s why I commend the Northern Territory government on the approach they’re taking. They have very sensitive communities in the Northern Territory and I think they’ve made this call absolutely right and are showing leadership that I think the other states should follow. I take the point, but Wangaratta is just three hours drive from Melbourne and a lot of people who grew up in Wangaratta (hello) now live in Melbourne and return home frequently to visit family. Not calling for a Wangaratta lockdown, but I reckon there’s been significantly more movement in recent weeks between Melbourne’s hotspot suburbs and Wangaratta than between those hotspots and Whyalla. two new Covid-19 cases, both in hotel quarantine. They are a man in his 40s, who travelled from the UK, and a woman in her 60s, who travelled from Pakistan. One of the biggest takeaways from the Covid-19 committee inquiry hearing today is that, even though jobkeeper isn’t accessible to everyone who needs it, the arts industry is begging the government to keep it going beyond September. , the chief executive of Live Performance Australia, told the committee that the industry was talking about how nervous people were about jobkeeper running out because, even if businesses can reopen by September, “shows could get shut down for 24 hours, two days or two weeks”. , said providing jobkeeper until venues could reopen would prevent artists and workers from having to leave the live performance industry permanently. We are a bit like a trade. It is not something you can learn in the classroom. You need to be on the ground learning these skills. Keeping those industries and those suppliers and those crew, keeping them on the books, is really important. Burke says the Morrison government should extend jobkeeper and the increased payment to jobseeker past the planned cut-off in September, in response to some suburbs in Melbourne returning to lockdown. More states may end up in a similar situation in the coming months, who knows. But it makes it increasingly ridiculous for the government to claim that all the protections, including jobkeeper, are going to fall off a cliff in September. If they do that, at a time where the economy is going to be as fragile as this, they are simply pushing a whole lot of businesses and a whole lot of jobs straight to a cliff. This is partly a valid point but mainly another call for the government to release the jobkeeper review before the Eden-Monaro byelection on 4 July. and Victoria, which remains open and, both states have said, will not be closed. There are, he says, “so many crossing points”. As a person who grew up near the Murray, I’ll chime in and say I cannot imagine how you would police it. There are twin cities, twin towns, all along the Murray River. It’s barely a border. I’ve also noticed that much has been made on Queensland requiring Victorians who want to travel north to undergo a 14-day quarantine, and pay for that quarantine. That is exactly what WA has been doing for everyone since late March. is on ABC24, and is asked by host Patricia Karvelas about the success of Australia’s health response. Says PK: “Because clearly our efforts to suppress the virus haven’t worked everywhere. We are one of the most successful countries in the world at dealing with suppressing the virus . Certainly what we’ve done with social distancing and hand hygiene has made a real difference and a significant difference. , they will do the contact tracing as quickly as they can, they have taken very serious actions today. I think it would be a big mistake as a nation, if we were to look at there being a second outbreak and saying somehow we failed on the health response. in terms of the health response I wouldn’t think for a minute we as a nation should lose our nerve on how we got this far. Leave the fruit bats out of it, please. in face of Victoria’s transmissions. backing up Vic authorities re: local lockdowns/testing requests, in a short sharp press conference.

			<data> Good morning and welcome to the top stories on this last day of June. and schools will close from Thursday (apart from for vulnerable children and those of essential workers) in the first local lockdown in England. Addressing the Commons at around 9pm last night, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, described the “difficult but important decisions” to reimpose measures on the city, which has seen nearly 950 new infections in a fortnight: “Given the growing outbreak in Leicester, we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown, set to take place on 4 July,” he said. Hancock said this meant people should “stay home as much as you can” and avoid all non-essential travel to, from and within the city. Overnight Leicester council’s website said it was awaiting confirmation of all areas that would be affected, but Hancock said it would apply to the surrounding areas of the city, including Oadby, a town three miles south, and the villages of Glenfield and Birstall, three miles north. The changes will be reviewed in two weeks. The details of what’s being imposed are here. People queue at a walk-in coronavirus testing centre in Leicester.

But about eight million of them could be thrust into poverty because of the coronavirus and its economic fallout, according to World Data Lab, a research organization. World Bank experts say the pandemic is threatening to push as many as 58 million people in Africa into extreme poverty. The setbacks may be felt for years. For the last decade, the middle class has helped drive educational, political and economic development across the continent.

			<data> The investigation into Russia’s suspected operation is said to focus in part on the killings of three Marines in a truck bombing last year, officials said. The site of an attack in April 2019 in which three American service members were killed near Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. American officials provided a written briefing in late February to President Trump laying out their conclusion that a Russian military intelligence unit offered and paid bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U. S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan, two officials familiar with the matter said. The investigation into the suspected Russian covert operation to incentivize such killings has focused in part on an April 2019 car bombing that killed three Marines as one such potential attack, according to multiple officials familiar with the matter. The new information emerged as the White House tried on Monday to play down the intelligence assessment that Russia sought to encourage and reward killings — including reiterating a claim that Mr. Trump was never briefed about the matter and portraying the conclusion as disputed and dubious. But that stance clashed with the disclosure by two officials that the intelligence was included months ago in Mr. Trump’s President’s Daily Brief document — a compilation of the government’s latest secrets and best insights about foreign policy and national security that is prepared for him to read. One of the officials said the item appeared in Mr. Trump’s brief in late February; the other cited Feb. Moreover, a description of the intelligence assessment that the Russian unit had carried out the bounties plot was also seen as serious and solid enough to disseminate more broadly across the intelligence community in a May 4 article in the C. ’s World Intelligence Review, a classified compendium commonly referred to as The Wire, two officials said. A National Security Council spokesman declined to comment on any connection between the Marines’ deaths and the suspected Russian plot. whether the intelligence was included in the written President’s Daily Brief, and the National Security Council spokesman pointed to her comments when asked later about the February written briefing. Late Monday, John Ratcliffe, the recently confirmed director of national intelligence, issued a statement warning that leaks about the matter were a crime. “We are still investigating the alleged intelligence referenced in recent media reporting, and we will brief the president and congressional leaders at the appropriate time,” he said. “This is the analytic process working the way it should. Unfortunately, unauthorized disclosures now jeopardize our ability to ever find out the full story with respect to these allegations. The disclosures came amid a growing furor in Washington over the revelations in recent days that the Trump administration had known for months about the intelligence conclusion but the White House had authorized no response to Russia. John Ratcliffe, the recently confirmed director of national intelligence, condemned disclosures about classified intelligence. Top Democrats in the House and Senate demanded that all members of Congress be briefed, and the White House summoned a small group of House Republicans friendly to the president to begin explaining its position. The lawmakers emerged saying that they were told the administration was reviewing reporting about the suspected Russian plot to assess its credibility. They also said the underlying intelligence was conflicting, echoing comments from Ms. McEnany that the information in the assessment had not been “verified” because, she said without detail, there were “dissenting opinions” among analysts or agencies. “There was not a consensus among the intelligence community,” Ms. “And, in fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community, and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified. that the reports were unsubstantiated. But in denying that Mr. Trump was briefed, administration officials have been coy about how it is defining that concept and whether it includes both oral briefings and the President’s Daily Brief. “He was not personally briefed on the matter,” Ms. McEnany told reporters when asked specifically about the written briefing. “That is all I can share with you today. Trump is said to often neglect reading that document, preferring instead to receive an oral briefing summarizing highlights every few days. on national security matters. He often relies instead on conservative media and friends for information, current and former intelligence officials have said. American intelligence officers and Special Operations forces in Afghanistan began raising alarms as early as January, and the National Security Council convened an interagency meeting to discuss the problem and what to do about it in late March, The New York Times has previously reported. But despite being presented with options, including a diplomatic protest and sanctions, the White House authorized no response. The administration’s explanations on Monday, in public and in private, appeared to be an attempt to placate lawmakers, particularly Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans, alarmed by news reports in recent days revealing the existence of the intelligence assessment and Mr. Trump’s insistence he had not been warned of the suspected Russian plot. The assessments pointing to a Russian scheme to offer bounties to Taliban-linked militants and criminals were based on information collected in raids and interrogations on the ground in Afghanistan, where American military commanders came to believe Russia was behind the plot, as well as more sensitive and unspecified intelligence that came in over time, an American official said. Officials said there was disagreement among intelligence officials about the strength of the evidence about the suspected Russian plot and the evidence linking the attack on the Marines to the suspected Russian plot, but they did not detail those disputes. Notably, the National Security Agency, which specializes in hacking and electronic surveillance, has been more skeptical about interrogations and other human intelligence, officials said. Typically, the president is formally briefed when the information has been vetted and seen as sufficiently credible and important by the intelligence professionals. Such information would most likely be included in the President’s Daily Brief. Former officials said that in previous administrations, accusations of such profound importance — even if the evidence was not fully established — were conveyed to the president. “We had two threshold questions: ‘Does the president need to know this? ’ and ‘Why does he need to know it now? ’” said Robert Cardillo, a former senior intelligence official who briefed President Barack Obama from 2010 to 2014. David Priess, a former C. daily intelligence briefer and the author of “The President’s Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings to America’s Presidents,” said: “Many intelligence judgments in history have not had the consensus of every analyst who worked on it. That’s the nature of intelligence. It’s inherently dealing with uncertainty. Cardillo and Mr. Priess said previous presidents received assessments on issues of potentially vital importance even if they had dissents from some analysts or agencies. The dissents, they said, were highlighted for the president to help them understand uncertainties and the analytic process. Lawmakers demanded to see the underlying material for themselves. “This is a time to focus on the two things Congress should be asking and looking at: No. 1, who knew what, when, and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not? ” said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Speaker Nancy Pelosi requested that all members of the House be briefed on intelligence about a suspected Russian plot against U. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, each requested that all lawmakers be briefed on the matter and for C. and other intelligence officials to explain how Mr. Trump was informed of intelligence collected about the plot. The White House began explaining its position directly to lawmakers in a carefully controlled setting. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; Mr. Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence; and Mr. O’Brien briefed a handful of invited House Republicans. A group of House Democrats was scheduled to go to the White House on Tuesday morning to receive a similar briefing. There was no indication after the session with Republicans whether they had been told that the information was included in Mr. Trump’s written briefing four months ago. But afterward, two of the Republicans — Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Mac Thornberry of Texas — said that they “remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U. S. forces” and would need additional briefings. “It has been clear for some time that Russia does not wish us well in Afghanistan,” they said in a joint statement. “We believe it is important to vigorously pursue any information related to Russia or any other country targeting our forces. Other Republicans who attended the briefing were more sanguine. In an interview, Representative Chris Stewart of Utah said he saw nothing unusual about the purported decision not to orally inform Mr. Trump, particularly when the situation did not require the president to take immediate action. “It just didn’t reach the level of credibility to bring it to the president’s attention,” he said, adding that military and intelligence agencies should continue to scrutinize Russia’s activities. They were killed near Bagram Air Base when a vehicle laden with explosives hit their truck, wounding an Afghan contractor as well. The huge blast set fire to the truck, engulfing those inside in flames, while their fellow Marines tried to extricate them, a defense official said. A brief firefight ensued. Zaman Mamozai, the former police chief of Parwan Province, where Bagram Airfield is, said that the Taliban there hire freelancers from local criminal networks, often blurring the lines of who carried out what attacks. He said the Taliban’s commanders were only based in two districts of the province, Seyagird and Shinwari, and from there they coordinate a more extensive network that largely commissions the services of criminals. The Taliban have denied involvement. And a spokesman for President Vladimir V. that reports of the Russian scheme were incorrect. He said that “none of the American representatives have ever raised this question” with their Russian counterparts through government or diplomatic channels. The Pentagon’s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, declined to comment on any connection between the Marines’ deaths and the suspected Russian plot. He also declined to say whether or when Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper was briefed on the intelligence assessment and whether the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan resulted from the Russian bounties. Hoffman issued a statement saying that the Defense Department was monitoring intelligence on the matter and that it “has no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations found in open-source reports. DeDe Halfhill, a spokeswoman for Gen. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also declined to comment on the same questions. Reporting was contributed by Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Fahim Abed, Annie Karni and Emily Cochrane.

Top Democrats in the House and Senate demanded that all members of Congress be briefed, and the White House summoned a small group of House Republicans friendly to the president to begin explaining its position. The lawmakers emerged saying that they were told the administration was reviewing reporting about the suspected Russian plot to assess its credibility. They also said the underlying intelligence was conflicting, echoing comments from Ms. McEnany that the information in the assessment had not been “verified” because, she said without detail, there were “dissenting opinions” among analysts or agencies. “There was not a consensus among the intelligence community,” Ms. “And, in fact, there were dissenting opinions within the intelligence community, and it would not be elevated to the president until it was verified. that the reports were unsubstantiated. But in denying that Mr. Trump was briefed, administration officials have been coy about how it is defining that concept and whether it includes both oral briefings and the President’s Daily Brief. “He was not personally briefed on the matter,” Ms. McEnany told reporters when asked specifically about the written briefing. “That is all I can share with you today. Trump is said to often neglect reading that document, preferring instead to receive an oral briefing summarizing highlights every few days. on national security matters. He often relies instead on conservative media and friends for information, current and former intelligence officials have said. American intelligence officers and Special Operations forces in Afghanistan began raising alarms as early as January, and the National Security Council convened an interagency meeting to discuss the problem and what to do about it in late March, The New York Times has previously reported. But despite being presented with options, including a diplomatic protest and sanctions, the White House authorized no response. The administration’s explanations on Monday, in public and in private, appeared to be an attempt to placate lawmakers, particularly Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans, alarmed by news reports in recent days revealing the existence of the intelligence assessment and Mr. Trump’s insistence he had not been warned of the suspected Russian plot. The assessments pointing to a Russian scheme to offer bounties to Taliban-linked militants and criminals were based on information collected in raids and interrogations on the ground in Afghanistan, where American military commanders came to believe Russia was behind the plot, as well as more sensitive and unspecified intelligence that came in over time, an American official said. Officials said there was disagreement among intelligence officials about the strength of the evidence about the suspected Russian plot and the evidence linking the attack on the Marines to the suspected Russian plot, but they did not detail those disputes. Notably, the National Security Agency, which specializes in hacking and electronic surveillance, has been more skeptical about interrogations and other human intelligence, officials said. Typically, the president is formally briefed when the information has been vetted and seen as sufficiently credible and important by the intelligence professionals. Such information would most likely be included in the President’s Daily Brief. Former officials said that in previous administrations, accusations of such profound importance — even if the evidence was not fully established — were conveyed to the president. “We had two threshold questions: ‘Does the president need to know this? ’ and ‘Why does he need to know it now? ’” said Robert Cardillo, a former senior intelligence official who briefed President Barack Obama from 2010 to 2014. David Priess, a former C. daily intelligence briefer and the author of “The President’s Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings to America’s Presidents,” said: “Many intelligence judgments in history have not had the consensus of every analyst who worked on it. That’s the nature of intelligence. It’s inherently dealing with uncertainty. Cardillo and Mr. Priess said previous presidents received assessments on issues of potentially vital importance even if they had dissents from some analysts or agencies. The dissents, they said, were highlighted for the president to help them understand uncertainties and the analytic process. Lawmakers demanded to see the underlying material for themselves. “This is a time to focus on the two things Congress should be asking and looking at: No. 1, who knew what, when, and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not? ” said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Speaker Nancy Pelosi requested that all members of the House be briefed on intelligence about a suspected Russian plot against U. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, each requested that all lawmakers be briefed on the matter and for C. and other intelligence officials to explain how Mr. Trump was informed of intelligence collected about the plot. The White House began explaining its position directly to lawmakers in a carefully controlled setting. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; Mr. Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence; and Mr. O’Brien briefed a handful of invited House Republicans. A group of House Democrats was scheduled to go to the White House on Tuesday morning to receive a similar briefing. There was no indication after the session with Republicans whether they had been told that the information was included in Mr. Trump’s written briefing four months ago. But afterward, two of the Republicans — Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Mac Thornberry of Texas — said that they “remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U. S. forces” and would need additional briefings. “It has been clear for some time that Russia does not wish us well in Afghanistan,” they said in a joint statement. “We believe it is important to vigorously pursue any information related to Russia or any other country targeting our forces. Other Republicans who attended the briefing were more sanguine. In an interview, Representative Chris Stewart of Utah said he saw nothing unusual about the purported decision not to orally inform Mr. Trump, particularly when the situation did not require the president to take immediate action. “It just didn’t reach the level of credibility to bring it to the president’s attention,” he said, adding that military and intelligence agencies should continue to scrutinize Russia’s activities. They were killed near Bagram Air Base when a vehicle laden with explosives hit their truck, wounding an Afghan contractor as well. The huge blast set fire to the truck, engulfing those inside in flames, while their fellow Marines tried to extricate them, a defense official said. A brief firefight ensued. Zaman Mamozai, the former police chief of Parwan Province, where Bagram Airfield is, said that the Taliban there hire freelancers from local criminal networks, often blurring the lines of who carried out what attacks. He said the Taliban’s commanders were only based in two districts of the province, Seyagird and Shinwari, and from there they coordinate a more extensive network that largely commissions the services of criminals. The Taliban have denied involvement. And a spokesman for President Vladimir V. that reports of the Russian scheme were incorrect. He said that “none of the American representatives have ever raised this question” with their Russian counterparts through government or diplomatic channels. The Pentagon’s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, declined to comment on any connection between the Marines’ deaths and the suspected Russian plot. He also declined to say whether or when Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper was briefed on the intelligence assessment and whether the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan resulted from the Russian bounties. Hoffman issued a statement saying that the Defense Department was monitoring intelligence on the matter and that it “has no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations found in open-source reports. DeDe Halfhill, a spokeswoman for Gen. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also declined to comment on the same questions.

			<data> The Supreme Court Stopped Anti-Abortion Momentum. The Supreme Court Stopped Anti-Abortion Momentum. The movement has a long pipeline of new cases that, if taken up by the Supreme Court, could present a more direct challenge to Roe v. An anti-abortion protester reacted outside the Supreme Court after it struck down a contentious Louisiana state abortion law in Washington on Monday. against a Louisiana law delivered a stinging and surprising setback. But perhaps not for long. The anti-abortion movement has a long pipeline of new cases that, if taken up by the Supreme Court, could present a more direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established federal protection for abortion. As of June, there were at least 16 abortion cases before United States appeals courts, the last step before the Supreme Court, according to lawyers at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Louisiana case, over a 2014 law that required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, was never envisioned as a way to upend Roe v. It was one small piece of a broader strategy to restrict abortion through myriad state laws that put together could chip away at overall access. That political project has already significantly narrowed abortion access in large areas of the South and the Midwest. And at least five states have only one abortion clinic each left: Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia. The decision on Monday, the first major abortion case since President Trump shifted the court’s balance of power to the right, also showed for the first time that Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh sided with the anti-abortion cause, as hoped by longtime activists. The ruling will only further the push by social conservatives to re-elect Mr. Trump so he might have a third opportunity to nominate a justice in time to rule on more significant abortion cases working their way up to the Supreme Court. Many of those laws would have a far greater reach than the Louisiana case. While legal challenges to abortion often take years to reach the Supreme Court, states have continued to add to the list, passing dozens of new laws in recent years. This month, Tennessee passed a bill that would outlaw abortions as early as six weeks in pregnancy without exceptions for rape or incest. The president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, called Monday’s ruling a “bitter disappointment,” but, looking ahead to the November election, praised Mr. Trump for appointing Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, who dissented in the decision. “It is imperative that we re-elect President Trump and our pro-life majority in the U. S. Senate so we can further restore the judiciary, most especially the Supreme Court,” the group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said. “President Trump, assisted by the pro-life Senate majority, is keeping his promise to appoint constitutionalist Supreme Court justices and other federal judges. For the abortion-rights movement, which has faced a number of disappointments in recent years, the ruling was the best outcome that advocates could have hoped for, given the new conservative tilt of the court. Monday’s decision allows Louisiana’s three remaining abortion clinics to stay open. Abortion-rights advocates said the win would preserve access for a clientele that is disproportionately poor and of color. About 8,000 abortions were performed in Louisiana in 2018, according to state statistics. of abortion patients there are women of color. at the center of the case. On Monday morning, the clinic was seeing patients, and she described the mood after the ruling as “absolute giddiness. November is an important juncture for the fight over abortion. Trump’s bid for re-election will test the depth of his backing among white evangelicals and Catholics who support the president for how much he has advanced anti-abortion policies. Control of state legislatures is also on the table. Nearly 80 percent of state seats are up for election this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Whichever party gets majority control will have tremendous power to reshape the legal landscape for abortion for years to come. around the country, which has allowed them to pass a flurry of bans in recent years. For conservatives, Monday’s ruling is a political opportunity to energize Mr.
, including in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania where white Catholics may be important swing voters. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, called the ruling “unfortunate. “Instead of valuing fundamental democratic principles, unelected justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of state governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate abortion safety regulations,” she said in a statement. The abortion-rights movement had been using Mr. Trump’s appointments of Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as rallying calls for campaigns to take Senate seats, such as those held by Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa. Monday’s ruling seemed to reinforce that strategy. “As long as Kavanaugh is on the bench, our rights are on the line—and we need your help to flip the Senate. Lawyers for the clinic argued that their victory was resounding because it involved the Supreme Court’s ruling in their favor for the second time in four years on a case involving admitting privileges. The law was almost identical to a Texas law, large parts of which the Supreme Court struck down in 2016, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer said as much in his opinion. Even Chief Justice John G.
, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights and a lawyer for the clinic. The message, he said, was that “states should really knock this off. But in many ways the ruling was narrow — putting to rest merely one of many legal strategies used by the anti-abortion movement to reduce access. Legislatures, largely in red states, passed dozens of anti-abortion laws last year alone. Nor is it a given that the 5-to-4 decision means that Chief Justice Roberts will always side with the court’s liberal wing on abortion cases. Though he was the deciding vote for Monday’s ruling, the chief justice specified in his concurring opinion that he believed the 2016 precedent that Monday’s ruling was based on was “wrongly decided. Lawyers for the Louisiana clinic conceded that Chief Justice Roberts had not come down conclusively on their side. “The opinion did muddy the waters a little bit,” said Julie Rikelman, a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights who argued Monday’s case before the Supreme Court on behalf of the clinic. “It will lead to more litigation, not less. While the toughest bans — ones prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected — have drawn considerable attention, Ms. Rikelman said she did not expect those to be taken up by the Supreme Court. More likely, she said, would be any number of cases that diminish access piece by piece. The next major case could be over bans on the dilation and evacuation procedure that is common in the second trimester of pregnancy, or on abortion based on a Down syndrome diagnosis.

Alarmed by Sun Belt Spike, N. The New Jersey governor postponed plans to allow indoor dining this week, and New York officials are considering a similar pause. Restaurants in New York City had been poised to begin serving patrons indoors on July 6.
that they were reconsidering plans to allow indoor dining in the two states in the coming days. to allow indoor dining to resume on Thursday would be postponed “indefinitely. “We have seen spikes in other states driven in part by the return of patrons to indoor dining establishments, where they are seated and without face coverings for significant periods of time,” Mr. “We do not wish to see New Jersey experience a similar spike. of its reopening on July 6, which would have allowed restaurants and other establishments to serve patrons indoors if they cut their capacity in half and followed various other restrictions. Indoor dining is already allowed in the rest of the state under the conditions. But at a news conference on Monday, Gov. Cuomo said that officials were now considering whether indoor dining could restart safely in the city and that he would make a decision on Wednesday. The announcement by the governors stunned restaurant owners, whose businesses have been decimated by the pandemic. Many restaurants have been preparing to reopen by expanding their staffs and increasing inventory as they struggle to recover financially. Amy Russo, the owner of three New Jersey restaurants named Toast, was angry about Mr. Murphy’s shift, which came as she prepared to open her dining rooms in Asbury Park, Montclair and Red Bank. We’ve done the buying — we do Sunday for Monday deliveries. We’ve got the food in. “It’s not just indoor dining alone,” the governor said. “Indoor dining in New York City, where you already have issues with high congregations, you already have issues of people clearly violating social distancing, and you now have an added factor of viral spread all across the nation, and a high likelihood that those people will come to New York City. It’s that combination of facts that’s precarious. Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a news briefing on Monday, said that indoor dining appeared to be a factor in states that were now experiencing a rush of new virus cases. “The indoor dining element is now in question,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We’re going to work it through with the state, figure out how we want to approach it, if we want to pause that piece for a while or modify it. The reconsideration of whether to allow indoor dining was another sign that New York City is far from returning to normal. , and many producers have hinted that they do not expect their shows to be back onstage until late winter or early spring. Epidemiologists say that eating indoors poses a particularly high risk for transmitting the virus even if certain precautions — spacing out seats, making sure ventilation is adequate, ensuring that employees observe strict hygiene practices — are taken. “As soon as you get into indoor dining, your mask comes off and you have the potential for aerosols to be generated not only from breathing and talking but also from eating,” said Krystal Pollitt, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. In Michigan, more than 70 cases were linked to Harper’s Restaurant and Brewpub in East Lansing. In Alaska, the Seward Alehouse closed and encouraged customers to get tested after an employee contracted the virus. On Sunday, California officials ordered bars to close in some cities, including Los Angeles, and recommended that they close in others. The New York City Hospitality Alliance, a business group that represents restaurants and bars, said in an email to its members on Monday that it had asked officials to make a decision on indoor dining quickly. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. Many businesses, the alliance said, could not survive a short-lived reopening of some indoor dining if new outbreaks forced them to shut down again. State data showed that in March and April, dine-in restaurants in New York City eliminated more than 119,000 jobs. “New York City restaurants and bars have been financially devastated,” the alliance said. “Our small businesses urgently need certainty and immediate support on rent, expanded outdoor dining and other responsive policies if they are to have any real chance of survival and recovery. Marilou Halvorsen, the president of the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association, a trade group, said that Mr. Murphy’s decision to postpone indoor dining would be financially devastating to many business owners. In advance of the reopening, she said, restaurants had bought food and supplies and rehired staff members. “We’re two days from reopening,” Ms. “We’ve had restaurants invest tens of thousands of dollars that they did not have. She said a better way to avoid the risk of overcrowded restaurants and bars would be to step up the enforcement of the state’s limits on the number of people allowed inside. to 25 percent of their indoor capacity. “Instead of addressing enforcement, which is what they should do, you’re going to take a sledgehammer to a whole industry? Sweeney, the State Senate president, said that for New Jersey’s casinos, which are scheduled to reopen on Thursday, the ability to serve food and drinks was a big part of the financial equation in welcoming customers again. Now, gamblers will not have access to indoor restaurants or bars. At least one casino, the Borgata in Atlantic City, responded to Mr. Murphy’s announcement by saying it would remain closed until the governor “lets us know it is safe to offer food and beverage. “It’s not even workable,” Mr. Christina Goldbaum, Matthew Haag and Tracey Tully contributed reporting.

Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. Many businesses, the alliance said, could not survive a short-lived reopening of some indoor dining if new outbreaks forced them to shut down again. State data showed that in March and April, dine-in restaurants in New York City eliminated more than 119,000 jobs. “New York City restaurants and bars have been financially devastated,” the alliance said. “Our small businesses urgently need certainty and immediate support on rent, expanded outdoor dining and other responsive policies if they are to have any real chance of survival and recovery. Marilou Halvorsen, the president of the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association, a trade group, said that Mr. Murphy’s decision to postpone indoor dining would be financially devastating to many business owners. In advance of the reopening, she said, restaurants had bought food and supplies and rehired staff members. “We’re two days from reopening,” Ms. “We’ve had restaurants invest tens of thousands of dollars that they did not have. She said a better way to avoid the risk of overcrowded restaurants and bars would be to step up the enforcement of the state’s limits on the number of people allowed inside. to 25 percent of their indoor capacity. “Instead of addressing enforcement, which is what they should do, you’re going to take a sledgehammer to a whole industry? Sweeney, the State Senate president, said that for New Jersey’s casinos, which are scheduled to reopen on Thursday, the ability to serve food and drinks was a big part of the financial equation in welcoming customers again. Now, gamblers will not have access to indoor restaurants or bars. At least one casino, the Borgata in Atlantic City, responded to Mr. Murphy’s announcement by saying it would remain closed until the governor “lets us know it is safe to offer food and beverage. “It’s not even workable,” Mr. Christina Goldbaum, Matthew Haag and Tracey Tully contributed reporting.</data>

			<data> The Supreme Court’s rejection of a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s dissent, may create new challenges for Susan Collins and other Republican senators up for re-election. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, outside the Senate Chamber this month. The Supreme Court ruling on abortion has underscored what may be one of her biggest vulnerabilities. in her race against Senator Susan Collins. Collins, a Maine Republican, cast a decisive vote to confirm Justice Brett M. that he would uphold precedent to preserve abortion rights. But on Monday, Justice Kavanaugh dissented from a decision that did that, arguing that the court should have ruled differently than it did in a nearly identical case four years ago. “Do you still think Brett Kavanaugh believes Roe v. Wade is settled law, @SenSusanCollins? Collins’s likely Democratic opponent. of her vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh — and the new ruling has taken what may be one of her biggest vulnerabilities and put it squarely at the center of public attention. , which struck down a Louisiana law that could have left the state with just a single abortion clinic, reverberated rapidly through Washington and beyond, adding a new focus on one of the most divisive issues in American politics to the critical Senate races that will determine which party controls the chamber in 2021. Advocacy groups both for and against abortion rights signaled that they would use Monday’s ruling — and especially the fact that President Trump’s appointees, Justices Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch, dissented — to try to motivate voters. And political strategists said that although many voters’ opinions on abortion were immovable, Monday’s ruling had vaulted it back into the national conversation after months of focus on the coronavirus and racial inequality. that named Ms. of South Carolina, all of whom voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh. Collins said in a statement that she supported the ruling, and that it was “reading too much into this specific decision” to say Justice Kavanaugh’s dissent indicated that he would vote to outlaw abortion. “As Justice Gorsuch noted, ‘In truth, Roe v. Wade is not even at issue here,’” she said. “And while Justice Kavanaugh called for additional fact finding in this case, he gave no indication in his dissenting opinion that he supports overturning Roe. Gardner and Mr. Tillis are seen as three of the most vulnerable Republicans in the Senate. Ernst’s and Mr. of New York were quick to applaud the decision on Monday as a victory for reproductive rights. But in a sign of what is at stake in November, Democratic officials and Senate candidates like Ms. Gideon also moved swiftly to condemn their Republican opponents, and to emphasize that if Mr. Trump gets another Supreme Court pick, the next ruling could go the other way. “Republican leaders will continue to go after the rights of women and anyone seeking reproductive care to make decisions about their own bodies, their own families and their own futures,” top Democratic National Committee members said in a joint statement. “Democrats are doing everything in our power to flip the Senate, defeat Donald Trump, and make sure Roe remains the law of the land. , including those in competitive races this year. A spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee said the party “values the life and health of both the mother and the unborn baby” and sought to use conservative anger over the ruling to drive turnout in the fall. “It’s unfortunate to see the Supreme Court trample on the prerogatives of states with this decision,” the spokeswoman, Mandi Merritt, said in a statement. “It’s cases like this which serve as a reminder to why President Trump must be re-elected so he can appoint more conservative judges who won’t legislate from the bench. “fundamentally protects women. Supporters of abortion rights argue, and the Supreme Court’s majority opinion agreed, that requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges does not make women safer. Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, said in an interview that she believed the ruling could underscore the stakes of the election for voters who oppose abortion but align with Democrats on other issues. Trump nominated two justices who “made the right decision on the biggest abortion case they’ve had the opportunity to rule on,” Ms. “Whoever wins this election is going to have the opportunity to appoint one to two Supreme Court justices in the next four years, and we have got to make sure that is President Trump, backed up by a pro-life Senate majority. Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, framed Monday’s decision less as a victory than an averted catastrophe, saying in a statement, “Abortion access is not further decimated in Louisiana — for now — but that’s only because Donald Trump’s two Supreme Court appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, didn’t get their way. Both Democratic and Republican pollsters said they believed that voters for whom abortion is a key issue were already highly energized and were unlikely to be moved by Monday’s decision. But Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said that in Maine, Justice Kavanaugh’s dissent could undermine Ms. Collins’s longstanding argument that she is an independent voice within the Republican Party — something Maine voters tend to value. The abortion issue itself could drive some suburban women away from Ms. Collins, she added, especially in the Portland area, but the issue of independence could loom larger statewide. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that swing voters would weigh the strength of their convictions on abortion against concerns like the coronavirus pandemic and racial justice. “There are so many issues that have dominated our discussion almost to the exclusion of everything else,” Mr. Monday’s ruling on abortion could “raise its significance somewhat, as we’re speaking today in June,” he said. “The question remains whether it will be that way a month or two or four from now. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 Senate majority, meaning Democrats must pick up three or four seats — depending who wins the presidency — to give them control of the chamber. They have at least that many targets in mind. and offered a statement Monday in support of the court’s decision, saying, “We cannot rest until reproductive rights are fully protected by federal law. Late Monday, the Colorado Democratic Party released its own statement attacking Mr. Gardner as someone who “has crusaded to restrict reproductive rights for years” and condemning his votes to confirm Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch.

With new cases surging in many parts of the country, at least a dozen states and cities are pulling back on reopening plans, with measures that effectively declare: Not so fast. In Arizona, where case counts are soaring, Gov. Doug Ducey paused operations of bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks for 30 days and banned indoor and outdoor public events or gatherings of 50 or more people. He also moved the first day of public school back to Aug. While he pleaded with Arizonans on Monday to “mask up,” so far Mr. Ducey has refrained from issuing a statewide mask order or reissuing the stay-at-home order he rolled back beginning in mid-May. “Our expectation is that our numbers will be worse” next week, Mr. Ducey said at a news conference in Phoenix. “We’re going to continue to adjust based on what the data or the information says. Even Monday’s executive order allows individual jurisdictions in the state to stage events with large crowds, provided they implement social distancing measures. Ducey issued the new executive order under intense pressure, after weeks of videos and social media posts showed scores of people without masks partying in Scottsdale bars, and over the weekend, in inner tubes on a river. Ducey called Monday’s order, to be enforced by public health officials, “the most severe possible enforcement we have in our tool kit. Still, it was unclear on Monday exactly how enforcing the order would work, since it is silent on many other activities, such as youth sports. “We want to provide some flexibility,” Mr. “Personal responsibility and responsible behavior can go a long way. In Florida, where daily case counts soared to new records over the weekend, the city of Jacksonville said Monday that face masks would be required in any indoor public place where social distancing was not possible. The city is scheduled to host the Republican National Convention in August. Several other cities and counties across the state are also moving to reimpose restrictions in response to the surge, which has followed the reopening of beaches, bars, restaurants and other social activities.

A top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Monday that the surge of coronavirus cases in many states was “very discouraging” and would be hard to bring under control. “I think there was a lot of wishful thinking around the country that, ‘Hey, summer, everything is going to be fine, we’re over this,” Dr. . “And we are not even beginning to be over this. Schuchat, the principal deputy director of C. , has kept a low public profile during the pandemic but has been deeply involved in her agency’s response. On Monday, she painted an unsettling picture with Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association. “There are a lot of worrisome factors about the last week or so,” Dr. While most of the new cases are in younger people, she said, they may spread the virus to older people or others with medical conditions who face a higher risk of death. “So this is really the beginning, and what we hope is that we can take it seriously and slow the transmission,” Dr. “But what I think is very discouraging is we clearly are not at a point where there’s so little virus being spread that it’s going to be easy to snuff out. Her comments came not long after Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, played down the spike in cases, saying, “We’re aware that there are embers that need to be put out. Schuchat also dismissed the idea, promoted earlier this year by President Trump among some others, that the heat of the summer might slow the infection rate. “In terms of the weather or the season helping us, I don’t think we can count on that,” she said. Schuchat said there was not enough data yet to answer many questions, including how much protection antibodies provide. “This one has not been easy,” she said. “I think we need to continue to learn and continue to apply what we’re learning and be humble about our assumptions. 43 percent of U.

Relying on reports from states, counties and individual facilities, as well as some data from the federal government, The Times has tracked 282,000 known coronavirus cases at some 12,000 facilities. Most of the country’s largest clusters have emerged in nursing homes, prisons and food processing facilities — places where social distancing is difficult or impossible, and in some cases where shutting down because of the pandemic was not an option. While many of the prison and food processing clusters involved more total cases, the country’s deadliest outbreaks have been largely in nursing homes, where older residents with underlying health problems are uniquely vulnerable to the virus. In nursing homes with large outbreaks, The Times found that about 17 percent of people with the virus died, compared to about 5 percent of all known coronavirus patients. In Minnesota, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, more than three-quarters of all coronavirus deaths have been tied to long-term care facilities. At least six nursing homes, all in the Northeast, have reported 70 or more coronavirus deaths. , as long as safety protocols are followed, Gov. Mike DeWine said on Monday.

The head of the World Health Organization announced that the organization would send experts to China to investigate the original source of the coronavirus. We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is this is not even close to being over. Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up. Tomorrow marks six months since W. received the first reports of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in China. The six-month anniversary of the outbreak coincides with reaching 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths. Knowing the source of the virus is very, very important. It’s science, it’s public health. We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started. And we will be sending a team next week to China to prepare for that. The head of the World Health Organization announced that the organization would send experts to China to investigate the original source of the coronavirus. The World Health Organization will send a team of experts to China next week to investigate the original source of the coronavirus. “We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the organization, said on Monday. , how it was transmitted to humans remains unknown. The outbreak was first identified late last year at a market in Wuhan, China, and one hypothesis is that other poached wildlife sold there might have spread the virus to people. Tedros said it is very important to know the exact zoonotic origin of the virus and understand the science behind it in order to deal with the current pandemic and outbreaks that might occur in the future. delegation led by Dr. and said health officials there were seeing success in suppressing the outbreak. over its initial handling of the outbreak, including delays in reporting the first cases to the W. , and for looking to deflect blame for the epidemic on outsiders. has been reluctant to publicly criticize China, and at times it has praised health officials for providing genetic information about the virus and taking strong action around Wuhan to contain it.

Tedros said that “the worst is yet to come. ” “I am sorry to say that,” he said, “but with this kind of environment and condition, we fear the worst. The House approves a housing relief package. In an effort to intensify pressure on Republicans — and address foreclosure and eviction moratoriums set to expire — House Democrats on Monday approved a stand-alone housing relief package. The provisions in the legislation were initially included in the $3 trillion stimulus bill that the House passed in May, but Senate Republicans have refused to take it up. The legislation, championed by Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California and the House Financial Services Committee, would also allocate more funding to federal housing programs, provide $11. 5 billion for homeless assistance grants and provide billions of dollars to help cover rent, mortgage payments and utility bills. renewed calls to begin negotiating another pandemic relief package amid a continuing surge in cases. , will expire soon without congressional action. Democrats tried to use a procedural maneuver that would allow the legislation to pass the Senate without the full chamber present, but Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, objected, citing concerns that the national debt and deficit would reach “unsustainable levels. The dispute came as Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, slammed Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, for his unwillingness to begin another round of talks. They wrote in a letter to Mr. McConnell that “now is the time for action, not continued delays and political posturing. Though there is widespread acknowledgment on Capitol Hill that another relief package is needed, Mr. McConnell and top Senate Republicans have pushed to delay any negotiations or legislation until after the chamber returns from a two-week July 4 recess. Republicans, however, have repeatedly stressed that Congress should wait before doling out another round of taxpayer aid so they could see the impact of the $2. 2 trillion stimulus package, which became law in March. , but Republicans remain divided over how to balance the need for economic relief with calls to rein in spending. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.

How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.

If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. “While the Democratic House slapped together an absurd multi-trillion-dollar wish list that even the mainstream media panned immediately, the Senate has continued with our substantive, serious, facts-first approach,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “That is the formula we will replicate in any future recovery legislation down the road. New York City officials agree to a smaller budget, including cuts to the police. Police officers in Manhattan on Sunday. After a shutdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus created a $9 billion revenue shortfall, New York City officials on Monday agreed to an austerity budget that includes drastic cuts to city services and a shift of resources out of the New York Police Department. The gloomy $87 billion budget is nearly $6 billion less than the one the city approved last year. The city will demand across-the-board savings from city agencies, and slash services that city residents have come to rely on, such as eliminating the residential composting program and closing city pools for the summer. Trash pickups will be reduced, and overnight service on the Staten Island Ferry will be curtailed. Fewer police traffic agents will be deployed at intersections, and tree pruning and tree stump removal will be less frequent. Frequent calls among activists to defund the New York Police Department were central to negotiations, as activists sought to pare $1 billion from the police’s $6 billion budget. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council agreed on Monday to reach that $1 billion in cuts by, among other things, canceling the planned hiring of 1,163 police officers. But slightly less than half of the $1 billion in cuts will come from a budgetary sleight of hand: School safety officers, who are currently under the auspices of the Police Department, will be moved to the authority of the Department of Education, according to three Council members familiar with the plan. de Blasio still believes the city needs to find $1 billion in labor savings or face 22,000 layoffs, unless the federal government comes through with aid or the state grants the city borrowing authority, according to Mr. Local lockdowns resume in Australia, as dozens of cases bring fears of a resurgence. Australia, which showed early signs of quashing the coronavirus, is now battling spikes in its second-most-populous state, Victoria, leading the authorities to announce lockdowns in 10 postal codes in the greater Melbourne area from 11:59 p. On Tuesday, the state recorded 60 new cases, its 14th consecutive day of double-digit increases. Thirteen of the cases were linked to known outbreaks, 20 were identified through routine testing and 31 more cases were under investigation, the authorities said. The country of 25 million people reported just seven cases in its other states on Tuesday. The numbers pale in comparison to the United States, which has seen tens of thousands of infections reported in recent days, and other countries struggling to limit the spread of the outbreak. and had been internationally praised for its success in battling the virus. Some states have seen no new cases of the virus for weeks. The spikes in Victoria were partly traced to large family gatherings where people failed to observe social distancing, the authorities said. Public health experts have also criticized the government for failing to communicate restrictions effectively to non-English-speaking neighborhoods in Melbourne. On Tuesday, the state of Queensland said it would open its borders to the rest of Australia on July 10, but would exclude anyone who had been in Victoria in the previous 14 days. South Australia also scrapped plans to open its borders with Victoria on July 20. Drought-stricken Puerto Rico will impose water rationing measures in the middle of the pandemic. The drought-stricken bank of the Rio Grande de Loiza in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico, on Monday. Starting on Thursday, nearly 140,000 customers of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, including some in San Juan, the capital, will be without running water every other day, the utility announced on Monday. Public health experts have repeatedly cited frequent hand washing as key to curbing the coronavirus spread. Puerto Rico has reported 7,250 confirmed and probable coronavirus cases and 153 deaths. “We are aware of how necessary water is as a resource in the Covid-19 pandemic, which is why it is important to continue hygiene measures to protect families,” Doriel Pagán, the executive director of the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, said in a statement. She added that the utility does not know how long the rationing measures may last. Wanda Vázquez declared a state of emergency over the worsening drought conditions. Of the island’s 78 municipalities, 21 are in a severe drought and 29 in a moderate drought, Ms. Earlier this month, other water rationing measures were imposed on more than 16,000 customers in northeastern Puerto Rico. The most parched area is the island’s southwest, which is still recovering from a 6. 4 earthquake in early January. The virus is battering Africa’s growing middle class. The Junction mall in Nairobi, Kenya, this month. About 170 million of Africa’s 1. 3 billion people are classified as middle class. , experts at the World Bank say. But beyond the devastating consequences for the continent’s most vulnerable people, the pandemic is also whittling away at one of Africa’s signature achievements: the growth of its middle class. For the last decade, Africa’s middle class has been pivotal to the educational, political and economic development across the continent. New business owners and entrepreneurs have created jobs that, in turn, gave others a leg up as well. Educated, tech-savvy families and young people with money to spare have fed the demand for consumer goods, called for democratic reforms, expanded the talent pool at all levels of society, and pushed for high-quality schools and health care. About 170 million out of Africa’s 1. 3 billion people are now classified as middle class. But about eight million of them could be thrust into poverty because of the coronavirus and its economic fallout, according to World Data Lab, a research organization. “We have been working hard to build better lives,” James Gichina, a tour van driver, said of his colleagues in the tourist sector.

With new cases surging in many parts of the country, at least a dozen states and cities are pulling back on reopening plans, with measures that effectively declare: Not so fast. In Arizona, where case counts are soaring, Gov. Doug Ducey paused operations of bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks for 30 days and banned indoor and outdoor public events or gatherings of 50 or more people. He also moved the first day of public school back to Aug. While he pleaded with Arizonans on Monday to “mask up,” so far Mr. Ducey has refrained from issuing a statewide mask order or reissuing the stay-at-home order he rolled back beginning in mid-May. “Our expectation is that our numbers will be worse” next week, Mr. Ducey said at a news conference in Phoenix. “We’re going to continue to adjust based on what the data or the information says. Even Monday’s executive order allows individual jurisdictions in the state to stage events with large crowds, provided they implement social distancing measures. Ducey issued the new executive order under intense pressure, after weeks of videos and social media posts showed scores of people without masks partying in Scottsdale bars, and over the weekend, in inner tubes on a river. Ducey called Monday’s order, to be enforced by public health officials, “the most severe possible enforcement we have in our tool kit. Still, it was unclear on Monday exactly how enforcing the order would work, since it is silent on many other activities, such as youth sports. “We want to provide some flexibility,” Mr. “Personal responsibility and responsible behavior can go a long way.

A top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Monday that the surge of coronavirus cases in many states was “very discouraging” and would be hard to bring under control. “I think there was a lot of wishful thinking around the country that, ‘Hey, summer, everything is going to be fine, we’re over this,” Dr. . “And we are not even beginning to be over this. Schuchat, the principal deputy director of C. , has kept a low public profile during the pandemic but has been deeply involved in her agency’s response. On Monday, she painted an unsettling picture with Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association. “There are a lot of worrisome factors about the last week or so,” Dr. While most of the new cases are in younger people, she said, they may spread the virus to older people or others with medical conditions who face a higher risk of death. “So this is really the beginning, and what we hope is that we can take it seriously and slow the transmission,” Dr. “But what I think is very discouraging is we clearly are not at a point where there’s so little virus being spread that it’s going to be easy to snuff out. Her comments came not long after Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, played down the spike in cases, saying, “We’re aware that there are embers that need to be put out. Schuchat also dismissed the idea, promoted earlier this year by President Trump among some others, that the heat of the summer might slow the infection rate. “In terms of the weather or the season helping us, I don’t think we can count on that,” she said. Schuchat said there was not enough data yet to answer many questions, including how much protection antibodies provide. “This one has not been easy,” she said. “I think we need to continue to learn and continue to apply what we’re learning and be humble about our assumptions. 43 percent of U. S. virus deaths are tied to nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Refrigerator trucks outside a nursing home in Manhattan in May. , accounting for 43 percent of virus-related deaths in the United States. Relying on reports from states, counties and individual facilities, as well as some data from the federal government, The Times has tracked 282,000 known coronavirus cases at some 12,000 facilities. Most of the country’s largest clusters have emerged in nursing homes, prisons and food processing facilities — places where social distancing is difficult or impossible, and in some cases where shutting down because of the pandemic was not an option. While many of the prison and food processing clusters involved more total cases, the country’s deadliest outbreaks have been largely in nursing homes, where older residents with underlying health problems are uniquely vulnerable to the virus. In nursing homes with large outbreaks, The Times found that about 17 percent of people with the virus died, compared to about 5 percent of all known coronavirus patients. In Minnesota, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, more than three-quarters of all coronavirus deaths have been tied to long-term care facilities. At least six nursing homes, all in the Northeast, have reported 70 or more coronavirus deaths. , as long as safety protocols are followed, Gov. Mike DeWine said on Monday.

The six-month anniversary of the outbreak coincides with reaching 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths. Knowing the source of the virus is very, very important. It’s science, it’s public health. We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started. And we will be sending a team next week to China to prepare for that. The head of the World Health Organization announced that the organization would send experts to China to investigate the original source of the coronavirus. The World Health Organization will send a team of experts to China next week to investigate the original source of the coronavirus. “We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the organization, said on Monday. , how it was transmitted to humans remains unknown. The outbreak was first identified late last year at a market in Wuhan, China, and one hypothesis is that other poached wildlife sold there might have spread the virus to people. Tedros said it is very important to know the exact zoonotic origin of the virus and understand the science behind it in order to deal with the current pandemic and outbreaks that might occur in the future. delegation led by Dr. and said health officials there were seeing success in suppressing the outbreak. over its initial handling of the outbreak, including delays in reporting the first cases to the W. , and for looking to deflect blame for the epidemic on outsiders. has been reluctant to publicly criticize China, and at times it has praised health officials for providing genetic information about the virus and taking strong action around Wuhan to contain it. Member countries of the organization agreed to investigate the W. for the organization. Tuesday will mark six months since China reported the first cases of the virus to the W. Tedros said that “the worst is yet to come. ” “I am sorry to say that,” he said, “but with this kind of environment and condition, we fear the worst. The House approves a housing relief package. In an effort to intensify pressure on Republicans — and address foreclosure and eviction moratoriums set to expire — House Democrats on Monday approved a stand-alone housing relief package. The provisions in the legislation were initially included in the $3 trillion stimulus bill that the House passed in May, but Senate Republicans have refused to take it up. The legislation, championed by Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California and the House Financial Services Committee, would also allocate more funding to federal housing programs, provide $11. 5 billion for homeless assistance grants and provide billions of dollars to help cover rent, mortgage payments and utility bills. renewed calls to begin negotiating another pandemic relief package amid a continuing surge in cases. , will expire soon without congressional action. Democrats tried to use a procedural maneuver that would allow the legislation to pass the Senate without the full chamber present, but Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, objected, citing concerns that the national debt and deficit would reach “unsustainable levels. The dispute came as Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, slammed Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, for his unwillingness to begin another round of talks. They wrote in a letter to Mr. McConnell that “now is the time for action, not continued delays and political posturing. Though there is widespread acknowledgment on Capitol Hill that another relief package is needed, Mr. McConnell and top Senate Republicans have pushed to delay any negotiations or legislation until after the chamber returns from a two-week July 4 recess. Republicans, however, have repeatedly stressed that Congress should wait before doling out another round of taxpayer aid so they could see the impact of the $2. 2 trillion stimulus package, which became law in March. , but Republicans remain divided over how to balance the need for economic relief with calls to rein in spending. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. “While the Democratic House slapped together an absurd multi-trillion-dollar wish list that even the mainstream media panned immediately, the Senate has continued with our substantive, serious, facts-first approach,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “That is the formula we will replicate in any future recovery legislation down the road. New York City officials agree to a smaller budget, including cuts to the police. Police officers in Manhattan on Sunday. After a shutdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus created a $9 billion revenue shortfall, New York City officials on Monday agreed to an austerity budget that includes drastic cuts to city services and a shift of resources out of the New York Police Department. The gloomy $87 billion budget is nearly $6 billion less than the one the city approved last year. The city will demand across-the-board savings from city agencies, and slash services that city residents have come to rely on, such as eliminating the residential composting program and closing city pools for the summer. Trash pickups will be reduced, and overnight service on the Staten Island Ferry will be curtailed. Fewer police traffic agents will be deployed at intersections, and tree pruning and tree stump removal will be less frequent. Frequent calls among activists to defund the New York Police Department were central to negotiations, as activists sought to pare $1 billion from the police’s $6 billion budget. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council agreed on Monday to reach that $1 billion in cuts by, among other things, canceling the planned hiring of 1,163 police officers. But slightly less than half of the $1 billion in cuts will come from a budgetary sleight of hand: School safety officers, who are currently under the auspices of the Police Department, will be moved to the authority of the Department of Education, according to three Council members familiar with the plan. de Blasio still believes the city needs to find $1 billion in labor savings or face 22,000 layoffs, unless the federal government comes through with aid or the state grants the city borrowing authority, according to Mr. Local lockdowns resume in Australia, as dozens of cases bring fears of a resurgence. Australia, which showed early signs of quashing the coronavirus, is now battling spikes in its second-most-populous state, Victoria, leading the authorities to announce lockdowns in 10 postal codes in the greater Melbourne area from 11:59 p. On Tuesday, the state recorded 60 new cases, its 14th consecutive day of double-digit increases. Thirteen of the cases were linked to known outbreaks, 20 were identified through routine testing and 31 more cases were under investigation, the authorities said. The country of 25 million people reported just seven cases in its other states on Tuesday. The numbers pale in comparison to the United States, which has seen tens of thousands of infections reported in recent days, and other countries struggling to limit the spread of the outbreak. and had been internationally praised for its success in battling the virus. Some states have seen no new cases of the virus for weeks. The spikes in Victoria were partly traced to large family gatherings where people failed to observe social distancing, the authorities said. Public health experts have also criticized the government for failing to communicate restrictions effectively to non-English-speaking neighborhoods in Melbourne. On Tuesday, the state of Queensland said it would open its borders to the rest of Australia on July 10, but would exclude anyone who had been in Victoria in the previous 14 days. South Australia also scrapped plans to open its borders with Victoria on July 20. Drought-stricken Puerto Rico will impose water rationing measures in the middle of the pandemic. The drought-stricken bank of the Rio Grande de Loiza in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico, on Monday. Starting on Thursday, nearly 140,000 customers of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, including some in San Juan, the capital, will be without running water every other day, the utility announced on Monday. Public health experts have repeatedly cited frequent hand washing as key to curbing the coronavirus spread. Puerto Rico has reported 7,250 confirmed and probable coronavirus cases and 153 deaths. “We are aware of how necessary water is as a resource in the Covid-19 pandemic, which is why it is important to continue hygiene measures to protect families,” Doriel Pagán, the executive director of the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, said in a statement. She added that the utility does not know how long the rationing measures may last. Wanda Vázquez declared a state of emergency over the worsening drought conditions. Of the island’s 78 municipalities, 21 are in a severe drought and 29 in a moderate drought, Ms. Earlier this month, other water rationing measures were imposed on more than 16,000 customers in northeastern Puerto Rico. The most parched area is the island’s southwest, which is still recovering from a 6. 4 earthquake in early January. The virus is battering Africa’s growing middle class. The Junction mall in Nairobi, Kenya, this month. About 170 million of Africa’s 1. 3 billion people are classified as middle class. , experts at the World Bank say. But beyond the devastating consequences for the continent’s most vulnerable people, the pandemic is also whittling away at one of Africa’s signature achievements: the growth of its middle class. For the last decade, Africa’s middle class has been pivotal to the educational, political and economic development across the continent. New business owners and entrepreneurs have created jobs that, in turn, gave others a leg up as well. Educated, tech-savvy families and young people with money to spare have fed the demand for consumer goods, called for democratic reforms, expanded the talent pool at all levels of society, and pushed for high-quality schools and health care. About 170 million out of Africa’s 1. 3 billion people are now classified as middle class. But about eight million of them could be thrust into poverty because of the coronavirus and its economic fallout, according to World Data Lab, a research organization. “We have been working hard to build better lives,” James Gichina, a tour van driver, said of his colleagues in the tourist sector. Now, he said, “We have nothing. , a fire erupted in the coronavirus ward of a private hospital in Alexandria on Monday, killing seven patients — six men and one woman — according to the country’s public prosecutor, Gov. for use by the country’s military, its maker said on Monday. CanSino Biologics, a pharmaceutical company based in Tianjin, says it has seen promising results in early trials. , in the latest effort by the government to stamp out a small but stubborn second wave of infections in and around the capital. is set to lift restrictions on pubs, restaurants, hotels, barbershops and salons and other venues on Saturday, but the city of Leicester, in central England, might not be included after a regional outbreak of the virus, the city’s mayor said. in September full-time, The Guardian reported. Broadway will stay dark for the rest of the year. A row of closed theaters in Manhattan in April. Broadway will remain closed for at least the rest of this year, and many shows are signaling that they do not expect a return to the stage until late winter or early spring. The Broadway League said Monday that theater owners and producers are ready to refund or exchange tickets previously purchased for shows through Jan. 3. But, given the unpredictability of the pandemic, the League said it was not yet ready to specify a date when shows will reopen. , and already this has been the longest shutdown in history. Thus far three shows, the Disney musical “Frozen,” a new Martin McDonagh play called “Hangmen,” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” both of which were in previews, have announced that they will not resume performances when Broadway reopens. Several producers have indicated that they are looking several months into 2021 for a resumption of their productions. “Birthday Candles,” a new play by Noah Haidle that had been scheduled to open this spring, will not open until the fall of next year. announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and would seek to do the same in the United States. With productions shuttered, the famed circus said that it had lost its entire revenue stream. , nearly 95 percent of its work force, said that it had entered into a “stalking horse” purchase agreement for existing shareholders to restart the business. players are openly objecting to their return to play. Botafogo, one of the top teams, came out to its first game back carrying a banner protesting the game, and its players laid out their objections on social media. The chairman of another top team has also expressed his reservations. from Park City, Utah, to at least 20 other locales in the United States and, possibly, Mexico. The festival said that its “full curated program” would also be made available online. said that 15 of the 250 players participating in voluntary training sessions have returned positive tests for the virus after being examined at those sessions. Another 11 players, the league said, have tested positive since June 8. Wall Street rebounds, shrugging off the continuing rise in virus cases. A stock trader arriving at the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan on Monday. Stocks rallied Monday, rebounding from a week of losses, even as a resurgence in coronavirus cases that had alarmed Wall Street last week continued to grow. The S&amp;P 500 rose more than 1 percent, after having fallen nearly 3 percent last week. A jump in shares of Boeing helped lead the Dow Jones industrial average to a gain of nearly 2 percent. Shares in Europe had also ended higher, after rebounding from a decline earlier in the day. Companies that have come to reflect investor sentiment toward the return of normal spending by American consumers — retailers and airlines — were among the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Southwest Airlines rose nearly 9 percent, and Simon Property Group, which operates shopping malls, jumped more than 8 percent. And oil prices rose, with West Texas intermediate futures approaching the $40 a barrel mark.

			<data> Los Angeles County, which has been averaging more than 2,000 new cases each day, surpassed 100,000 total cases on Monday. Motorists line up at a coronavirus testing center at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Monday morning. SACRAMENTO — Only a few weeks ago, thousands of Southern Californians were flocking to beaches, Disneyland was announcing it would soon reopen and Whoopi Goldberg was lauding Gov. Gavin Newsom on “The View” for the state’s progress in combating the coronavirus. The worst, many in California thought, was behind them. In fact, an alarming surge in cases up and down the state was only just beginning. Over the past week California’s case count has exploded, surpassing 200,000 known infections, and forcing Mr. Newsom to roll back the state’s reopening in some counties. On Monday, he said the number of people hospitalized in California had risen 43 percent over the past two weeks. Los Angeles County, which has been averaging more than 2,000 new cases each day, surpassed 100,000 total cases on Monday, with the virus actively infecting one in every 140 people, according to local health officials. More than 2,800 cases were announced in the county on Monday, the most of any day during the pandemic. More than 7,000 new cases were announced across California on Monday, its highest single-day total of the pandemic. Newsom shut down the bars in a half-dozen counties, including Los Angeles County and in the Central Valley, and recommended that another eight counties voluntarily close their nightspots and gathering places. And Disneyland has since rescinded its decision to open its gates. California was the first state to shut down and one of the most aggressive in fighting the virus. But the state that was so proactive in combating the spread of the coronavirus is now being forced to ask itself what went wrong. “To some extent I think our luck may have run out,” said Dr. Bob Wachter, a professor and chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “This is faster and worse than I expected. You have to have a ton of respect for this thing. It is nasty and it just lurks and waits to stomp on you if you let your guard down for a second. The head start that California appeared to enjoy — the companies that allowed employees to work from home as early as February, the governor who warned residents in daily briefings to stay home and appeared to be listened to — was not protective enough in the long run. Younger people appear to account for the large surge in new cases, as they have in many other states. And just as in Texas and Florida, the state’s reopening appears to have triggered a large resurgence. Pressured in part by businesses, church groups and conservatives, Mr. Newsom ceded control of much of the timing of reopening to local officials who were eager to regain a sense of normalcy and stem economic losses. The result was a decentralized, haphazard process that sowed confusion and gave residents a false sense that they were in the clear. Unlike people in the Northeast, many Californians did not have a sense of urgency or immediacy toward the virus because infection rates had been so low for months. There were no overflowing morgues or ambulance sirens at all hours. In a state with 40 million people, outbreaks have been heterogeneous: San Quentin State Prison on the San Francisco Bay, food-processing plants in the Central Valley, nursing homes, dense urban neighborhoods filled with essential workers and family gatherings in remote rural communities have all accounted for clusters of cases. But health experts and state officials say the ultimate reasons for the surge lie in the millions of individual decisions made across the vast state. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles blamed “irrational exuberance. “A lot of people didn’t stick with the plan,” the mayor said in an interview on Friday. “The idea was, we would do a move, wait three weeks, check the impact, take the next move. Garcetti said, the reopening “was like a tidal wave — one move led to the next, led to the next, led to the next. And then we had the protest on top of that, and other things. And we have yet to be able to identify where spread is happening and what we can do to crank it down. Patrons outside Figaro Bistrot in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday. State Senator Richard Pan, a Sacramento physician who led the state’s push to tighten immunization requirements, said that the state might have flattened its curve at first, but that it never bent it down toward zero. “How this disease spreads is all about the margins,” Dr. “All it takes is, like, 5 percent more people doing more high-risk behavior to change its direction. Pan blames partisanship and misinformation spread by President Trump. On the weekend after June 20, when bars reopened in Los Angeles County, an estimated 500,000 people visited nightspots. Additionally, half of the restaurants visited by county inspectors are not complying with new public health rules, according to health officials. “I’m frustrated because it’s not that we don’t know what to do,” Dr. “We know what to do. We’re just not doing it. California was one of the earliest states to get hit by the virus.

Cellphone data showed that Californians moved around less than people in other states, and infection rates stabilized at a plateau well below the levels experts had projected, making military field hospitals and sports arenas and auditoriums — all mobilized in case of a shortage of beds — unnecessary. By May, with low case counts remaining steady, Mr. Newsom was coming under increasing pressure to reopen. Dhillon, a civil rights attorney and member of the Republican National Committee, filed more than a dozen lawsuits related to the reopening. If residents could congregate at Costco, they should be able to go to church, she argued. out of California. Newsom localized the reopening process, allowing counties to move at different speeds, repeatedly declaring that “localism is determinative,” and vowing to collaborate with county governments, not issue orders. Church congregations were allowed to meet with restrictions. Advocates for reopening like Ms. Dhillon felt vindicated. “I feel that our lawsuits were responsible for large sectors of California’s economy opening up much sooner than the governor originally intended,” she said, adding that she fielded countless calls from business owners. “People are absolutely devastated. Newsom was also criticized by those who worried the state was reopening too quickly. Sara Cody, the chief health officer of Santa Clara County and the architect of the Bay Area’s stay-at-home orders, said the system was bewildering to residents who cross county lines regularly. “For the public it’s incredibly confusing,” Dr. Cody said in an interview. “What’s the message? How can it be that something is OK here and in the adjoining county it’s not? The measures have become even more disparate in the past few weeks. In Napa and Sonoma Counties, wine tastings and restaurant meals are permitted both indoors and outside. In San Francisco, restaurant dining is only available outdoors. Mayor London Breed of San Francisco announced last week that the city would postpone the reopening, scheduled for Monday, of hair and nail salons, massage shops, museums, tattoo parlors and outdoor bars. Diana Dooley, a former state secretary of Health and Human Services who dealt with the Ebola and Zika pandemics during her tenure, said she had watched “with great empathy” as the crisis gripped California. Initially, she said, “it looked like the Bay Area was driving the decisions. ” And as the virus spread, Californians were generally compliant. “But after several months, the impatient people have made top-down orders very hard to enforce,” she said. The result, she said, is a sense in some parts of the state of “a kind of liberty gone rampant. “People want to go to bars, they want to go to picnics,” she said. “These protest rallies have heightened that sense of ‘I want to be in a crowd. ’ We’re coming up on the Fourth of July and people want to be in connection with each other. “You can only lead if people follow,” Ms. “Newsom has done a pretty good job of creating awareness, and people in California are more inclined to believe this is serious. But what they can do about it, we’re still getting to. David Townsend, a veteran Democratic political consultant in the state, said California’s size and political complexity pose a considerable challenge. Although the Legislature is overwhelmingly Democratic, more than a fifth of the electorate is Republican. “You have the Inland Empire doing one thing, Los Angeles doing another, Orange County — it’s pretty hard to corral everybody in California and get them to do the right thing. It’s just so big. Townsend said the pressure would be tough for any governor. “How do you put the genie back into the bottle? “I’m not sure there’s much more he can do.

You have to have a ton of respect for this thing. It is nasty and it just lurks and waits to stomp on you if you let your guard down for a second. The head start that California appeared to enjoy — the companies that allowed employees to work from home as early as February, the governor who warned residents in daily briefings to stay home and appeared to be listened to — was not protective enough in the long run. Younger people appear to account for the large surge in new cases, as they have in many other states. And just as in Texas and Florida, the state’s reopening appears to have triggered a large resurgence. Pressured in part by businesses, church groups and conservatives, Mr. Newsom ceded control of much of the timing of reopening to local officials who were eager to regain a sense of normalcy and stem economic losses. The result was a decentralized, haphazard process that sowed confusion and gave residents a false sense that they were in the clear. Unlike people in the Northeast, many Californians did not have a sense of urgency or immediacy toward the virus because infection rates had been so low for months. There were no overflowing morgues or ambulance sirens at all hours. In a state with 40 million people, outbreaks have been heterogeneous: San Quentin State Prison on the San Francisco Bay, food-processing plants in the Central Valley, nursing homes, dense urban neighborhoods filled with essential workers and family gatherings in remote rural communities have all accounted for clusters of cases. But health experts and state officials say the ultimate reasons for the surge lie in the millions of individual decisions made across the vast state. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles blamed “irrational exuberance. “A lot of people didn’t stick with the plan,” the mayor said in an interview on Friday. “The idea was, we would do a move, wait three weeks, check the impact, take the next move. Garcetti said, the reopening “was like a tidal wave — one move led to the next, led to the next, led to the next. And then we had the protest on top of that, and other things. And we have yet to be able to identify where spread is happening and what we can do to crank it down. Patrons outside Figaro Bistrot in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday. State Senator Richard Pan, a Sacramento physician who led the state’s push to tighten immunization requirements, said that the state might have flattened its curve at first, but that it never bent it down toward zero. “How this disease spreads is all about the margins,” Dr. “All it takes is, like, 5 percent more people doing more high-risk behavior to change its direction. Pan blames partisanship and misinformation spread by President Trump. On the weekend after June 20, when bars reopened in Los Angeles County, an estimated 500,000 people visited nightspots. Additionally, half of the restaurants visited by county inspectors are not complying with new public health rules, according to health officials. “I’m frustrated because it’s not that we don’t know what to do,” Dr. “We know what to do. We’re just not doing it. California was one of the earliest states to get hit by the virus. Soon after it first appeared on American shores, Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, was considered a major hot spot, seeded by travelers arriving from China. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. on March 16, followed by a statewide order three days later. Cellphone data showed that Californians moved around less than people in other states, and infection rates stabilized at a plateau well below the levels experts had projected, making military field hospitals and sports arenas and auditoriums — all mobilized in case of a shortage of beds — unnecessary. By May, with low case counts remaining steady, Mr. Newsom was coming under increasing pressure to reopen. Dhillon, a civil rights attorney and member of the Republican National Committee, filed more than a dozen lawsuits related to the reopening. If residents could congregate at Costco, they should be able to go to church, she argued. out of California. Newsom localized the reopening process, allowing counties to move at different speeds, repeatedly declaring that “localism is determinative,” and vowing to collaborate with county governments, not issue orders. Church congregations were allowed to meet with restrictions. Advocates for reopening like Ms. Dhillon felt vindicated. “I feel that our lawsuits were responsible for large sectors of California’s economy opening up much sooner than the governor originally intended,” she said, adding that she fielded countless calls from business owners. “People are absolutely devastated. Newsom was also criticized by those who worried the state was reopening too quickly. Sara Cody, the chief health officer of Santa Clara County and the architect of the Bay Area’s stay-at-home orders, said the system was bewildering to residents who cross county lines regularly. “For the public it’s incredibly confusing,” Dr. Cody said in an interview. “What’s the message? How can it be that something is OK here and in the adjoining county it’s not? The measures have become even more disparate in the past few weeks. In Napa and Sonoma Counties, wine tastings and restaurant meals are permitted both indoors and outside. In San Francisco, restaurant dining is only available outdoors. Mayor London Breed of San Francisco announced last week that the city would postpone the reopening, scheduled for Monday, of hair and nail salons, massage shops, museums, tattoo parlors and outdoor bars. Diana Dooley, a former state secretary of Health and Human Services who dealt with the Ebola and Zika pandemics during her tenure, said she had watched “with great empathy” as the crisis gripped California. Initially, she said, “it looked like the Bay Area was driving the decisions. ” And as the virus spread, Californians were generally compliant. “But after several months, the impatient people have made top-down orders very hard to enforce,” she said. The result, she said, is a sense in some parts of the state of “a kind of liberty gone rampant. “People want to go to bars, they want to go to picnics,” she said. “These protest rallies have heightened that sense of ‘I want to be in a crowd. ’ We’re coming up on the Fourth of July and people want to be in connection with each other. “You can only lead if people follow,” Ms. “Newsom has done a pretty good job of creating awareness, and people in California are more inclined to believe this is serious. But what they can do about it, we’re still getting to. David Townsend, a veteran Democratic political consultant in the state, said California’s size and political complexity pose a considerable challenge. Although the Legislature is overwhelmingly Democratic, more than a fifth of the electorate is Republican. “You have the Inland Empire doing one thing, Los Angeles doing another, Orange County — it’s pretty hard to corral everybody in California and get them to do the right thing. It’s just so big. Townsend said the pressure would be tough for any governor. “How do you put the genie back into the bottle? “I’m not sure there’s much more he can do.

A billboard promoting China’s national security law in Hong Kong on Monday. China passed a contentious new law for Hong Kong on Tuesday that would empower the authorities to crack down on opposition to Beijing, risking deeper rifts with Western governments that have warned about the erosion of freedoms in the territory. after the territory was convulsed by pro-democracy protests last year. The law underscores Beijing’s resolve to achieve a political sea change in Hong Kong, a former British colony with its own legal system and civil liberties absent in mainland China. It could be used to stifle protests like those that last year evolved into an increasingly confrontational, and sometimes violent, challenge to Chinese rule.

The details of the law had not been disclosed as of Tuesday afternoon. Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s representative to the top legislative body in China that reviewed the law, confirmed its passage on Tuesday. “Those who have stirred up trouble and broken this type of law in the past will hopefully watch themselves in the future,” Mr. Tam said in a television interview. “If they continue to defy the law, they will bear the consequences. Opposition politicians quickly criticized the law for its power to silence dissent.

			<data> Remote School Is a Nightmare. Few in Power Care. Remote School Is a Nightmare. Few in Power Care. Government should treat the need to reopen schools as an emergency. Scott Stringer, the comptroller of New York City, has sons who are 7 and 8 years old. Over the last three months, like many parents, he’s tried to navigate what schools are optimistically calling “remote learning” while he and his wife both worked from home. It’s been, he told me, “one of the most challenging things I ever had to do in my life. So when he hears from parents desperate to understand what’s happening with schools in September, he empathizes. As in many other cities, if New York public schools reopen, students will likely be in the classroom only part-time. But no one knows if that means that students will attend on alternate days, alternate weeks or — Stringer’s preference — in half-day shifts. to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, last week. With expanded unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of July, many parents will have no choice but to return to work by September. and family relationships. , especially for poor, black and Hispanic students. ‘Things Are Getting Annoying. The lessons they learned while parenting in place. There we go. There we go. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’re the Pauls. We’re the Orangos. We are at the Carter-McLaughlin-Milstein family. Or Mill Carterstein McDonlaughlinsons. We spent the first three weeks just butting heads. I don’t keep track anymore. Everything’s blurred together. Being a naturally rather bossy person, like, I was looking to control what I can control, and so there is, like, it sets up an inherent conflict. At this point, things are getting annoying. I’m a single dad. I’m a chief revenue officer in a technology company. Yeah, that sounds — that sounds good. I’m sort of applying what I would in terms of management at work into my home structure with my kids, who have never seen me in that mode before. He thinks we are his team, but we’re not. You are my home team. Yeah, and we’re not used to it. You’re my home team. But this is not how — OK. This is not we work. So so — We can’t work like this. He thinks we’re not during our work and we’re just reading when we’re really reading for school. I’ll see her sort of lounging back on the couch. What are you doing? Reading a book. She’s doing what she’s supposed to be doing, but to me visually it sort of looks like she’s just lounging. He doesn’t know what we’re doing at all. I look at your agenda every morning. Most of the times. Before quarantine, our dad would do this thing where he would live his life with these three principles — honesty, integrity and purpose. Meaning, like, he wants to do meditation. Now we get dragged into it. This is, like, a goal that I want for them. But we don’t have any interest in this. No shared interest here. I’ll tell you what, I do have a swear jar, and there’s way, way more money in that swear jar than — Oh, you’ve kept up with that? There’s a lot of cash in there now, because I don’t know what you guys are hearing anymore. Most of the fighting that went on in this house was the boss and my son. My son was away in college, and I think he didn’t understand the severity of the situation. Kind of a hard adjustment. Like, I had a lot of freedom and independence. I could what I want, when I wanted, whenever I wanted, and then, when I came home, it was kind of like going back to listening to Mom and Dad. I want to go out. You can’t go out. We’re in a global pandemic. I was like, maybe it was better when he was back in his dorm. She’s the boss, so I’ll follow the rules, too, you know? I’ve been following the rules for 20 years now. The first rule is, we all have to have dinner together. We’re your typical New York family. You know, everybody is sitting at the table with a little frown on their face. Since we’re all together in the house all day, like, there isn’t really much to talk about. She’s like, watching, like, TikToks, because she’s obsessed with the app. I don’t watch TikTok at dinner. My second rule is — more pertains to Skye. She does remote learning in her bedroom and I do teaching out in our living room space, and so I ask her if she needs any help to come into my space. And it’s so funny. Sometimes I will walk by her room and she’s like, Bro, you just walked past my door. Why can’t you just come to me? But she doesn’t realize that it’s, like, either I quickly took a bathroom break, I quickly went to get something from my bedroom, but I need to get back to where I was at. So I’ll make her come out, and she’s literally like — Why can’t you just come over to me, and why do you have to make this rule? My mom has a rule that nobody can come into her space, but she comes into my space all the time, unwanted and unasked for. What are you doing? So I’ll come in the room, and then I’ll sit. What just happened? Why are you sitting down? She’s always like, smiling, wanting to, like, kiss me and hug me all the time. What are you doing? Let me look at that face. This is absolutely just a parenting nightmare. I’m Christine, and I live with my daughters Amalia, Fiona and Macy. Macy’s my stepdaughter. You can cut my hair after, if I can cut yours. This is actually not Mark, this is Mike. Mike is my first husband. And I live within a mile down the road with my wife, Tanya, and my stepdaughter Sophie. So because there’s four parents and five kids, it has really complicated how we shelter in place. So we’re always dealing with new things that the kids are always bringing up on, how about if I can do this? How about if I can do that? First, a kid will come forward with a proposal. We actually call them proposals. It did remind me of when I was in middle school and I had to, like, ask my parents’ permission before I could go anywhere. You know, it really could have been the four parents against the five kids. I have this idea that my family doesn’t understand when they do understand, and so I just kind of take it out on them. It was like, you don’t get me. I think it was a lot harder at first to really be empathetic and to listen to the kids’ concerns and to sort of see that the ways in which they are suffering are really different than the ways that we are struggling. The first time that I had my best friend over, we had set up this entire protocol. I was all the way over here, and she was all the way back here. So we were pretty far apart. And my brother Tanner, who is 17, he sits directly next to her. They had made, like, a big case that they didn’t need to be watched or policed, but then, there I was watching them, and I saw it happen and came out. She’s super mad and is saying, you’re not six feet away, and everything, and got so mad. It was quite a scene. I really had the time to come around and realize that my actions will affect people in our joint family who, you know, I never really see on a daily basis. You know, I’m taking care of them, and I’m still working, so I’ve kind of had to lay off of myself and not put external pressures to be some type of, I don’t know, Betty Crocker quarantine mom, because I’m not, at all. Even though it’s been, I think, more work up front to come together, it’s resulted for us as a family in a lot less conflict. And the truth is, I’ve also really put to the test, like, how patient I am, how patient they are with me. How was that noodle lunch? What’s another word for disgusting? And I think we — again, nine weeks into this quarantine, I think — It feels like — I don’t even know. It feels like a lifetime ago when I could actually have a sleepover with my friends. So it just boils down to sleepover. I don’t think they heard a word I just said. The lessons they learned while parenting in place. Yet the nightmarish withdrawal of the key social support underlying modern parenthood is being presented as a fait accompli, rather than a worst-case scenario that government is mobilizing to prevent. “This school system should be leading the country on figuring out how to bring our kids back,” said Stringer. “And there’s no creativity. There’s no energy behind it. This isn’t just a New York City problem. At every level, government is failing kids and parents during the pandemic. , which means far fewer kids in most classrooms. But there’s been no crash program to find or build new classroom space, or to hire more teachers. Few seem to be exploring the possibility of outdoor classes where weather allows. Experts I spoke to knew of no plans to scale up child care for parents who will need it. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, described school districts as “immobilized” by lack of funding. Reopening schools is an excruciating challenge, but more could be done to rise to it. “There’s a missed creative opportunity to use a different teaching force,” said Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University and author of “Expecting Better” and “Cribsheet. — as something like camp counselors. Kids, kept in pods, would attend schools for part of the day, then move to a space where counselors could oversee online learning or recess. “Those things cost money, but having a bunch of kids lose out on their learning and having their parents not go to work also costs money,” she said. There’s some evidence that young kids don’t transmit the coronavirus at the same rate as adults. have been traced to elementary schools. , there have been no reported clusters at the child care centers that stayed open all over the country this spring to watch the children of essential workers. that “all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school. ” Schools, it says, “should weigh the benefits of strict adherence to a six-feet spacing rule between students with the potential downside if remote learning is the only alternative. But many teachers, understandably, aren’t willing to jettison C. So if American kids, unlike those in most other developed countries, continue to see their education derailed by the coronavirus, the fault lies primarily with a federal government that puts out safety standards but won’t help schools meet them. Weingarten tells me that if the Senate doesn’t pass the HEROES Act, a House bill that contains around $100 billion in support for education, she thinks many schools, including those in New York City, won’t open at all in September. To open safely, schools are going to need much more money to buy protective equipment like gloves and masks, retrofit buildings and hire more teachers and nurses. Instead, the economic crisis is forcing budget cuts. “What are states going to do? What are localities going to do? My kids go to elementary school in New York City, and I found Weingarten’s words gutting. But she thinks school districts need to start leveling with parents about what we’re facing, unless Republicans in the Senate can somehow be moved to act. “At least plan with people so that people can get their heads around ‘This is what a school will look like,’” she said. “‘This is what the schedule will be. And if we don’t get the money we’re on remote. ’” Airlines got a bailout. Parents are on their own. Remote School Is a Nightmare. Few in Power Care. Government should treat the need to reopen schools as an emergency. Scott Stringer, the comptroller of New York City, has sons who are 7 and 8 years old. Over the last three months, like many parents, he’s tried to navigate what schools are optimistically calling “remote learning” while he and his wife both worked from home. It’s been, he told me, “one of the most challenging things I ever had to do in my life. So when he hears from parents desperate to understand what’s happening with schools in September, he empathizes. As in many other cities, if New York public schools reopen, students will likely be in the classroom only part-time. But no one knows if that means that students will attend on alternate days, alternate weeks or — Stringer’s preference — in half-day shifts. to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, last week. With expanded unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of July, many parents will have no choice but to return to work by September. and family relationships. , especially for poor, black and Hispanic students. ‘Things Are Getting Annoying. The lessons they learned while parenting in place. There we go. There we go. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’re the Pauls. We’re the Orangos. We are at the Carter-McLaughlin-Milstein family. Or Mill Carterstein McDonlaughlinsons. We spent the first three weeks just butting heads. I don’t keep track anymore. Everything’s blurred together. Being a naturally rather bossy person, like, I was looking to control what I can control, and so there is, like, it sets up an inherent conflict. At this point, things are getting annoying. I’m a single dad. I’m a chief revenue officer in a technology company. Yeah, that sounds — that sounds good. I’m sort of applying what I would in terms of management at work into my home structure with my kids, who have never seen me in that mode before. He thinks we are his team, but we’re not. You are my home team. Yeah, and we’re not used to it. You’re my home team. But this is not how — OK. This is not we work. So so — We can’t work like this. He thinks we’re not during our work and we’re just reading when we’re really reading for school. I’ll see her sort of lounging back on the couch. What are you doing? Reading a book. She’s doing what she’s supposed to be doing, but to me visually it sort of looks like she’s just lounging. He doesn’t know what we’re doing at all. I look at your agenda every morning. Most of the times. Before quarantine, our dad would do this thing where he would live his life with these three principles — honesty, integrity and purpose. Meaning, like, he wants to do meditation. Now we get dragged into it. This is, like, a goal that I want for them. But we don’t have any interest in this. No shared interest here. I’ll tell you what, I do have a swear jar, and there’s way, way more money in that swear jar than — Oh, you’ve kept up with that? There’s a lot of cash in there now, because I don’t know what you guys are hearing anymore. Most of the fighting that went on in this house was the boss and my son. My son was away in college, and I think he didn’t understand the severity of the situation. Kind of a hard adjustment. Like, I had a lot of freedom and independence. I could what I want, when I wanted, whenever I wanted, and then, when I came home, it was kind of like going back to listening to Mom and Dad. I want to go out. You can’t go out. We’re in a global pandemic. I was like, maybe it was better when he was back in his dorm. She’s the boss, so I’ll follow the rules, too, you know? I’ve been following the rules for 20 years now. The first rule is, we all have to have dinner together. We’re your typical New York family. You know, everybody is sitting at the table with a little frown on their face. Since we’re all together in the house all day, like, there isn’t really much to talk about. She’s like, watching, like, TikToks, because she’s obsessed with the app. I don’t watch TikTok at dinner. My second rule is — more pertains to Skye. She does remote learning in her bedroom and I do teaching out in our living room space, and so I ask her if she needs any help to come into my space. And it’s so funny. Sometimes I will walk by her room and she’s like, Bro, you just walked past my door. Why can’t you just come to me? But she doesn’t realize that it’s, like, either I quickly took a bathroom break, I quickly went to get something from my bedroom, but I need to get back to where I was at. So I’ll make her come out, and she’s literally like — Why can’t you just come over to me, and why do you have to make this rule? My mom has a rule that nobody can come into her space, but she comes into my space all the time, unwanted and unasked for. What are you doing? So I’ll come in the room, and then I’ll sit. What just happened? Why are you sitting down? She’s always like, smiling, wanting to, like, kiss me and hug me all the time. What are you doing? Let me look at that face. This is absolutely just a parenting nightmare. I’m Christine, and I live with my daughters Amalia, Fiona and Macy. Macy’s my stepdaughter. You can cut my hair after, if I can cut yours. This is actually not Mark, this is Mike. Mike is my first husband. And I live within a mile down the road with my wife, Tanya, and my stepdaughter Sophie. So because there’s four parents and five kids, it has really complicated how we shelter in place. So we’re always dealing with new things that the kids are always bringing up on, how about if I can do this? How about if I can do that? First, a kid will come forward with a proposal. We actually call them proposals. It did remind me of when I was in middle school and I had to, like, ask my parents’ permission before I could go anywhere. You know, it really could have been the four parents against the five kids. I have this idea that my family doesn’t understand when they do understand, and so I just kind of take it out on them. It was like, you don’t get me. I think it was a lot harder at first to really be empathetic and to listen to the kids’ concerns and to sort of see that the ways in which they are suffering are really different than the ways that we are struggling. The first time that I had my best friend over, we had set up this entire protocol. I was all the way over here, and she was all the way back here. So we were pretty far apart. And my brother Tanner, who is 17, he sits directly next to her. They had made, like, a big case that they didn’t need to be watched or policed, but then, there I was watching them, and I saw it happen and came out. She’s super mad and is saying, you’re not six feet away, and everything, and got so mad. It was quite a scene. I really had the time to come around and realize that my actions will affect people in our joint family who, you know, I never really see on a daily basis. You know, I’m taking care of them, and I’m still working, so I’ve kind of had to lay off of myself and not put external pressures to be some type of, I don’t know, Betty Crocker quarantine mom, because I’m not, at all.

			<data> Business Embraces Hong Kong Security Law. The Money Helps. Business Embraces Hong Kong Security Law. The Money Helps. A flood of investment from China has tempered worries that Beijing’s tightening grip on the Asian financial capital would end its status as a lucrative place to do business. A sunset view of the Hong Kong skyline on Monday, the day before Chinese officials imposed a new national security law on the former British colony. HONG KONG — The business world has largely fallen in line behind China’s campaign to tighten its grip on Hong Kong, including its support for a new national security law that many residents fear will hurt the former British colony’s status as a laissez-faire, freethinking city. to punish any global company or local tycoon who crosses it. But China has also won over some business hearts and minds — and a big new inflow of Chinese money into the territory has helped it make its case. The money, totaling billions of dollars in new stock offerings and property deals by blue-chip Chinese companies in the past few weeks alone, have bolstered perceptions in the business world that Hong Kong will remain a deeply profitable place to do business for years to come. In Hong Kong’s gleaming skyscrapers and wood-paneled conference rooms, many bankers and deal makers discussed their views only on condition of anonymity — less for fear of angering Beijing, and more out of concern about wading into a broader geopolitical showdown between the United States and China. “The business community is a cheerleader,” said Fraser Howie, an author and former banker who writes about China’s financial system. “They have compartmentalized that, somehow, ‘I do business, not politics. Chinese lawmakers in Beijing passed the law early on Tuesday, though by midday its text still had not been released publicly. that it will allow a security agency to be placed in Hong Kong to put out any signs of dissent in the territory. Hong Kong’s top official will also be given the power to appoint judges to hear certain security-related cases, raising alarms about the erosion of Hong Kong’s once coveted independent judiciary. In retaliation, the Trump administration and some American lawmakers have threatened to revoke the trade privileges the United States extends to Hong Kong. on American exports of defense equipment and some high-technology products to Hong Kong. Hong Kong residents who broadly oppose Beijing’s clampdown have waited nervously for weeks to find out what the law says. In that period, new Chinese deals have reassured many in the business world that Hong Kong will remain a great place to make a deal. 9 billion last week by selling shares on Hong Kong’s stock exchange. Just two weeks before, NetEase, a Chinese online game company, raised $2. 7 billion in its own Hong Kong offering. Chinese renters have also helped the property market, which took a hit after the antigovernment protests began a year ago. Alibaba, the e-commerce giant and JD. com rival, and ByteDance, the parent company of the video app TikTok, recently signed leases for pricey new office space, according to industry insiders, who asked to remain anonymous because such deals are typically private. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. Those deals follow others in previous months that amounted to endorsements by China Inc. , Ping An, a state-controlled Chinese insurance giant, paid $5. 4 billion for unbuilt property atop the high speed train station in the city’s West Kowloon district. in its own Hong Kong stock offering. head of research at Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services company. There is little evidence that the money flows represent a targeted, Beijing-led charm offensive to make the national security law more palatable. Chinese state-owned companies and others from the mainland have been increasing their Hong Kong investments for years, eclipsing international money and local tycoons alike. With Chinese companies looking elsewhere to raise money from international investors, Jefferies, the investment bank, has predicted nearly $600 billion could flow into Hong Kong over the next year. “As a direct result of the enforcement landscape in the U. S., a lot of Chinese companies are reorienting their business practices to raise money in Hong Kong,” said Shaun Wu, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings. to return home. Hong Kong regulators recently issued new rules that make it easier for Chinese companies to list in the city and give more control to the companies. Shareholder activists have criticized the moves as undermining Hong Kong’s legal and corporate governance system. Big Chinese investors have replaced local tycoons and British trading houses as owners of iconic skyscrapers that dot Hong Kong’s skyline. Today, around 5 percent of these buildings are owned and occupied by Chinese firms, according to an estimate by Colliers. Protesters hold flags as they march through a shopping mall during a protest against the new national security law in Hong Kong on June 12th. Investment bankers and deal makers say the continual flow of new Chinese money and other efforts have helped Beijing make its case that Hong Kong will remain competitive. This month officials in Hong Kong made public a pledge by Chinese regulators to support Hong Kong’s currency if money suddenly fled the territory, making explicit a guarantee that the financial world had only assumed to be true. to its steepest fall in five years. Since then it has regained lost ground, with some help from Chinese investors. and accelerated after plans to impose the national security law were announced. American retaliation remains a question mark. Hong Kong’s status as a financial hub depends on its access to the global financial system. Any move by Washington to limit Hong Kong’s access to American dollars could irreparably damage the territory. So far, Trump administration warnings have focused instead on trade. Removing Hong Kong’s special status would subject goods moving through the territory’s ports to the same high tariffs and other barriers the United States imposes on mainland China. But Hong Kong’s status as a trade hub has declined, and bankers say American retaliation would have little impact on their work. Business support for the new law is not full-throated. Much of it is still motivated by fear of Beijing. and China’s state-controlled media have warned HSBC, the London-based bank with a history in Hong Kong that dates back to the Opium Wars, that Chinese banking customers could go elsewhere if it does not accede to Beijing’s wishes. that they need to keep their employees from joining the pro-democracy movement. Some in the business world still worry that the law will ultimately put them in danger and have sped up their plans to move regional headquarters in the coming years. In one poll by the American Chamber of Commerce, about 40 percent of business people said they would consider moving in light of China’s national security law. Some are already in the process of leaving. Luxury brands have shrunk their presence, scaling back both retail space and office space. The vacancy rate for commercial office space is 7. 4 percent, its highest in Hong Kong since the depths of the global financial crisis in September 2009, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the real estate group. To assuage fears and stem a possible exodus, local financial authorities renewed a push this month to woo foreign investors. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory’s central bank, updated a so-called pitch book that it gives to global financial industry players that are considering moving to the city. The 17-page pamphlet emphasizes Hong Kong’s “common law system familiar to international investors. Among the top features authorities have promoted in the pamphlet is Hong Kong’s access to the mainland’s deep pool of money. Hong Kong, it tells prospective investors in the city, is “by far the dominant gateway to China opportunities. Business Embraces Hong Kong Security Law. The Money Helps.

Just two weeks before, NetEase, a Chinese online game company, raised $2. 7 billion in its own Hong Kong offering. Chinese renters have also helped the property market, which took a hit after the antigovernment protests began a year ago. Alibaba, the e-commerce giant and JD. com rival, and ByteDance, the parent company of the video app TikTok, recently signed leases for pricey new office space, according to industry insiders, who asked to remain anonymous because such deals are typically private. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. Those deals follow others in previous months that amounted to endorsements by China Inc. , Ping An, a state-controlled Chinese insurance giant, paid $5. 4 billion for unbuilt property atop the high speed train station in the city’s West Kowloon district. in its own Hong Kong stock offering. head of research at Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate services company. There is little evidence that the money flows represent a targeted, Beijing-led charm offensive to make the national security law more palatable. Chinese state-owned companies and others from the mainland have been increasing their Hong Kong investments for years, eclipsing international money and local tycoons alike. With Chinese companies looking elsewhere to raise money from international investors, Jefferies, the investment bank, has predicted nearly $600 billion could flow into Hong Kong over the next year. “As a direct result of the enforcement landscape in the U. S., a lot of Chinese companies are reorienting their business practices to raise money in Hong Kong,” said Shaun Wu, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings. to return home. Hong Kong regulators recently issued new rules that make it easier for Chinese companies to list in the city and give more control to the companies. Shareholder activists have criticized the moves as undermining Hong Kong’s legal and corporate governance system. Big Chinese investors have replaced local tycoons and British trading houses as owners of iconic skyscrapers that dot Hong Kong’s skyline. Today, around 5 percent of these buildings are owned and occupied by Chinese firms, according to an estimate by Colliers. Protesters hold flags as they march through a shopping mall during a protest against the new national security law in Hong Kong on June 12th. Investment bankers and deal makers say the continual flow of new Chinese money and other efforts have helped Beijing make its case that Hong Kong will remain competitive. This month officials in Hong Kong made public a pledge by Chinese regulators to support Hong Kong’s currency if money suddenly fled the territory, making explicit a guarantee that the financial world had only assumed to be true. to its steepest fall in five years. Since then it has regained lost ground, with some help from Chinese investors. and accelerated after plans to impose the national security law were announced. American retaliation remains a question mark. Hong Kong’s status as a financial hub depends on its access to the global financial system. Any move by Washington to limit Hong Kong’s access to American dollars could irreparably damage the territory. So far, Trump administration warnings have focused instead on trade. Removing Hong Kong’s special status would subject goods moving through the territory’s ports to the same high tariffs and other barriers the United States imposes on mainland China. But Hong Kong’s status as a trade hub has declined, and bankers say American retaliation would have little impact on their work. Business support for the new law is not full-throated. Much of it is still motivated by fear of Beijing. and China’s state-controlled media have warned HSBC, the London-based bank with a history in Hong Kong that dates back to the Opium Wars, that Chinese banking customers could go elsewhere if it does not accede to Beijing’s wishes. that they need to keep their employees from joining the pro-democracy movement. Some in the business world still worry that the law will ultimately put them in danger and have sped up their plans to move regional headquarters in the coming years. In one poll by the American Chamber of Commerce, about 40 percent of business people said they would consider moving in light of China’s national security law. Some are already in the process of leaving. Luxury brands have shrunk their presence, scaling back both retail space and office space. The vacancy rate for commercial office space is 7. 4 percent, its highest in Hong Kong since the depths of the global financial crisis in September 2009, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the real estate group. To assuage fears and stem a possible exodus, local financial authorities renewed a push this month to woo foreign investors. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory’s central bank, updated a so-called pitch book that it gives to global financial industry players that are considering moving to the city. The 17-page pamphlet emphasizes Hong Kong’s “common law system familiar to international investors. Among the top features authorities have promoted in the pamphlet is Hong Kong’s access to the mainland’s deep pool of money. Hong Kong, it tells prospective investors in the city, is “by far the dominant gateway to China opportunities.</data>

			<data> The mayor and City Council pared $1 billion in funding for the Police Department, but nearly half of that would come from budgetary sleight of hand. City officials were under intense pressure to reduce the Police Department budget. Bowing to political pressure and a bleak fiscal reality that evoked municipal crises of decades past, New York City officials on Monday agreed to an austerity budget that includes drastic cuts to city services and a $1 billion shift of resources out of the New York Police Department. lives in the city. The shutdown helped control the spread of the virus, but it also created a $9 billion revenue shortfall that will have a sharp impact on New Yorkers’ lives. Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, had already shrunk estimated spending by $7. 4 billion this year, but needed to find another $1 billion in savings before the city’s July 1 budget deadline for the coming fiscal year. The gloomy $87 billion budget is nearly $6 billion less than the one the city approved last year. That effort came to include Mr. activists’ calls to cut $1 billion from the department’s $6 billion operating budget. The mayor and the City Council agreed on Monday to reach that $1 billion in cuts by, among other things, canceling the planned hiring of 1,163 police officers. But slightly less than half of the $1 billion in cuts will come from a budgetary sleight of hand: School safety officers, who are currently under the auspices of the Police Department, will be moved to the authority of the Department of Education, according to three council members familiar with the plan. de Blasio still believes the city needs to find $1 billion in labor savings or face 22,000 layoffs, unless the federal government comes through with aid or the state grants the city borrowing authority, according to Mr. The budget is expected to be passed on Tuesday by the full 51-member City Council, although it is expected to garner more than a dozen “no” votes, split between council members who oppose cutting police funding at a time when crime is rising and those who think the police cuts do not go far enough. Councilman Ben Kallos, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side, said he planned to vote no on the budget, in part because he said the police cuts were insufficient. “It is worse than it was before,” Mr. Kallos said in an interview. “We are not seeing a meaningful reduction in head count and the changes that people are literally marching in the streets for,” he said. “I don’t think anyone marching for Black Lives Matter is doing it to see school safety agents moved from the N. D. budget to the schools budget. Councilman Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he would also vote against the budget because he said the changes to Police Department funding were not “real meaningful cuts. ” Among other things, he is skeptical that the department will actually achieve $350 million in overtime reduction costs, as the city has argued will happen. The redistribution of Police Department resources to other departments achieves political and possibly policy ends, but will do little to close the city’s yawning budget gap. To close that gap, the city will demand across-the-board savings from city agencies, and slash services that city residents have come to rely on, such as eliminating the residential composting program and closing city pools for the summer. Trash pickups will be reduced, and overnight service on the Staten Island Ferry will be curtailed. Fewer police traffic agents will be deployed at intersections, and tree pruning and tree stump removal will be less frequent. in his tenure, the mayor drew down on the city’s reserves, tapping $4 billion in savings to help balance the budget, much of it from the retiree health benefits fund, a move that does not affect retiree benefits in the short term. But the budget is expected to restore more than $100 million in funding for youth programs that was cut under the mayor’s executive budget, according to a council member. Goldstein, the mayor’s spokeswoman, declined to confirm that number. “The mayor had two goals for this budget: maintain safety and invest in youth and our hardest-hit communities — all while facing the toughest fiscal situation the city has seen in decades,” Ms. “We believe we presented a plan that accomplishes that mission and look forward to working with the Council to pass a budget that helps this city rebuild stronger. Cuomo, a Democrat, and the State Legislature have declined to give New York City the authority to borrow money to pay for operating costs, even though the state has granted that authority to the state’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and to itself. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. “The New York City bond ratings went up in the last 12 months, for God sakes, this is not the 1970s,” the mayor said on Monday, shortly before Mr. Cuomo invoked the 1970s as a rationale for why he was reluctant to grant the borrowing authority to New York City. de Blasio has not provided a detailed enough plan about how he would use the borrowed money, said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Democratic majority in the State Senate. After speaking with Senate Democrats on Monday, Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller and a 2021 mayoral candidate, agreed. “The mayor has requested $7 billion and now $5 billion in borrowing authority without providing data or rationale,” Mr. Stringer, a Democrat, said in a statement. “Our children do not owe the mayor a blank check. The city’s budget has grown drastically under Mr. from roughly $73 billion in 2014. Budget hawks at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan civic group, have argued that Mr. de Blasio is ignoring other levers at his disposal that are politically difficult to pull but that preclude burdening future generations with having to repay long-term debt. In addition to the possible layoffs, the mayor could cut some 9,000 jobs through attrition from the city’s work force of nearly 330,000, whose head count has expanded some 30,000 since Mr. de Blasio took office. He could also negotiate with labor to require more employees to contribute to their health care premiums. “The longer we sit around and bow to the altar of borrowing or federal aid, the less we actually try to solve the problems,” said Andrew Rein, the Citizens Budget Commission’s president. “All the risk is on the downside. The chance that it gets worse is high. Budget experts expect the economic situation to markedly worsen in the 2022 fiscal year, in part because of the city’s diminishing reserves. Based on the mayor’s last budget plan, the Independent Budget Office estimates that the city will face a $6 billion shortfall next year. The city has also taken hits from the loss of state aid and Mr. Cuomo’s successful efforts to shift state costs to the city, such as Metropolitan Transportation Authority capital funding.

			<data> The latest Supreme Court decision sets the stage for further attacks on abortion rights. It is separate from the newsroom. Chief Justice John Roberts arriving at the Capitol in January. rights on Monday, with Chief Justice John Roberts concurring with the liberals on the court to strike down a Louisiana anti-abortion law. That sentence might surprise a lot of people, given that the chief justice is a staunch conservative, and that the court now has a solid right-wing majority. President Trump achieved that majority by appointing two justices with the express purpose of pushing a hard-right agenda, as determined by legal groups like the Federalist Society. Obliterating abortion access in America is at the top of that priority list. What’s more, Chief Justice Roberts dissented in a case just four years ago that struck down what was an effectively identical Texas anti-abortion law. June Medical Services v. became: Would the chief justice’s disapproval of abortion outweigh his desire for the court to respect its own very recent precedent? It turns out that it didn’t. In a concurring opinion that provided the fifth vote for a majority, the chief justice wrote that the court’s doctrine requires it to “treat like cases alike. ” Because the Louisiana law — which requires doctors who perform abortions to get admitting privileges at a hospital near their clinic, supposedly in the interests of women’s health and safety — was more or less a carbon copy of the Texas law the court previously struck down, and because it burdened women in the same way, it “cannot stand,” he wrote. That’s good as far as it goes, which is not very far. It would be a mistake to interpret this decision as a sign that the chief justice has had a change of heart about protecting the bodily autonomy of American women. Even in his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts said that he still believes that the Texas case was “wrongly decided” and that he voted to strike down the Louisiana law solely out of respect for precedent. He appears to have decided that the circumstances of this case were not ideal for crippling reproductive rights — but he left the door open to doing so in the future. Monday’s decision, with the plurality opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, isn’t so much good news for reproductive freedom as it is a temporary reprieve from all the bad. Abortion access in many parts of the country is abysmal — five states have only one abortion clinic, for instance. If the Louisiana law had been upheld, clinics in that state (which has only three such facilities) and across the country could have closed, forcing many women to travel longer distances at prohibitive expense to receive reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood v. . A Federal District Court in Louisiana struck down the state’s law because it posed such an undue burden, just as the Texas law had. But the conservative federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed that decision, ruling that the lower court had gotten the facts wrong — that it was not clear that the new law would actually burden women’s ability to get an abortion. Monday’s decision reversed the Fifth Circuit ruling, holding that the district court had gotten it right the first time. The Louisiana law, Justice Breyer wrote, was “almost word-for-word identical” to Texas’ unconstitutional law and imposed identical if not greater burdens on women, and therefore was invalid. Chief Justice Roberts’s decision to concur with the four liberal justices may enrage cultural conservatives who thought that with the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, ending the right to an abortion was just a matter of time. But the chief justice rarely takes the direct route, preferring incremental rulings that slowly chip away at the court’s longstanding precedents. So no one should be fooled this time around: The current court is as hostile to reproductive freedom as it ever was. And Chief Justice Roberts left himself plenty of room to vote differently in any of the many cases now speeding toward the court, involving challenges to other state laws that make it difficult if not impossible for most women to obtain an abortion. Some of those challenges — like those to laws in Texas and Arkansas that ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure called dilation and evacuation — could give the chief justice an opening to make what he might consider a more reasonable argument for further undermining abortion rights. No doubt anti-abortion forces behind these cases will continue to push hard; they have a knack for rejiggering their strategy after each big case, and they’ve been especially aggressive in their efforts recently. , answering questions so ineptly that she gave the chief justice little to work with, even if he had been inclined to side with the court’s other conservatives. It’s concerning that this case made it to the high court at all, given its similarity to the Texas case. It’s even more concerning that the rights of millions of women hinged in part on someone having a bad day in court. But such is the state of reproductive rights in 2020: Members of the pro-choice side count their blessings over the narrowest of victories, while anti-choice crusaders continue to think big, strategic and long-term.

Abortion access in many parts of the country is abysmal — five states have only one abortion clinic, for instance. If the Louisiana law had been upheld, clinics in that state (which has only three such facilities) and across the country could have closed, forcing many women to travel longer distances at prohibitive expense to receive reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood v. . A Federal District Court in Louisiana struck down the state’s law because it posed such an undue burden, just as the Texas law had. But the conservative federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed that decision, ruling that the lower court had gotten the facts wrong — that it was not clear that the new law would actually burden women’s ability to get an abortion. Monday’s decision reversed the Fifth Circuit ruling, holding that the district court had gotten it right the first time. The Louisiana law, Justice Breyer wrote, was “almost word-for-word identical” to Texas’ unconstitutional law and imposed identical if not greater burdens on women, and therefore was invalid. Chief Justice Roberts’s decision to concur with the four liberal justices may enrage cultural conservatives who thought that with the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, ending the right to an abortion was just a matter of time. But the chief justice rarely takes the direct route, preferring incremental rulings that slowly chip away at the court’s longstanding precedents. So no one should be fooled this time around: The current court is as hostile to reproductive freedom as it ever was. And Chief Justice Roberts left himself plenty of room to vote differently in any of the many cases now speeding toward the court, involving challenges to other state laws that make it difficult if not impossible for most women to obtain an abortion. Some of those challenges — like those to laws in Texas and Arkansas that ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure called dilation and evacuation — could give the chief justice an opening to make what he might consider a more reasonable argument for further undermining abortion rights. No doubt anti-abortion forces behind these cases will continue to push hard; they have a knack for rejiggering their strategy after each big case, and they’ve been especially aggressive in their efforts recently. , answering questions so ineptly that she gave the chief justice little to work with, even if he had been inclined to side with the court’s other conservatives. It’s concerning that this case made it to the high court at all, given its similarity to the Texas case. It’s even more concerning that the rights of millions of women hinged in part on someone having a bad day in court. But such is the state of reproductive rights in 2020: Members of the pro-choice side count their blessings over the narrowest of victories, while anti-choice crusaders continue to think big, strategic and long-term.</data>

Not to worry, says the president.

			<data> is a Times Opinion series on emerging from this crisis with a fair, resilient society. The coronavirus pandemic is exposing a central flaw in America’s health care system. Interlandi is a member of the editorial board. In the early months of 2020, Americans were engaged in the perennial election-year debate over how best to reform the nation’s health care system. As usual, the electorate was torn and confused. of likely voters favored a new universal system that would cover everyone. But that support evaporated when it was made clear that any such overhaul would involve abolishing the private insurance market. Americans received their health benefits through an employer, and the vast majority of them liked that coverage just fine — maybe not enough to sing about it, but enough to be wary of a potential replacement. Then came the pandemic of the century. And the highest level of unemployment since the Great Recession. filed new unemployment claims between mid-March and late May. from the Commonwealth Fund is not encouraging: 41 percent of those who lost a job (or whose spouse lost a job) because of the pandemic relied on that job for health insurance; 20 percent of those people have not managed to secure alternative coverage. Nothing illuminates the problems with an employer-based health care system quite like massive unemployment in the middle of a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease outbreak. For one thing, uninsured people are less likely to seek medical care, making this coronavirus that much more difficult to contain. Also, people with chronic or immune-compromising medical conditions are particularly susceptible to this new contagion — which means the people most in need of employer-sponsored health benefits are the same ones who can least afford to return to work at the moment. “The pandemic has amplified all the vulnerabilities in our health care system,” says Drew Altman, president of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, including “the uninsured, racial disparities, the crisis of unmanaged chronic conditions and the general lack of national planning. As dire as the crisis is, though, it’s also an opportunity to look at health care reform with fresh eyes — and to maybe, finally, rebuild the nation’s health care system in a way that works for all Americans, not just the wealthy and the well employed. The first step will be acknowledging the problems of our current system. If American health care were its own country, it would be the fourth largest in the world by gross domestic product. per year on health care — more than Japan, Germany, France, China, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Brazil, Spain and Australia combined — and still loses more people to preventable and treatable medical conditions than any of those countries do. health care system in the modern world, and the most vulnerable Americans have been paying for that failure with their lives since long before the coronavirus came to town. In many ways, of course, that system is no system at all. It’s a patchwork in which access to care depends on a roster of factors, including age, employment status and state of residence. It’s a labyrinth in which consultants, billing clerks and administrators vastly outnumber medical professionals. And it’s a voracious beast that feeds American households with well-paying jobs, then devours them with insurmountable medical bills — often at their weakest moments. The story of how this nonsystem came to be begins during World War II, when a trifecta of policy choices permanently altered the health care landscape. First, President Franklin D. Roosevelt froze wages to prevent the nation’s massive shortage of able-bodied men from sending labor costs through the roof. Then, the National War Labor Board, a federal agency created to resolve labor disputes during wartime, ruled that health insurance would not count as wages; this allowed employers trying to compete for workers in a tight market to offer health insurance to prospective hires without violating the wage regulations. And finally, the Internal Revenue Service determined that such insurance benefits would not be taxed. The inequities of this arrangement were clear from the start. It excluded elderly and disabled Americans because they couldn’t work, and low-wage workers and racial minorities, because they couldn’t secure the kinds of jobs that offered health insurance. But employer-based insurance was popular — employers had better bargaining power than individuals, and it was easier to have them handle the logistics — and elected officials faced little pressure to create a more robust alternative. In the decades that followed, even as officials fortified public schools, transit systems and utilities, they left health care to the private markets. Eventually, Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act filled some of the gaps created by employer-based insurance, but no program ever filled all of them. By Robert B.

Some of that increase can be attributed to advances in technology that made care more expensive. But a great deal of the spike resulted from what economists refer to as “price insensitivity” and what the rest of us might call obliviousness. “If the insurer is paying, nobody looks at the bill,” says Zack Cooper, a health economist at the Yale School of Medicine. “So you can raise prices as much as you want, and you can create a much more luxurious system overall, to justify it.

Rather than scrutinize those price hikes, which were passed from hospitals to insurers to customers, employers simply accepted them. The more generous the insurance package and the nicer the hospitals and clinics, the bigger the tax break for the companies paying the tab. “For employers, it’s essentially the house’s money,” Mr. “But then, for anyone not on that raft of good coverage, it’s enormous costs or nothing.

Perhaps worst of all, employees of every ilk frequently find themselves trapped: changing jobs, foregoing employment or taking professional risks (like starting a business) all involve changes in health insurance and, in the worst case scenario, a loss of coverage. The end result is a medical underclass whose horizons are contracted by the sheer logistics of hanging on to health care. To change this system, Americans will have to change their thinking. There is a tendency among workers with good health insurance to see those benefits as something that’s purely earned, through work. But employer-based insurance is heavily subsidized by the federal government. Those subsidies are not much different than the ones granted to low-income Americans through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, but through the lens of American politics the latter are frequently derided as an outrageous form of welfare, while the former are accepted as par for the course. That thinking may already be evolving. , nearly 60 percent of Americans agree that health care is a human right and that the government should be responsible for ensuring that as many people as possible can access it when they need to. But to truly realize this ideal, the country will have to stop making employers the sole source of health care for so many people. America must create either a new health care system or offer significantly more options within the current one. There’s no shortage of ideas for how to accomplish this goal. A single-payer system in which one entity (usually the federal government) covers every citizen regardless of age or employment status, could work. So could a new “public option” that makes federally guaranteed health insurance available to many more people. Any such choice will involve trade-offs and will need to be accompanied by other aggressive reforms, including price controls and checks on the influence of special interests over legislation. Any of these reforms will be politically difficult.

			<data> Luttig is a former U. S. Court of Appeals judge. that ordered Judge Emmett Sullivan to dismiss the prosecution against Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, for lying to the F. How could anyone understand the decision given how politicized the matter has become? Not even the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit appears to have understood its own case. The case is important — involving the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary — and has had a few twists and turns. It started when the government, in a highly controversial move, asked Judge Sullivan for his approval — or his “leave” — to dismiss Mr. Flynn’s prosecution, a requirement under federal rules. Judge Sullivan scheduled a hearing to determine whether to give that approval. Flynn, in turn, asked the higher court, the Court of Appeals, to dismiss his prosecution now, before Judge Sullivan decides whether to dismiss it. In considering Mr. Flynn’s request, the appeals court had before it three simple questions: Does Mr. Flynn have a clear and indisputable right to have his case dismissed — before Judge Sullivan rules? Does he have any other remedy for the harm he may suffer if the case is not dismissed immediately? And last, is ending Mr. Flynn’s prosecution now, before Judge Sullivan rules, “appropriate under the circumstances”? As it turns out, the Court of Appeals panel decided none of these three questions. Take the first question. had a clear and indisputable right to immediate dismissal. prosecution dismissed immediately. “The circumstances of this case demonstrate,” Judge Neomi Rao wrote, that immediate dismissal “is appropriate to prevent the judicial usurpation of executive power. ” However, it was not the government that asked the appeals court to dismiss Mr. Flynn’s prosecution before Judge Sullivan ruled. It was Mr. The divided Court of Appeals also purported to, but did not, decide whether Mr. Flynn would suffer irreparable harm by having to wait for Judge Sullivan’s ruling — harm for which there is no other remedy, such as vindication on appeal. Judge Sullivan’s decision to hold a hearing “will result in specific harms to the exercise of the Executive Branch’s exclusive prosecutorial power that cannot be remedied on appeal,” Judge Rao wrote. Finally, the court turned to the third question of whether the immediate dismissal requested by Mr. Flynn “is appropriate under the circumstances. prosecution, which it had not. motion to dismiss the charges against Mr. prosecution against Mr. Flynn now (which it is not, by the way), then Mr. prosecution by the government now, too. But that is just not true, because the government’s rights and interests in immediate dismissal are vastly different from and greater than Mr. Flynn’s, which are lesser by far. And it is Mr. Flynn, not the government, who sought dismissal before Judge Sullivan can rule. Knowingly or not, the Court of Appeals simply appears to have bungled perhaps the most consequential political constitutional case in recent memory. Every day, courts err and often even grievously. That said, the question now is whether the entire Court of Appeals will or should rehear this significant constitutional case. There are sound reasons for rehearing the case and for not. The choice for the full court is an exceedingly difficult one. Were the court to decide to rehear this case, its decision would unavoidably be perceived by many as the court’s positioning itself to rule for the losing side in last week’s case, evening the political score in this pitched partisan battle. This would only further politicize the already politicized case and the federal judiciary along with it. Prolonging what would then be a three-ring judicial circus would exact an almost unconscionable price from the integrity of the judicial process. Were the full court to decide not to rehear the case, the errant edict of the three-judge panel would quickly be corrected in succeeding cases. Because the panel actually did not decide the important questions that it should have decided, its opinion will never be regarded as precedent. On the other hand, while the opinion of the three-judge panel is grievously wrong, and as premature and ill reasoned as its decision was, the court reached the result that almost certainly will be required by law after any hearing that the full court could constitutionally authorize Judge Sullivan to conduct. The government’s facially and unrebutted reasons for wanting to dismiss the prosecution — namely that the government itself wrongly investigated and prosecuted Mr. Flynn in the first place and then withheld exculpatory evidence from him in the second place — are constitutionally compelling. Accordingly, the law will almost certainly countenance neither Judge Sullivan’s proposed interrogation of the government as to the political ulterior motives and purposes that he suspects — but only suspects — nor at the end of the day a decision to deny his leave for the government to dismiss its prosecution of Flynn. This is high legal drama in the federal court and high political drama around the country. And the partisans have all but succeeded in expropriating this case of law into service for their respective impassioned political agendas. Fortunately for our country, this case will not be decided by partisanship. It will not be decided by the rule of politics. It will be decided by the rule of law. J.

How could anyone understand the decision given how politicized the matter has become? Not even the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit appears to have understood its own case. The case is important — involving the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary — and has had a few twists and turns. It started when the government, in a highly controversial move, asked Judge Sullivan for his approval — or his “leave” — to dismiss Mr. Flynn’s prosecution, a requirement under federal rules.

The coronavirus is still raging, particularly in states like Texas, Arizona and Florida. We already know what it takes to beat it. We just need to do it. As infection rates rapidly rise in many red states, Senate Republicans can and should legislate to protect their constituents and their country. It’s good politics to save lives while saving the economy.

By detecting and containing new outbreaks before they spread, these market economies plan to stay open, resilient and competitive, while America’s economy loses ground amid new waves of infection. Many Republicans think that market incentives and private-sector spending will be enough to drive innovation in diagnostics and therapeutics and to spur manufacturers to finally churn out enough tests. But this is wrong. The private sector alone can’t contain Covid-19. Stopping disease spread is a classic collective-action problem. Relying on businesses and institutions like churches and possibly schools to stop the spread of an infectious disease is akin to relying on private security to stop terrorism. The well-to-do have the means to protect themselves with defensive testing, but the rest of us will be left on our own, potentially leaving the disease free to spread through vulnerable communities. Private institutions then need to spend even more — digging their moats deeper, building their walls higher — to stave off the virus. It’s the worst possible outcome: The disease continues to rampage, costs for defensive testing pile up, social inequities deepen and our sputtering economy never takes off because no one really feels safe. Private testing, like private security, is inefficient because private institutions lack the intelligence and authority to strategically target and subdue threats beyond their walls. The proven strategy for virus suppression relies on contact tracing through communities. The bulk of testing is initially aimed at symptomatic individuals in health care settings and likely hot spots, with additional testing in “critical contexts” like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants susceptible to disease spread. positive case are traced until the chain of transmission yields zero positives. In a successful suppression surge, contact tracing turns up the vast majority of positive cases. S. strategy should start by breaking states down into colored zones, representing levels of outbreak: green is the safest, followed by yellow, orange and red. yellow and orange zones before higher-incidence red zones, because lower-incidence zones require less testing and tracing to stop community spread and can stay open with safety precautions during a surge. Within a state, just a few months of surging testing and tracing can result in green zones — which means less than one new daily case for every 100,000 people. Once a zone falls into the green, people no longer have to fear outbreaks at school, church or work. To stay green, states maintain a minimum level of testing and tracing to identify and quash new infections before they spread. But can’t we just muddle through until we get a breakthrough vaccine next summer? clinical trials succeeds in identifying an effective drug or vaccine without unacceptable side effects. There is no vaccine for any coronavirus. It’s possible a Covid-19 vaccine may resemble a seasonal flu vaccine, which confers immunity to only a few strains, rather than a one-time polio vaccine. Furthermore, widespread fears about vaccines may stall progress toward herd immunity. Suppressing the virus requires Congress to adequately fund states to the tune of $43. 5 billion to do the work of testing, tracing and supported isolation. Contact tracing is a fundamentally local activity; community trust and connection are no less important than a contact tracer’s professional training. State public health departments have already begun activating civil society and building this local infrastructure of trust.

Because there is no reason to think that Chief Justice Roberts believes the Constitution protects a right to choose. He suggested in his opinion on Monday that the court’s most recent strengthening of the standard that states may not impose an “undue burden” on a women’s ability to obtain an abortion was a mistake. To him, it doesn’t matter if abortion restrictions serve no useful purpose, because nothing in the court’s abortion jurisprudence “suggested that a weighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was a job for the courts. Moreover, he wrote, the court’s 2016 decision to strike down the Texas law was “wrongly decided,” But respect for precedent matters to the chief justice, and if the anti-abortion movement wants him to help unravel abortion rights, as his four conservative colleagues seem game to do, it will have to give him a way to do it while upholding the court’s institutional legitimacy. This clearly wasn’t the case for that. One might have thought otherwise.

			<data> The state wanted to be among the first to reopen. It’s now dealing with the consequences. Greg Abbott of Texas speaking about the state’s response to the coronavirus this month in Austin, Tex. HOUSTON — For one brief, delusional moment in early April, I felt a smidgen of support for my governor, Greg Abbott. Sure, part of me thought his plan to reopen the state after just a few weeks of lockdown was cuckoo. Medical experts warned of a surge in coronavirus cases if Texas did just that. But Texas is a big state, I told myself, and why should people out in Mentone or Daisetta have to close up shop when the hot spots were many miles down the highway? And yes, I knew the governor’s fevered, ferocious fealty to President Trump made his push suspect. But really, what kind of person would put politics over the safety of his constituents? It wasn’t as if Mr. of a statewide stay at home order on March 31, following in the footsteps of brave(r) local officials. Uncharacteristically for a Republican state official perpetually at war with the Democratic cities, he allowed the likes of my Houston mayor, Sylvester Turner, and the Harris County judge, Lina Hidalgo, to use their best judgment when it came to protecting public health — that is, until they tried to enforce mask-wearing, which, to Mr. Abbott’s way of thinking, was an infringement of our treasured individual rights. of early May, when a judge sentenced a Dallas area beauty salon owner named Shelley Luther to jail for contempt of court after she reopened in defiance of Mr. Abbott’s shutdown, which included jail terms for violators. Luther became a folk hero thanks partly to opportunistic patriots like Sarah Palin and Ted Cruz. Abbott contradicted his own order, demanding Ms. that “throwing Texans in jail who have had their businesses shut down through no fault of their own is nonsensical, and I will not allow it to happen. But while New York and Washington were in crisis, the number of cases and deaths here remained remarkably low. Maybe Texas was being spared because of a lack of density in our cities or because people drove alone in their cars instead of cramming into subways. Maybe our already rising temperatures were killing off the virus. Maybe, in contrast to the yahoo stereotype, most Texans were wearing masks, socially distancing and washing their hands and so had actually headed the virus off at the pass, or dodged the bullet, or whatever people think we like to say down here. And maybe for those reasons, Mr. Abbott became infatuated with the idea that Texas would be among the first states to reopen. As he said, Texans needed to get back to work. That was indisputable. The food bank near my house was already overwhelmed with the unemployed and hungry. Peter Hotez, Houston’s internationally known virus expert, warned of the dangers of opening early, but what did he know? The guy wears a bow tie. With cases in Texas on the rise, a rural hospital braces for an outbreak while trying to stave off financial ruin. One of the difficulties in a small rural hospital is we don’t have a lot of resources. We have two ventilators and four anesthesia machines. If we had six or more critically ill Covid patients, we would be overwhelmed. We don’t have the equipment to be able to support that many severely sick patients. That’s why it’s so scary for rural hospitals. Our county has about 15,000 people. But we have another 33,000 people that go through here everyday on the Interstate. And I’m going to have to go get one of them to bring me another test. And we’ll go ahead and do it while you’re here. We deliver the tests to Snyder, which is 40 miles away. They drive them to Lubbock, which is another 100 miles. Or they could be flown to a lab in Austin. Sometimes, we have test results in seven days. I just dropped two specimens off. I’ve got to go print labels for one. We’ve had four positive patients in our county. The most troubling piece to me is to know that it’s probably still coming. Nearly two-thirds of rural counties are reporting outbreaks of Covid-19. In little bitty hospitals that a hot spot will pop up. In one week, they have no patients. In the next week, they have 300 positives. Rural hospitals are at a disadvantage. We are all barely hanging on by a thread. Rural hospitals are facing a different kind of crisis, which is how to financially survive during the pandemic, as they shut down elective surgeries out of an abundance of caution. Another month or two of that, that would be unsustainable. We have another rural hospital closing this week. How far do we let the economy suffer for protection? And how far do we let protection suffer for the economy? So today, I’m issuing an executive order that outlines how we go about opening the Texas economy. And I know that’s a difficult decision that we individually are having to make— People were ready to get out and grab a drink. and our hospitals’ are having to make, and that our country’s having to make. Twenty states reporting increases in new cases. Tonight, Texas reporting its largest single day in cases ever. Though the virus hadn’t yet reached us, it was already our enemy. It is concerning that, as we start opening back up, that people just quit self-distancing. And then it does get in our nursing home. How are you? Get your phone so we can talk. You’re doing OK? I guess I’m doing OK. I love you. I love you. I’ll be there every day at her window until I can get my hands on her. I have a concern that she would die alone. I know that many people in the country have died alone. Back in March, we decided to forgo all elective procedures before we were required to do so, in order to save lives. Typically at 10 o’clock on a Monday, usually this E. R. would be full. It’s sort of a curse and a blessing. A large portion of our income is generated from surgery procedures. Restricting those cost us over $2 million. Everyone took a 10 percent pay cut. It’s very personal. Because these people are friends and colleagues. And you hate to ask them to sacrifice. That’s a very tough decision to make. For days, we waited for a significant number of Covid patients. But at the same time, we were moving very quickly towards financial disaster. I could never live with myself if I was the one that got my kids sick. So the kids, they went to stay with their grandparents. If this hospital couldn’t survive, where would we go? What would we do? Our family’s rooted here. We don’t want to go anywhere. The presence of a pandemic is just one more financial burden on struggling rural hospitals. High numbers of uninsured patients have forced 128 hospitals to close in the last decade, in Texas more than any other state. It’s staggering to think that there are 11 million people who, in their county, cannot go to a hospital. There are a handful of counties across Texas that don’t have a doctor in the county. To drive 150 miles or more to get to a hospital, that’s absolutely the difference between life and death. When Governor Abbott reopened Texas, there was kind of a mixed sense of relief and fear. My anxiety went through the roof. We reopened our hospital for elective surgeries on May the 11th. It was an absolute necessity to get the funds running again. There are certain pieces that I couldn’t have fixed without help. We had to have federal intervention. The Trump administration promised to rush $10 billion for rural health care providers. That’s money that’s going to support the hospitals that gave up elective procedures, which is how they make so much of their money. We knew then that we would have the money be able to keep the doors open. When the state had been opened up for three weeks, my husband and I wanted to bring the kids back home. I actually got the best birthday present and went and got them for my 35th birthday. And they had a carrot cake made for me — or a bunny cake, as they call it. I knew you’d be here any minute! I don’t know what the future will bring. I don’t know if we’ll ever hit that storm of patients to come in. And if so, we might end up taking the kids back to their grandparents. We are a very vital part of these small communities. And most of us get paid less than what it costs us to provide care. We need to be paid fairly for what we do. I think you’re going to see rural medicine continue to kind of just dwindle. Because I think that everybody should have care that’s accessible to them. This is Dr. Liedtke with an update from Sweetwater. Covid has finally arrived. We have over 10 active cases in the county, one hospitalized with critical illness, requiring respiratory support. With cases in Texas on the rise, a rural hospital braces for an outbreak while trying to stave off financial ruin. For a short time, then, I wondered if Mr. Abbott had been right. His three-step reopening plan sensible enough, with Phase 1 allowing restaurants, retail stores, movie theaters and beauty salons to operate at 25 percent capacity. It was life-affirming to see all those “we are open! ” banners flapping in the breeze — to go out to a new restaurant and see all the folks inappropriately shaking hands and hugging one another. I even got a pedicure, protected from my technician with a plexiglass shield etched with the words “Customer Safety First. On Memorial Day, the Galveston beaches were packed like Carnival in Rio. And out in rural Texas, folks who had no choice were working away in meat-processing plants. Businesses like Target and Wal-Mart welcomed shoppers without masks as if it were Black Friday. As we now know, that was then. That date coincided with the arrival of Mr. Abbott’s Phase 3, which allowed many businesses to reopen at 75 percent capacity on June 12. Shortly after that, the numbers exploded. The governor knew better than to blame better testing for the increase, because we don’t have enough testing. But, no worries, the governor added; Texas still has plenty of hospital beds. And today, we have more than 130,000 cases, up from over 60,000 at the end of May. And so, here we are, with a jittery populace and the Texas Medical Center’s coronavirus website competing with TikTok. U.s in Houston are at 97 percent capacity, with “unsustainable surge capacity” predicted for hospital beds in late July. , “Houston would become the worst-affected city in the U. S.” He added that it would “maybe rival what we’re seeing now in Brazil. Still, taking his cues from the president, Mr. Abbott refused to issue a statewide mask-wearing order. a plan to require masks all along — he just put the onus on business and store owners to require mask wearing instead of a bullying state government. Abbott never stressed this brilliant solution in public was beside the point. It wasn’t his fault that no local officials caught on until this week. “Earlier today the county judge in Bexar County finally figured that out,” Mr. Abbott said after the judge mandated that businesses require their workers and customers to generally wear masks in the county, which includes San Antonio, last week. “They finally read what we had written. ” This is government as a game of Clue: Governor Abbott in the Statehouse with the masked mask order. Now with the numbers climbing, Mr. outdoor events to 100 people (down from 500), closing bars and suspending elective surgeries in some counties to save potentially needed bed space. for 14 days upon arrival. “We want to make sure that everyone reinforces the best safe practices of wearing a mask, hand sanitization, maintaining safe distance, but importantly, because the spread is so rampant right now, there’s never a reason for you to have to leave your home,” Mr. in a recent interview. “Unless you do need to go out, the safest place for you is at your home. In other words, we are all in this together. But we are also completely and totally on our own. The state wanted to be among the first to reopen. It’s now dealing with the consequences. Greg Abbott of Texas speaking about the state’s response to the coronavirus this month in Austin, Tex. HOUSTON — For one brief, delusional moment in early April, I felt a smidgen of support for my governor, Greg Abbott. Sure, part of me thought his plan to reopen the state after just a few weeks of lockdown was cuckoo. Medical experts warned of a surge in coronavirus cases if Texas did just that. But Texas is a big state, I told myself, and why should people out in Mentone or Daisetta have to close up shop when the hot spots were many miles down the highway? And yes, I knew the governor’s fevered, ferocious fealty to President Trump made his push suspect. But really, what kind of person would put politics over the safety of his constituents? It wasn’t as if Mr. of a statewide stay at home order on March 31, following in the footsteps of brave(r) local officials. Uncharacteristically for a Republican state official perpetually at war with the Democratic cities, he allowed the likes of my Houston mayor, Sylvester Turner, and the Harris County judge, Lina Hidalgo, to use their best judgment when it came to protecting public health — that is, until they tried to enforce mask-wearing, which, to Mr. Abbott’s way of thinking, was an infringement of our treasured individual rights. of early May, when a judge sentenced a Dallas area beauty salon owner named Shelley Luther to jail for contempt of court after she reopened in defiance of Mr. Abbott’s shutdown, which included jail terms for violators. Luther became a folk hero thanks partly to opportunistic patriots like Sarah Palin and Ted Cruz. Abbott contradicted his own order, demanding Ms. that “throwing Texans in jail who have had their businesses shut down through no fault of their own is nonsensical, and I will not allow it to happen. But while New York and Washington were in crisis, the number of cases and deaths here remained remarkably low. Maybe Texas was being spared because of a lack of density in our cities or because people drove alone in their cars instead of cramming into subways. Maybe our already rising temperatures were killing off the virus. Maybe, in contrast to the yahoo stereotype, most Texans were wearing masks, socially distancing and washing their hands and so had actually headed the virus off at the pass, or dodged the bullet, or whatever people think we like to say down here. And maybe for those reasons, Mr. Abbott became infatuated with the idea that Texas would be among the first states to reopen. As he said, Texans needed to get back to work. That was indisputable. The food bank near my house was already overwhelmed with the unemployed and hungry. Peter Hotez, Houston’s internationally known virus expert, warned of the dangers of opening early, but what did he know? The guy wears a bow tie.

			<data> A conversation with the graphic designer, who, until his death at 91, was still thinking about how his craft could help his beleaguered city. At the time of his death, Milton Glaser was working on a graphical treatment of the word “Together,” to evoke the idea that during the separation of the pandemic, “we have something in common. Five weeks ago, I received a call from Milton Glaser. We’d never met, but he was kindly answering an email I’d sent his studio a few hours prior. At best, I expected a response from his assistant. Instead, I got a FaceTime Audio call from the 90-year-old graphic designer. The result was a conversation that ranged from the confounding nature of his success to the motivation for his latest project. , his 91st birthday. Only a few weeks before our conversation, New York had hit its Covid-19 apex. The infection and death rates were slowing, but the city’s future remained in question. My prompt to Mr. ” logo, scratched out in the back of a taxicab — help galvanize an ailing city? Glaser was already grappling with some version of the same question. In between dialysis, he had been working on a project he hoped to distribute to public school students across the city, and ultimately the country. It was a graphical treatment of the word “Together. “There was no business plan,” said Ignacio Serrano, Mr. Glaser’s graphic designer and studio manager. “It was about connecting people through art. He would use the example of, ‘If you like Mozart and I like Mozart, we already have something in common. We have a bridge. Glaser’s health was already in decline when the Black Lives Matter protests spread throughout the city, and then the world. “If he had more time,” said Mr. Serrano, “I’m sure he would have come to the office with some ideas. Here are excerpts from my conversation with Mr. They have been edited and condensed for clarity. Glaser in his studio in 2012. “New York is a mind-set,” he said in an interview five weeks ago, “and we’re all arrogantly proud of what that represents. First, how have you been managing throughout the pandemic? Well, I’m in dialysis three days a week. I’m at a facility that basically takes care of all your needs and excludes the world. It’s as though you’re suspended in space. But I realize that the whole world is now suspended in space, so it’s not so unusual. At the same time, I’m trying to acquire a new studio next door to a new apartment we bought. So that is the height of optimism, to buy a new apartment at the age of 90. Is it hard to do culturally relevant work, the type you’re focusing on, while “being excluded from the world”? You still have the same issues as any design, which is effectiveness. And you still have to invent stuff out of your own psyche, and assume that people will be equally moved or challenged by the idea. I’m actually developing something I haven’t shown to anyone, which is simply a treatment of the word “Together. What gave you the idea for “Together”? When you watch television now it’s so depressing. This sense of inertia, of not being able to determine your own future, it’s very eroding. All we can do is have this sense that we are not alone. “We’re all in this together” has been reiterated a thousand times, but you can create the symbolic equivalent of that phrase by just using the word “together,” and then making those letters [look] as though they are all different, but all related. So if you want to use the word “together” it evokes the entire phrase and the idea that we have something in common. What’s absent from “Together” is an overt reference to New York, the city that’s been the focus of much of your previous work. I did that in order for it to be universal in the same way that “I ♥ NY” was. I want this identity to be adapted by others who are not New Yorkers. This is of course a world problem, not a New York problem. You developed the iconic “I ♥ NY” logo in 1977, and revisited it after the attacks of Sept. 11 with “I ♥ NY More Than Ever. ” Could “Together” have a similar impact? Well, I’ve done a lot of work in my life, but nothing was as durable as “I ♥ NY. ” For some reason, and it’s a great mystery, that idea went all around the world. It hasn’t disappeared into the pit of advertising material or sloganism, it’s still all around. Particularly in advertising, we’re in a cycle of a month per idea, and it’s gone, and then there’s something else to replace it. After all these years, I don’t understand what it is that makes an idea compelling enough to move a person to a different perception. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. You’re skeptical that your current project can have an impact, but you’re still doing it? There must be some sense that it can break through. I have no idea. Actually, I’m surprised by how these pieces of art can affect people, and can affect their mood or attitude. Design starts with a desire to change an existing condition, but as I said, the shift is something you hope for, and most of the time don’t get it. The “I ♥ NY” logo started with a city commissioner coming together with an advertising agency. Would you like to see Mayor de Blasio or Governor Cuomo do more to engage the artistic community in this moment? Well, I think they don’t understand the power of these ideas. And what they do is they hire perfectly competent people and agencies that specialize in professional work. And to some degree, this is not professional. It’s quite the opposite. Professional work guarantees results, and this has no guarantee, but we hope it opens the heart. And so it’s very hard to quantify and it’s certainly very hard for a government to select people that it’s comfortable with, who are also extraordinary. You need people who go beyond what is objective and what is logical. I suppose you have to call them artists. You’re a lifelong New Yorker. Is there something inherent in this city that will enable it to recover from the devastation of the pandemic? New York is full of diversity and complexity, and it’s very hard to analyze because of that. New York is a mind-set, and we’re all arrogantly proud of what that represents. The word they’ve used is toughness, but it’s also a combination of cynicism and generosity. It’s unprecedented anywhere in the world. So it really cannot be characterized as just another city, somewhere. It’s a kind of self-contained universe, and by virtue of that, it makes decisions that other places don’t. What advice would you give younger creatives, especially those who have been particularly active and engaged during this time? There’s an odd combination of intuition and intelligence that has to be mustered to do this work. The part that is logical is only half the job. The other half is truly intuitive and comes out of some part of the brain that you can’t control. It’s the reconciliation of those two aspects that make things happen. But since the brain is an instrument that holds everything in the universe, it’s there somewhere. Do you have any predictions as to how we come out of this moment? I have no faith in my own prediction. I don’t think there’s any way of telling what’s going to happen. I know this [pandemic] is a cosmic change and that nothing will ever be the same again. But I do know that if there’s a collective consciousness, if we realize we are all related and we need one another, that would be the best thing that could happen.

My prompt to Mr. ” logo, scratched out in the back of a taxicab — help galvanize an ailing city? Glaser was already grappling with some version of the same question. In between dialysis, he had been working on a project he hoped to distribute to public school students across the city, and ultimately the country. It was a graphical treatment of the word “Together. “There was no business plan,” said Ignacio Serrano, Mr. Glaser’s graphic designer and studio manager. “It was about connecting people through art. He would use the example of, ‘If you like Mozart and I like Mozart, we already have something in common. We have a bridge. Glaser’s health was already in decline when the Black Lives Matter protests spread throughout the city, and then the world. “If he had more time,” said Mr. Serrano, “I’m sure he would have come to the office with some ideas. Here are excerpts from my conversation with Mr. They have been edited and condensed for clarity. Glaser in his studio in 2012. “New York is a mind-set,” he said in an interview five weeks ago, “and we’re all arrogantly proud of what that represents. First, how have you been managing throughout the pandemic? Well, I’m in dialysis three days a week. I’m at a facility that basically takes care of all your needs and excludes the world. It’s as though you’re suspended in space. But I realize that the whole world is now suspended in space, so it’s not so unusual. At the same time, I’m trying to acquire a new studio next door to a new apartment we bought. So that is the height of optimism, to buy a new apartment at the age of 90. Is it hard to do culturally relevant work, the type you’re focusing on, while “being excluded from the world”? You still have the same issues as any design, which is effectiveness. And you still have to invent stuff out of your own psyche, and assume that people will be equally moved or challenged by the idea. I’m actually developing something I haven’t shown to anyone, which is simply a treatment of the word “Together. What gave you the idea for “Together”? When you watch television now it’s so depressing. This sense of inertia, of not being able to determine your own future, it’s very eroding. All we can do is have this sense that we are not alone. “We’re all in this together” has been reiterated a thousand times, but you can create the symbolic equivalent of that phrase by just using the word “together,” and then making those letters [look] as though they are all different, but all related. So if you want to use the word “together” it evokes the entire phrase and the idea that we have something in common. What’s absent from “Together” is an overt reference to New York, the city that’s been the focus of much of your previous work. I did that in order for it to be universal in the same way that “I ♥ NY” was. I want this identity to be adapted by others who are not New Yorkers. This is of course a world problem, not a New York problem. You developed the iconic “I ♥ NY” logo in 1977, and revisited it after the attacks of Sept. 11 with “I ♥ NY More Than Ever. ” Could “Together” have a similar impact? Well, I’ve done a lot of work in my life, but nothing was as durable as “I ♥ NY. ” For some reason, and it’s a great mystery, that idea went all around the world. It hasn’t disappeared into the pit of advertising material or sloganism, it’s still all around. Particularly in advertising, we’re in a cycle of a month per idea, and it’s gone, and then there’s something else to replace it. After all these years, I don’t understand what it is that makes an idea compelling enough to move a person to a different perception. What’s the best material for a mask? have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles. Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask? points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. ” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work? according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. What is pandemic paid leave? gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen? So far, the evidence seems to show it does. published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. but she later walked back that statement. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. How does blood type influence coronavirus? , the illness caused by the coronavirus. was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U. The unemployment rate fell to 13. 3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14. 7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2. 5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them. What should I do if I feel sick? and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. You’re skeptical that your current project can have an impact, but you’re still doing it? There must be some sense that it can break through. I have no idea. Actually, I’m surprised by how these pieces of art can affect people, and can affect their mood or attitude. Design starts with a desire to change an existing condition, but as I said, the shift is something you hope for, and most of the time don’t get it. The “I ♥ NY” logo started with a city commissioner coming together with an advertising agency. Would you like to see Mayor de Blasio or Governor Cuomo do more to engage the artistic community in this moment? Well, I think they don’t understand the power of these ideas. And what they do is they hire perfectly competent people and agencies that specialize in professional work. And to some degree, this is not professional. It’s quite the opposite. Professional work guarantees results, and this has no guarantee, but we hope it opens the heart. And so it’s very hard to quantify and it’s certainly very hard for a government to select people that it’s comfortable with, who are also extraordinary. You need people who go beyond what is objective and what is logical. I suppose you have to call them artists. You’re a lifelong New Yorker. Is there something inherent in this city that will enable it to recover from the devastation of the pandemic? New York is full of diversity and complexity, and it’s very hard to analyze because of that. New York is a mind-set, and we’re all arrogantly proud of what that represents. The word they’ve used is toughness, but it’s also a combination of cynicism and generosity. It’s unprecedented anywhere in the world. So it really cannot be characterized as just another city, somewhere. It’s a kind of self-contained universe, and by virtue of that, it makes decisions that other places don’t. What advice would you give younger creatives, especially those who have been particularly active and engaged during this time? There’s an odd combination of intuition and intelligence that has to be mustered to do this work. The part that is logical is only half the job. The other half is truly intuitive and comes out of some part of the brain that you can’t control. It’s the reconciliation of those two aspects that make things happen. But since the brain is an instrument that holds everything in the universe, it’s there somewhere. Do you have any predictions as to how we come out of this moment? I have no faith in my own prediction. I don’t think there’s any way of telling what’s going to happen. I know this [pandemic] is a cosmic change and that nothing will ever be the same again. But I do know that if there’s a collective consciousness, if we realize we are all related and we need one another, that would be the best thing that could happen.

Efforts by Trump and his allies to suppress the vote are only part of the problem. : Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to American Democracy.

And how can we get there? , you are less likely to vote. likely to vote than young people, in some elections at twice their rate. than the less educated. for nonconformity with technical rules.

In a democratic system, we expect our elected officials to be responsive to the views and interests of the voters. We need equality in voting rights and turnout to assure responsive representation and social policy that reflects everyone’s needs, not just those most likely to turn out with their votes and dollars. Let’s start with the causes of the problem. with how we protect voting rights in the United States, and why the skew in voter turnout remains persistent. First, the United States election system features deep fragmentation of governmental authority over elections. Not only does the United States use a highly decentralized and localized election system that gives many powers over national elections to state and local bodies, but also, even within the approximately 10,500 bodies expected to run the 2020 election, there is sometimes disagreement over who has decision making authority over voting rights decisions. at one another as to who was to blame for long lines, inoperable new voting machines rolled out for the first time in a presidential election year and closed polling places. Second, protection of voting rights in the United States is marked by polarized and judicialized decision making. Some Republican decision makers controlling some aspects of American election machinery have pushed for laws and policies that make it harder for students, the poor and minority voters to register and vote, leading to a pushback by Democrats and voting rights groups to loosen those restrictions. advisers are comfortable using themselves. , a refusal to modify laws to assure continued access to the ballot. that his own rural and poorer supporters will either not vote or not be able to vote safely. Given the highly litigious nature of American society and American election law in particular, these political fights often wind up in court, and sometimes break along party lines in the courts as well. Protecting voting rights in 2020 America requires a state-by-state slog and often litigation in an uncertain legal environment. These battles have been especially intense since the Supreme Court in its 2013 decision in Shelby County v. a key protection for minority voters in the Voting rights Act. Finally, and related to this last point, constitutional protections for voting rights remain weak. S. Constitution contains no affirmative right to vote. It speaks of voting rights mostly in the negative: thanks to a number of constitutional amendments, it is now illegal to bar someone from voting on the basis of race, gender, age of at least 18, or through the use of a poll tax. The Constitution does guarantee equal protection of the laws in the 14th Amendment, and equal protection lawsuits have become the primary method by which those seeking to protect voting rights get federal court relief. Courts sometimes protect voting rights and sometimes they don’t, through application of an ad hoc and uncertain balancing test. age-discrimination and equal-protection arguments that it is unconstitutional for Texas to allow voters over the age of 65 to vote by mail without an excuse, while barring from the vote-by-mail option others who lack immunity from the coronavirus and fear going to a polling place to vote. for emergency relief from the Supreme Court. A decentralized, federalist approach to voting rights has led to a self-perpetuating system of voting inequality, where in some places you may be disenfranchised even if you do everything right. to vote by mail back in April, but had problems with their June primary ballots and had to wait in long lines at polling places to vote instead. In the short term, we need to take certain steps to assure that millions of voters already at risk of not voting are not disenfranchised through suppression, incompetence, and lack of resources in November. All states need to expand opportunities for online voter registration in time for November. People cannot go door-to-door during a pandemic as they usually would, signing up voters in the summer before a high-stakes election. California at least has same-day voter registration, but Texas does not. By Robert B. Are You Willing to Give Up Your Privilege? Congress needs to adequately fund additional expenses related to running an election during the pandemic. Absentee ballot requests will soar, whether states have the resources to process them or not, and fewer resources means more mistakes and a greater risk of disenfranchisement. It is also more expensive to run polling places with good hygiene and social distancing. or more to get our system ready. Even this won’t be enough. Lawsuits are going to be necessary to ensure that the kinds of debacles we have seen in Georgia and Wisconsin are not repeated in November. States need to form independent bipartisan task forces to conduct full and independent investigations into why areas with more poor voters and voters of color saw significant problems voting in person during the primaries. Beyond triage for 2020, longer term change requires bolder thinking. We need a new social movement, that may take a generation or more, pushing a constitutional amendment protecting the right to vote. It would guarantee all adult citizens the right to vote in federal elections, establish a nonpartisan administrative body to run federal elections that would automatically register all eligible voters to vote, and impose basic standards of voting access and competency for state and local elections. Talking of a constitutional amendment in the current polarized atmosphere may sound like a pipe dream when Congress cannot pass even basic voting rights protections, like restoring the part of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court destroyed. But the current situation is untenable. We need a 28th Amendment for voter equality around which people can organize and agitate. for passage of the 19th Amendment, which bars gender discrimination in voting. It took more than a generation for that amendment to pass, and along the way activists for equal women’s suffrage got state legislatures to bolster voting rights and the public to change its attitudes about voting. It has been 100 years since passage of the 19th Amendment and 150 since the passage of the 15th Amendment barring racial discrimination in voting. Despite those accomplishments, every national election features endless angst and litigation over assuring people the right to vote, which puts special burdens on those who already face the greatest barriers.

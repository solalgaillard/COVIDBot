Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office. CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and human remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71. 55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions: human remains are properly embalmed and placed in a leak-proof container; OR human remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. a permit CDCued by the CDC Director must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment. Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting? with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces.</data>

Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been present? The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical. After cleaning and disinfection, the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming: Consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is less that needs to be vacuumed. Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility. What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19? Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface.</data>

			<data>Is cleaning alone effective against The virus that causes COVID-19? Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten The virus that causes COVID-19 on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Who should clean and disinfect community spaces? Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used. How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work? Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i. e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the closed off area has been , the closed off area can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed. How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light? The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List N against The virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.</data>

			<data>Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19? Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e. g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e. g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19? CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that CDC are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19? CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective on these surfaces. Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. canine and feline coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.</data>

For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19? No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended. Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19? We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering. What animals can get COVID-19? We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for this virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with this virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.</data>

Should I worry about my pet cat? We are still learning about this virus and how my pet cat spreads, but my pet cat appears my pet cat can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets. Can I walk my dog during the COVID-19 pandemic? Walking my dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others.

			<data>Can I take my dog to a dog park? Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread COVID-19 to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather. Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park. Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting, or diarrhea. If your dog has for the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian about when it is appropriate for your pet to go back to normal activities. Try to limit your dog’s interaction with other people outside of your household while at the dog park.

For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new, concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, your veterinarian might consult with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed. Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19. Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19. Do not let pets in your facility interact with sick people.

			<data>What about imported animals or animal products? CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources. Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak? CDC’s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies. What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)? Imported animals will need to meet requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic bringing an animal into the clinic and let them know that an animal was recently imported from another country. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus in the United States. If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus in the United States, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19.</data>

			<data>Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States: Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young. Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat. Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead. Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread COVID-19 back to people? Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by COVID-19. Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic? Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations: Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead. Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.</data>

How can I safely run my equestrian facility? You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at my equestrian facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting my equestrian facility. Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter my equestrian facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Consider conducting daily health checks (e. g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting my equestrian facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100. 4 C) or above or other should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.

Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in my equestrian facility . Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for and avoid large numbers of people within my equestrian facility, including in employee-only areas. Visitors and employees should wear to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a cloth face covering does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing. Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within my equestrian facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants. on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding. If traveling to a new facility, from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders. Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities. People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a cloth face covering to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water. If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at my equestrian facility, be aware that a small number of have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.

			<data>Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, and prepare for it if it occurs, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available. What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19? Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing Covering mouth and nose with a Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily Promoting behaviors that prevent spread Preparing for when someone gets sick Closing businesses and schools and limiting other services Who is involved in community mitigation actions? Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness , and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. Putting mitigation into practice is based on Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. *CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of your healthcare provider and local health department . Local decisions depend on local circumstances. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water? the virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19.

			<data>COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool)? the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus that causes COVID-19 could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, Scientists think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through pools, hot tubs, spas, and water playgrounds? There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19. However, chlorinated water alone should not be used as a surface disinfectant. *CDC recommends use of to disinfect surfaces.

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through sewerage systems? the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19? Recently, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater.</data>

			<data>While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment ( ) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.

(Office of the Inspector General) Fever may be subjective or confirmed Close contact is defined as— a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e. g., being coughed on) If such contact occurs while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e. g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection), criteria for PUI consideration are met” Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Persons Under Investigation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e. g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e. g., coughing likely increases exposure risk as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in health care settings. FAQs for Law Enforcement Agencies and Personnel What does *CDC recommend for law enforcement personnel who have been in close contact (less than 6 feet) with a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? If law enforcement personnel have direct personal contact with an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, they should immediately use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, or with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. law enforcement personnel have direct personal contact with an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should also avoid touching law enforcement personnel have direct personal contact with an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 eyes, nose, and mouth. Any uniform items (or other surfaces) that were potentially exposed should be disinfected or cleaned as soon as feasible. For example, the duty belt or other non-porous items can be disinfected using products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 . Porous items, like the uniform, should be replaced as soon as possible and then laundered according to manufacturers’ recommendations. This is especially important if any body fluids were expelled during the encounter (bloodborne pathogen protocols should also be followed if applicable). Gloves should be worn when touching potentially contaminated items or applying disinfectants and it is important to perform hand hygiene upon removing gloves or other PPE.</data>

			<data>Law enforcement personnel who have an exposure should be evaluated by their occupational health program and may be able to finish their work shift before starting home isolation. If personnel and resources are available, it is most protective for law enforcement personnel to stay at home until 14 days after exposure to an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 if the exposure was prolonged (10 minutes or more) or if the exposure was of concern (e. g., an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 coughed into the face of the law enforcement officer). This would best protect the health of the exposed worker, their co-workers, and the general public. However, if personnel and resources are not available, law enforcement personnel (considered critical infrastructure workers) may be permitted to work after exposure to ensure continuity of operations. To continue working, the exposed worker should remain symptom-free, and the employer should put into place the following Screen the worker for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before each work shift Regularly monitor the exposed worker for symptoms, under the supervision of an occupational health program Ensure the worker practices social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet away from others) Ensure the worker wears a facemask (or cloth face covering if facemasks are unavailable) to protect others If an exposed worker develops symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath)  and is still working, the employer should: Send the worker home immediately and encourage the employer to follow *CDC guidance for What to Do If You Are Sick surfaces in their workspace. Follow *CDC guidance to determine when the worker can For more information, see *CDC’s updated guidance for Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Are first responders being prioritized for those who will be tested for COVID-19? are listed as high priority for getting tested for COVID-19 as part of *CDC’s Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 Should law enforcement agencies screen personnel for signs and symptoms of COVID-19? Law enforcement agencies should encourage all personnel to self-monitor for symptoms before they come to work. Workers who have (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should notify their supervisor and stay home. Workers who have (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) can also enter Workers who have (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) symptoms into the to determine whether Workers who have (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) need to seek medical care. Law enforcement agencies should ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with , and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. How can law enforcement agencies get personal protective equipment (PPE) when they are in short supply? *CDC is aware of shortages of PPE nationwide. Law enforcement leaders should contact their public health departments and emergency preparedness partners to discuss options. *CDC has developed strategies for optimizing the supply of PPE Are there additional precautions law enforcement personnel should take during death investigations? Upon entering a structure (home or place of business) where someone has died and COVID-19 is a suspected cause or contributing factor, law enforcement personnel should anticipate that others in that building could also be infected. If the cause of death is unknown, it would be most protective to assume that COVID-19 contributed. Law enforcement personnel should limit the number of personnel needed to enter that building, if feasible. If that building has not been cleared, law enforcement personnel should A single pair of disposable examination or higher level of protection (or a facemask if respirators are unavailable) (goggles or a disposable face shield). Further, law enforcement personnel should try to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet distance) with others at all times, especially while in the structure.</data>

			<data>If that building has been cleared, then that building may not be necessary to wear respiratory and eye protection, unless there are other hazards present that dictate their use according to an onsite hazard/risk assessment. Law enforcement personnel should be careful not to touch potentially contaminated surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Law enforcement should avoid direct contact with someone who has died of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 Every jurisdiction is different, but law enforcement personnel, in general, should not move or transport a body. Consult with the medical examiner/coroner’s office to determine the appropriate next steps and protective measures for that jurisdiction. the medical examiner/coroner’s office can decide who will transport the decedent. When the investigation is over, law enforcement personnel should take the following steps: Safely remove gloves and other PPE and properly dispose of them according to existing policies and procedures. Law enforcement personnel should be trained on the proper donning and doffing of PPE Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. If other reusable items (e. g., such as duty belt or gear) come into contact with individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, disinfect those items according to the manufacturers’ instructions. For disinfection, most EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available If law enforcement takes a person into custody who exhibits symptoms of COVID-19, where should they take the person for intake processing (such as jail, hospital, or some other facility)? All persons taken into custody should be given a facemask or cloth face covering to wear as part of . A facemask or cloth face covering may help protect others nearby if these people are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. If a person taken into custody exhibits of COVID-19 (cough, fever, or shortness of breath), the person should be assessed for transport to a healthcare facility for further evaluation and management. Medical evaluation during intake processing may be necessary, especially if COVID-19 is suspected. If, at any point, it is determined that the person taken into custody needs medical care, transportation should be coordinated with EMS providers and the receiving healthcare facility. If a person taken into custody does not show any symptoms of COVID-19, he or she should still be isolated as much as feasible during intake processing. *CDC has additional guidance for correctional and detention facilities that may be useful. Should law enforcement personnel and other first responders take additional precautions when coming home, even if they have no symptoms of COVID-19, to avoid potentially exposing household members? *CDC recommends that law enforcement personnel practice to protect *CDC household members from becoming ill.</data>

			<data>These measures include: disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily Many law enforcement personnel routinely change out of their uniforms at the station and wear street clothes and shoes home. Laundry services for uniforms may be provided by law enforcement agencies. Continuing this practice may help minimize the potential of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19 and other potential take-home exposures. Law enforcement personnel should perform after changing out of uniforms. Law enforcement personnel also should have a plan for household members who are at higher risk for severe illness Is there any specific guidance for protecting police canines from COVID-19 exposure? We are still learning about the virus, but the virus appears that the virus can spread from people to animals in some situations. Therefore, *CDC recommends that people sick with COVID-19 restrict contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. If a police canine that has been exposed to a person or setting with COVID-19 develops a new illness, contact your veterinary clinic and let them know that a working dog with a COVID-19 exposure has developed a new illness. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care. For more information, please see *CDC’s Do not use products not approved for use on animals to try to clean a police canine’s fur or paws. General Business Frequently Asked Questions What should I do if an employee comes to work with COVID-19 symptoms? when they arrive at work or become sick during the day should immediately be separated from other employees, customers, and visitors and sent home. Employees who develop symptoms outside of work should notify their supervisor and stay home. Sick employees should follow to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Employees should not return to work until they have met the criteria to and have consulted with a healthcare provider. Employers should not require sick employees to provide a COVID-19 test result or healthcare provider’s note to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner. What should I do if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19? In most cases, you do not need to shut down your facility.

Be sure to follow the instructions on the product labels to ensure safe and effective use of the product. You may need to wear additional personal protective equipment (PPE) depending on the setting and disinfectant product you are using. In addition to cleaning and disinfecting, employers should determine which employees may have been exposed to the virus and need to take additional precautions: If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Employees who test positive for COVID-19 (using a viral test, not an antibody test) should be excluded from work and if they do not need to be hospitalized. Employers should provide education to employees on what to do if they are sick Employers may need to work with local health department officials to determine which employees may have had close contact with the employee with COVID-19 and who may need to take , including exclusion from work and remaining at home. Most workplaces should follow the Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure and instruct potentially exposed employees to stay home for 14 days, telework if possible, and self-monitor for Critical infrastructure workplaces should follow the guidance Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Employees Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Sick employees should follow .

Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Employees Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 COVID-19 Critical Infrastructure Sector Response Planning What testing does *CDC recommend for employees in a workplace? *CDC does NOT recommend that employers use to determine which employees can work. Antibody tests check a blood sample for with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. *CDC does not yet know if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again check a respiratory sample (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) for for consideration of incorporating viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 into a workplace COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan. Different states and jurisdictions may have their own guidance and priorities for viral testing in workplaces. Testing in the workplace could be arranged through a company’s occupational health provider or in consultation with the local or state health department. What should I do if I find out several days later, after an employee worked, that they were diagnosed with COVID-19? If it has been since an employee used the facility, clean and disinfect all areas used by an employee following the *CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations If it has been since an employee used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routinely cleaning and disinfecting all high-touch surfaces in the facility. Other employees may have been exposed to the virus if they were in “close contact” (within approximately 6 feet) of the sick employee for a prolonged period of time. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

It has a series of questions and recommends what level of medical care, if any, the user should seek. It is not intended to provide diagnosis or treatment. “Acute” respiratory illness is an infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract that may interfere with normal breathing, such as COVID-19. “Acute” means of recent onset (for example, for a few days), and is used to distinguish from chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Are allergy symptoms considered an acute respiratory illness? No. Allergy symptoms are not considered an acute respiratory illness. However, there is some overlap between common seasonal allergy symptoms and some of the symptoms that have been reported by people with COVID-19 (e. g., headache, sneezing, cough). It is important to take into account whether an individual’s symptoms are compatible with the usual symptoms and timing for allergy in that person. How do I keep employees who interact with customers safe? To keep your employees safe, you should: Consider options to increase physical space between employees and customers such as opening a drive- through, erecting partitions, and marking floors to guide spacing at least 6 feet apart. At least once a day, surfaces that are frequently touched by multiple people. This includes door handles, desks, phones, light switches, and faucets. Consider assigning a person to rotate throughout the workplace to clean and disinfect surfaces.</data>

If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Consider scheduling a relief person to give cashiers and service desk employees an opportunity to wash their hands. Additional information on how to keep employees safe can be found in the CDC Guidance for Businesses and Employers What can be done to protect employees who cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from other employees or customers? Evaluate your workplace to identify situations where employees cannot maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other and/or customers. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the to addresses situations where employees cannot maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other and/or customers to limit the spread of COVID-19. A committee of both employees and management may be the most effective way to recognize all of these scenarios. It is important to note that control recommendations or interventions assigned to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following: Alter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Make sure the workspace is Change the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so employees are not facing each other. Consider making foot traffic one-way in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance. Set up, where possible, physical barriers between employees, and between employees and customers. Use strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions. Move electronic payment terminals/credit card readers farther away from the cashier to increase the distance between the customer and the cashier. Use visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind employees to maintain distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas. Consider these cues for customers as well, such as at the entrance or checkout line. Place handwashing stations or with at least 60% alcohol throughout the workplace for employees and customers. Use touch-free stations where possible. Make sure restrooms are well-stocked with soap and paper towels.</data>

			<data>Provide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. All employees should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, , and ways to prevent or minimize the spread. Trainings should cover the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet), , not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching the face, mouth, or eyes. Employees should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. Use cloth face coverings as appropriate. Recommend employees wear a Cloth face coverings are intended to protect other people—not the wearer. employees are not considered PPE. Train employees how to put on and take off cloth face coverings Cloth face coverings should be washed and dried after each use. Cloth face coverings should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (e. g., interferes with driving or vision, contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their benefit of slowing the spread of the virus. Recommend that visitors to the workplace (service personnel, customers) also wear cloth face coverings. PPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because PPE is harder to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why administrative and engineering controls are emphasized in guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19. In the current pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N-95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare employees and other medical first responders, as recommended by current unless they were required for the job before the pandemic. How can I help protect employees who may be at higher risk for severe illness? Have conversations with employees if they express concerns. Some people may be at higher risk of severe illness (65 years and older) and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions. By using strategies that help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, you will help protect all employees, including those at higher risk. strategies that help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace include: Implementing telework and other social distancing practices Actively encouraging employees to stay home when sick Providing supplies and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for cleaning and disinfecting workspaces Requiring all employees to wear cloth face coverings In workplaces where it is not possible to eliminate face-to-face contact (such as retail), consider assigning employees who are at higher risk of severe illness work tasks that allow them to maintain a 6-foot distance from others, if feasible.</data>

			<data>Employers should not require employees to provide a note from their healthcare provider when they are sick and instead allow them to inform their supervisors or employee health services when they have conditions that put them at higher risk for diseases. When is a cloth face covering not appropriate while at work, and what can employees wear instead? Cloth face coverings can prevent the wearer from spreading COVID-19 to others, but they may not always be appropriate. Employees should consider using an alternative under certain conditions at work, including: If they have trouble breathing. If Employees are unable to remove an alternative without help. If an alternative interferes with vision, glasses, or eye protection. If straps, strings, or other parts of the covering could get caught in equipment. If other work hazards associated with wearing the covering are identified and cannot be addressed without removal of the face covering. Cloth face coverings should be worn if their use creates a new risk (e. g., interferes with driving or vision, contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their benefit of slowing the spread of the virus. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration suggests that an employee wear a face shield if a cloth face covering is recommended but the employee cannot tolerate wearing a cloth face covering. If used, a face shield should cover the entire front and sides of the face and extend below the chin. What does source control mean? Source control is a term used to describe measures (e. g., cloth face coverings or face shields) intended to prevent people with COVID-19 from spreading the disease to others. COVID-19 is spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Evidence suggests that people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms can spread it to others without realizing they are infected. Cloth face coverings and face shields are types of source control that provide a barrier between droplets produced from a potentially infected person and other people, reducing the likelihood of transmitting the virus. Are cloth face coverings the same as personal protective equipment (PPE)? No, cloth face coverings are not PPE. cloth face coverings are not respirators and are not appropriate substitutes for cloth face coverings in workplaces where respirators are recommended or required for respiratory protection. How should cloth face coverings worn at work be handled, stored, and washed?</data>

			<data>, it should fit over the nose and mouth, fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, and be secured with ties or ear loops. The cloth face covering should allow the wearer to breathe without restriction. Employees should avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth as well as the inside or outside of the face covering while putting on, wearing, and removing it. When putting on and removing as well, Employees should only touch the ties or ear loops. If storing The cloth face covering while at work, employees should place the used cloth face covering into a container or paper bag labeled with the employee’s name. Cloth face coverings should not be shared with others unless they are washed and dried first. If The cloth face covering becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, The cloth face covering should be removed and stored to be laundered later. the employee should put on a clean cloth face covering or disposable face mask. If cloth face coverings are provided by the employer, a clean face covering should be issued to replace the soiled one. Employees should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings. If soap and water are not available, they should use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. instructions depend on the cloth used to make the face covering. In general, cloth face coverings should be washed regularly (e. g., daily after each shift) using water and a mild detergent and dried completely in a hot dryer. If a washing machine and dryer are not available, an alternative is to soak the face covering in a diluted bleach (0. 1%) solution, rinse, and air dry completely. Hands should be washed before laundering the cloth face coverings. How often should my employees wash Hands while at work? CDC recommends employees protect themselves from respiratory illness with everyday preventive actions, including good . Employees should wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available, especially during key times when persons are likely to be infected by or spread germs: Before and after the work shift Before and after work breaks After touching objects that have been handled by customers or other employees What can I tell my employees about reducing the spread of COVID-19 at work?

			<data>Stay home if sick, except to get medical care. Practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet away from fellow co-employees, customers, and visitors when possible. Wear cloth face coverings, especially when social distancing is not possible. Employees should inform their supervisor if they or their colleagues develop should be present at the workplace. Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing noses, , or having been in a public place. Use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. To the extent possible, avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places – elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, etc. Where possible, avoid direct physical contact such as shaking hands with people. Minimize handling cash, credit cards, and mobile or electronic devices when possible. Should we be screening employees for COVID-19 symptoms (such as temperature checks)? What is the best way to do that? Screening employees is an optional strategy that employers may use. Performing screening or health checks will not be completely effective because asymptomatic individuals or individuals with mild non-specific symptoms may not realize they are infected and may pass through screening. Screening and health checks are not a replacement for other protective measures such as social distancing. Consider encouraging individuals planning to enter the workplace to self-screen prior to coming onsite and not to attempt to enter the workplace if any of the following are present: Fever equal to or higher than 100. 4 Are under evaluation for COVID-19 (for example, waiting for the results of a viral test to confirm infection) Have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and not yet cleared to discontinue isolation *A lower temperature threshold (e. g., 100. 0 If you decide to actively screen employees for symptoms rather than relying on self-screening, consider which symptoms to include in your assessment. Although there are many different symptoms that may be associated with COVID-19 , you may not want to treat every employee with a single non-specific symptom (e. g., a headache) as a suspect case of COVID-19 and send them home until they meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation . Consider focusing the screening questions on “new” or “unexpected” symptoms (e. g., a chronic cough would not be a positive screen). Consider including these symptoms: Fever or feeling feverish (chills, sweating) Muscle aches or body aches New loss of taste or smell There are several methods that employers can use to protect the employee conducting the screening.</data>

Then: Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue, and confirm that the employee is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check . If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before each check. If non-contact thermometers are used, you should clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies. After each screening or after several screenings, where you did not have physical contact with an individual, remove and discard PPE (gloves) and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. How do I handle personal protective equipment (PPE (gloves)) waste? Discard PPE (gloves) into a trash can. Facility waste does not need disinfection. What is social distancing and how can my workplace do that? Social distancing means avoiding and maintaining distance (at least 6 feet) from others when possible. Strategies that businesses could use include: Allowing flexible work hours (such as staggered shifts) Increasing physical space between employees at the worksite Increasing physical space between employees and customers (such as a drive-through and partitions) Implementing flexible meeting and travel options (such as postponing non-essential meetings or events) Delivering products through curbside pick-up or delivery I don’t provide paid sick leave to my employees. What should I do? Employers that do not currently offer sick leave to some or all of their employees may want to draft non-punitive “emergency sick leave” policies. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) requires certain employers to provide their employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are eligible for 100% tax credits for Families First Coronavirus ​Response Act COVID-19 paid leave provided through December 31, 2020, up to certain limits. Should I require employees to provide a doctor’s note or positive Families First Coronavirus ​Response Act COVID-19 test result? Employers should not require sick employees to provide a Families First Coronavirus ​Response Act COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider’s note to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely manner.</data>

			<data>Should I cancel my meetings and conferences? Carefully consider whether travel is necessary and use videoconferencing or teleconferencing when possible for work-related meetings and gatherings. Employers should consider canceling, adjusting, or postponing large work-related meetings or gatherings that can only occur in-person. Follow CDC guidance for events and mass gatherings and consider resuming non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance. When videoconferencing or teleconferencing is not possible, hold meetings in open, well-ventilated spaces, and space chairs at least 6 feet apart. Encourage staff and attendees to stay home if sick. What measures should be taken to protect an employee who must travel for work? should be minimized as much as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic, many jobs require travel, and it may not be possible to conduct certain job duties using virtual tools. The following measures may be taken to protect employees while traveling: Schedule travel to limit the distance travelled and need for overnight lodging. If multi-day travel is necessary, coordinate with travel preparers to identify hotels that disinfect rooms between stays and regularly disinfect surfaces in common areas. Provide employees with forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others such as fleet vehicles or rental vehicles. If public transportation is used, ask employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using transportation If flying is necessary, select seats on flights that provide the greatest distance between other travelers and choose direct flights, if possible. Disinfect surfaces of rental cars or fleet vehicles (e. g., steering wheel, shifter, arm rests, etc. ) between each use, using products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 Make sure employees are provided with the necessary supplies and understand protective measures they can take while traveling. protective measures they can take while traveling include: Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other people (social distancing) as much as possible during travel. when a distance of 6 feet is difficult to maintain, such as in airports, airplanes, and public transportation. Use disinfecting wipes to clean commonly touched surfaces inside vehicles and airplanes. Consider ordering food for pickup or delivery rather than eating out at restaurants. Wash hands or use hand sanitizer regularly. Ensure that employees know that if they get sick they should stay home (not travel) or return home (if traveling) provided it is feasible for employees to travel without endangering employees or others.</data>

			<data>Make sure employees know who to contact if they are sick. CDC guidance for travel in the United States How do I clean and disinfect machinery or equipment? Current evidence, though still preliminary, suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. If the machinery or equipment in question are not accessible to employees or have not been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19, they will not present an exposure hazard. If machinery or equipment are thought to be contaminated and can be cleaned, follow the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations . First, clean dirty surfaces with soap and water. Second, disinfect surfaces using products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 and are appropriate for the surface. If machinery or equipment are thought to be contaminated and be cleaned, they can be isolated. Isolate papers or any soft (porous) surfaces for a minimum of 24 hours before handling. After 24 hours, remove soft materials from the area and clean the hard (non-porous) surfaces per the cleaning and disinfection recommendations. Isolate hard (non-porous) surfaces that cannot be for a minimum of 7 days before handling. How can I safely use cleaning chemicals? safe work practices when using cleaning chemicals Always wear gloves appropriate for the chemicals being used when you are cleaning and disinfecting. Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be needed based on the setting and product you are using. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleaner. Make sure that employees know which cleaning chemicals must be diluted and how to correctly dilute the cleaners they are using. Employers must ensure employees are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA’s Hazard Communication standard ( Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, application method, and contact time. In addition to cleaning and disinfecting, what can I do to decrease the spread of disease in my workplace? Provide soap and water in my workplace.</data>

			<data>If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. If hands are visibly dirty, soap and water should be chosen over hand sanitizer. Place hand sanitizer in multiple locations to encourage good that encourage staying home when sick, the importance of , and coughing and sneezing etiquette at the entrance to your workplace and in other workplace areas where employees are likely to see them. Should I adjust my ventilation system? The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 through ventilation systems has not been studied but is likely low. Routine HVAC maintenance is recommended. Although Routine HVAC maintenance is never the first line of prevention, consider general ventilation adjustments in your workplace, such as increasing ventilation and increasing the amount of outdoor air used by my ventilation system. Maintain the indoor air temperature and humidity at comfortable levels for building occupants. How should restrooms be cleaned and disinfected? CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have jointly developed guidance for cleaning and disinfecting public spaces , including restrooms. Employers should develop a plan for routine cleaning and disinfection, including the regular cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs, faucets, toilets, and other restroom furnishings. Custodial staff should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the setting and cleaning product they are using. To protect your staff and ensure that the products are used effectively, staff should be instructed on how to apply the disinfectants according to label instructions and precautions. Consider posting a cleaning schedule in the restrooms and marking off when each round of cleaning is completed. If I shut down my facility as a result of a COVID-19 case or outbreak, what is the recommended way to clean and disinfect, and what is the appropriate timeframe to resume operations? Follow CDC guidance for Wait 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas including offices, bathrooms, and common areas, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. Clean dirty surfaces with soap and water prior to disinfection.</data>

			<data>products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-Cov-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19, and that are appropriate for the surface. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, application method, contact time, and required PPE. Operations can resume as soon as the cleaning and disinfection are completed. How do I know if my business is considered critical? The Department of Homeland Security developed a of essential critical infrastructure employees to help state and local officials as they work to protect their communities, while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety as well as economic and national security. State and local officials make the final determinations for their jurisdictions about critical infrastructure employees. Should I allow critical infrastructure employees to work if they have been exposed but are not showing symptoms of COVID-19? is imperative during the response to the COVID-19 emergency, for both public health and safety as well as community well-being. When continuous remote work is not possible, critical infrastructure businesses should use strategies to reduce the likelihood of spreading the disease. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days and implementing social distancing. These steps can preserve and protect the workforce and allow operations to continue. To ensure continuity of operations of essential functions, CDC advises that may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided CDC remain asymptomatic and additional safety practices are implemented to protect CDC and the community. However, reintegrating exposed, asymptomatic employees to onsite operations, while discussed in the critical infrastructure guidance, should not be misinterpreted as always being the first or most appropriate option to pursue in managing critical work tasks. Staying home may still be the most preferred and protective option for exposed employees. Critical infrastructure businesses have an obligation to limit, to the extent possible, the reintegration of in-person employees who have experienced an exposure to COVID-19 but remain symptom-free in ways that best protect the health of the employee, their co-employees, and the general public. Create a critical infrastructure sector response plan . Cross-training employees to perform critical job functions so the workplace can operate even if key employees are absent and match critical job functions with other equally skilled and available employees who have not experienced an exposure to COVID-19. Critical infrastructure employees who have been exposed but remain symptom-free and must return to in-person work should adhere to the following practices before and during their work shift: Employees with symptoms should be sent home and should not return to the workplace until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Employees Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Is other specific CDC guidance available for critical infrastructure workplaces? CDC has guidance for first responders and law enforcement as well as a for specific critical infrastructure employee groups. Unless otherwise specified, the CDC interim guidance for businesses and employers applies to critical infrastructure workplaces as well.</data>

			<data>Preguntas frecuentes relativas a la prevención y el control de infecciones asociadas a la atención médica para el COVID-19 Las recomendaciones provisionales de los CDC para la prevención y el control de infecciones asociadas al COVID-19, ¿se aplican a hospitales siquiátricos o a otros establecimientos de salud conductual? Sí. Para mantener la salud y la seguridad de los pacientes y del personal de atención médica (HCP), la guía de los CDC para la prevención y el control de infecciones se aplica a todos los entornos donde se ofrece atención médica. Sin embargo, como con cualquier guía, los establecimientos pueden adaptar ciertas recomendaciones a sus entornos. Por ejemplo, la atención siquiátrica con internación puede incluir experiencias colectivas y actividades grupales que quizás precisen continuar. Si es así, la adaptación de estas actividades podría ser necesaria para alinearlas con las recomendaciones del . Podría no ser seguro o adecuado implementar otras medidas recomendadas para el control de infecciones (por ejemplo, asegurar el acceso a desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol, agrupar a pacientes con COVID-19 y asignarles personal dedicado solo a ellos, o implementar medidas universales de control de fuente) en todos los lugares o para todos los pacientes debido a cuestiones de seguridad y comportamiento. Los desafíos y soluciones potenciales que son específicos a los entornos de salud conductual podrían incluir lo siguiente: Para prevenir la transmisión, generalmente se recomienda que los pacientes con COVID-19 sean transferidos a un área separada del establecimiento en donde puedan atenderlos HCP dedicados solo a ellos. Debido a problemas de seguridad o necesidades de atención especializada, tal vez no sea posible agrupar a ciertos pacientes o cambiar al HCP asignado para su atención. Cuando el agrupamiento no sea posible, implementar medidas para mantener el distanciamiento social (al menos 6 pies) entre los pacientes con COVID-19 y las otras personas en la unidad. Idealmente, esto incluiría un baño separado para los pacientes con COVID-19. Asegurarse de que el HCP use todo el equipo de protección personal (EPP) recomendado cuando atienda a  pacientes con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado. Sesiones de terapia grupal Las sesiones de consejería, terapia y discusión grupales son un componente esencial del tratamiento y planes de atención siquiátricos, pero la configuración tradicional para estas actividades no es compatible con las recomendaciones del distanciamiento social. Cuando sea posible, utilizar métodos virtuales o reducir el tamaño de los grupos para que se pueda mantener el distanciamiento social. En el caso de que haya transmisión del COVID-19 en el establecimiento, se deberán interrumpir las sesiones o pasar a un formato de foro de discusión en video hasta que se hayan implementado medidas adicionales de prevención de infecciones para detener la propagación. Cubiertas de tela para la cara En el caso de algunos pacientes, el uso de cubierta de tela para la cara o mascarillas podría presentar un peligro adicional o causar aflicción. Es posible que algunos pacientes no puedan o no quieran usarlas de la forma prevista. Las tiras elásticas o de tela pueden ser usadas para estrangularse a sí mismo o a otros, y los puentes nasales de metal pueden ser usados para lastimarse o como un arma.</data>

			<data>Pensar en la posibilidad de permitir el uso de cubiertas de tela para la cara o mascarillas —preferentemente las que tengan tiras cortas para atrás de las orejas en lugar de cintas largas— a los pacientes que tengan un bajo riesgo de utilizarlas de un modo indebido. Pensar en la posibilidad de usar cubiertas de tela para la cara o mascarillas durante las actividades grupales supervisadas. Asegurarse de que el HCP use protección para los ojos y una mascarilla cuando interactúe con pacientes que no puedan usar una cubierta de tela para la cara o mascarilla (o, si se trata de un paciente con COVID-19 presunto, Asegurarse de que el HCP use un respirador). Desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol Si bien los desinfectantes de manos que contienen entre un 60 y un 95 % de alcohol son una herramienta importante para la adhesión a las recomendaciones para la , estos desinfectantes deben usarse con cuidado en los establecimientos siquiátricos para asegurarse de que los pacientes no los ingieran. Pensar en la posibilidad de no ubicar Los desinfectantes de mano a base de alcohol en las habitaciones de pacientes en establecimientos siquiátricos, ni en los lugares a los que los pacientes tienen acceso sin supervisión. Fomentar el lavado frecuente de las manos con agua y jabón tanto en los pacientes como en el HCP. Pensar en la la posibilidad de proveerle al HCP dispensadores personales de bolsillo de desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol. Como parte del distanciamiento social, generalmente no se recomienda que las comidas se sirvan en comedores. Sin embargo, es necesario seguir supervisando a los pacientes mientras comen debido al potencial de que se lastimen a sí mismos con los cubiertos y porque los medicamentos siquiátricos que se usan comúnmente pueden causar efectos secundarios (p. ej. , discinesia tardía, disfagia, hipersalivación e hiposalivación) que aumentan el riesgo de atragantamiento de los pacientes. Una opción es colocar a miembros del personal en las habitaciones de los pacientes para que los supervisen mientras coman. Otra opción es permitir que los pacientes coman en el comedor por turnos para que el personal los pueda supervisar, asegurándose al mismo tiempo de que mantengan como mínimo 6 pies entre ellos. Una tercera opción es hacer que los pacientes se sienten en sillas que estén adecuadamente separadas en el pasillo, afuera de sus habitaciones, para que puedan ser supervisados mientras coman. Una mayor proporción de pacientes siquiátricos fuman cigarrillos en comparación con la población general. Los pacientes podrían reunirse en espacios al aire libre para fumadores sin practicar el distanciamiento social adecuado. Limitar la cantidad permitida de pacientes que accedan al mismo tiempo a los espacios para fumadores, o colocar a miembros del personal para que observen a los pacientes y se aseguren de que estén practicando el distanciamiento físico adecuado. Si un establecimiento de cuidados a largo plazo tiene un residente o un miembro del personal con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado, ¿cómo y a quién se debe comunicar esto? Los establecimientos deben cumplir con los requisitos de notificación de su estado o jurisdicción. Aquellos regulados por los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid (CMS) (p. ej. , Los hogares de ancianos) también deben cumplir con todos los , los cuales están siendo actualizados para incluir nuevos requisitos para notificar a los CDC, y a los residentes y sus representantes.</data>

			<data>Además, los sean notificados rápidamente sobre lo siguiente: residentes o miembros del personal de atención médica con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado, residentes con infección respiratoria grave que cause hospitalización o muerte, y ≥ 3 residentes o miembros del personal de atención médica con síntomas respiratorios de reciente aparición con una diferencia de menos de 72 horas entre uno y otro. Esto podría señalar un brote de COVID-19 o de otra enfermedad respiratoria en el establecimiento. El departamento de salud puede proveer orientación importante para asistir con la búsqueda de casos y detener la transmisión. El establecimiento también debe tener un plan y un mecanismo para comunicarse regularmente con los residentes, los familiares, y el personal de atención médica, incluso si se identifican casos de COVID-19 en el establecimiento. A menudo, la información en los hogares de ancianos se comunica a través de reuniones públicas y reuniones de personal, junto con cartas o mensajes electrónicos. Sin embargo, durante la pandemia de COVID-19, no se deben realizar reuniones en persona. En vez de eso, la comunicación debe ocurrir a través de reuniones virtuales por teléfono o en plataformas de Internet. Esto debería complementarse con comunicaciones por escrito que proporcionen la información de contacto de un miembro del personal que pueda responder las preguntas o inquietudes. Las comunicaciones también deben incluir información que describa la situación actual, los planes para limitar la propagación dentro del establecimiento y las medidas recomendadas que se puedan tomar para protegerse y proteger a los demás. Los establecimientos deben entregar esta información de manera oportuna y ofrecer actualizaciones periódicas a medida que la situación cambie y haya más información disponible. Antes de darle el alta a un paciente hospitalizado para que regrese a un hogar de ancianos, ¿es necesario que tenga una prueba de detección del SARS-CoV-2 —el virus que causa el COVID-19— con resultado negativo? . En el caso de los pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19, las decisiones sobre el alta hospitalaria deberán basarse en el del paciente y la capacidad que tenga el establecimiento que lo reciba para satisfacer sus necesidades de atención y adherirse a las prácticas recomendadas para la prevención y el control de infecciones. Las decisiones sobre el alta hospitalaria son diferentes de las decisiones sobre la interrupción de las precauciones por transmisión . En el caso de los pacientes con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado, las decisiones acerca de interrumpir las precauciones por transmisión deberán basarse en las estrategias delineadas la estrategia con base en la prueba de detección y quizás no sería posible debido a las limitaciones en la disponibilidad de las pruebas. Si un paciente con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado con los criterios para interrumpir las precauciones por transmisión, se lo deberá transferir a un establecimiento con la capacidad para adherirse a las recomendaciones para la prevención y el control de infecciones para la atención de los residentes con COVID-19, incluida la ubicación en una unidad o área del establecimiento destinadas al cuidado de residentes con COVID-19 y el suministro de equipo de protección personal recomendado al personal de atención médica. Si el paciente con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado con los criterios para interrumpir las precauciones por transmisión, pero síntomas persistentes (p. ej. , tos persistente), idealmente debería estar en una habitación individual, mantenerse confinado en esa habitación en la medida de lo posible, y usar una mascarilla (si la tolera) durante las actividades hasta que todos los síntomas estén completamente resueltos o a nivel normal. Si el paciente con los criterios para interrumpir las precauciones por transmisión y no síntomas persistentes, no se necesitan restricciones adicionales. un paciente hospitalizado por enfermedades que no están relacionadas con el COVID-19, cuya situación con respecto a esta última enfermedad es desconocida, puede ser transferido a un hogar de ancianos sin que se le haga una prueba de detección.</data>

			<data>No obstante, para asegurarse de que no esté infectado, se lo deberá ubicar en un área de observación separada o en una habitación individual dentro del hogar de ancianos, con hasta que hayan pasado 14 días desde la admisión. Como parte de las medidas universales de control de fuente , todos los residentes (incluidos aquellos descritos en las situaciones anteriores) deben usar una cubierta de tela para la cara o mascarilla (si la toleran) siempre que salgan de su habitación. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, ¿hay consideraciones especiales para los entornos quirúrgicos y de otros procedimientos, incluida la realización de procedimientos generadores de aerosoles (AGP, por sus siglas en inglés)? Como parte de las prácticas de rutina, El personal de atención médica (HCP) deberá aplicar las . EL HCP debe siempre evaluar deliberadamente los riesgos potenciales de exposición a materiales infecciosos antes de participar en actividades y procedimientos de atención médica. Con base en su evaluación de riesgo, deberá implementar —en el lugar donde brinde atención— prácticas laborales seguras, como controles de ingeniería que reduzcan la liberación de material infeccioso, controles administrativos y el uso de equipo de protección personal (EPP), de acuerdo con las directrices y estándares de práctica de los CDC para la actividad realizada. Para reducir la exposición al SARS-CoV-2 durante la pandemia del COVID-19, CDC recomiendan que los establecimientos realicen lo siguiente: tengan en cuenta enfoques no quirúrgicos cuando sea viable; minimicen el uso de procedimientos o técnicas que podrían producir aerosoles infecciosos, cuando sea viable; minimicen la cantidad de personas en el quirófano o la sala de procedimientos para reducir las exposiciones; usen los datos correspondientes al alcance de la transmisión comunitaria y una evaluación de las probabilidades de daño para el paciente si se demora la atención cuando deban decidir si cancelan o posponen las operaciones quirúrgicas y los procedimientos programados; y pongan en práctica medidas universales de control de fuente, que incluyen hacer que los pacientes usen una cubierta de tela para la cara (si la toleran) y hacer que el HCP use una mascarilla en todo momento mientras esté dentro del establecimiento de atención médica. Si un establecimiento de cuidados o los procedimientos no pueden posponerse, Asegurarse de que el HCP que atienda a pacientes con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado deberá adherirse a todas las prácticas recomendadas para la prevención y el control de infecciones en el caso del COVID-19 Usar todo el EPP recomendado: un respirador N95 o de nivel superior (o una mascarilla si no hay respiradores), protección para los ojos, guantes y una bata. No se deben usar los respiradores con válvulas de exhalación durante los procedimientos quirúrgicos puesto que el aliento exhalado sin filtrar comprometería el campo estéril. Si hay escasez de insumos, los respiradores N95 o de nivel superior deben ser priorizados para los procedimientos que involucren técnicas de mayor riesgo (como los que generan aerosoles potencialmente infecciosos) o que incluyan regiones anatómicas donde las cargas virales podrían ser más altas (p. ej. , nariz y garganta, orofaringe, aparato respiratorio). Como parte de las prácticas de rutina, el HCP también deberá usar controles de ingeniería adicionales para el control de fuente (p. ej. , dispositivos de evacuación de humo), cuando corresponda. Debido a que el COVID-19 puede transmitirse asintomáticamente, algunas personas infectadas no serán identificadas con base en los signos y síntomas. En el caso de la atención quirúrgica o en procedimientos provistos a pacientes que no se sospeche que tengan COVID-19, el HCP deberá usar un enfoque por niveles, con base en el nivel de transmisión comunitaria, para fundamentar la necesidad de usar protección para los ojos y un respirador (ver las preguntas frecuentes que abordan el EPP recomendado para la atención de un baño separado para los pacientes con COVID-19. Asegurarse de que el HCP debe continuar usando protección para los ojos o un respirador N95 o de nivel superior toda vez que se recomiende para la atención de pacientes como parte de las medidas de precaución estándar o por transmisión. ¿Por qué siguen recomendando los CDC un nivel de protección respiratoria equivalente o mayor al que provee un baño separado para los pacientes con COVID-19? La guía de los CDC de usar respiradores con mascarilla de filtrado desechable de nivel N95 o superior aprobados por NIOSH al atender a pacientes que se sabe o sospecha que tienen COVID-19 se basa en los conocimientos actuales sobre el SARS-CoV-2 y virus respiratorios relacionados. Los datos actuales parecen indicar que la transmisión de aerosoles a corta distancia a través de gotitas e inhalación, y el contacto seguido de autotransferencia a los ojos, la nariz o la boca son vías probables de transmisión. La transmisión de aerosoles a larga distancia, tal como se ve en el sarampión, no ha sido una característica del SARS-CoV-2.</data>
			<label></label>
		</doc>
		<doc>
			<url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</url>
			<data>Las potenciales vías de transmisión a corta distancia incluyen las salpicaduras y el rociado de material infeccioso a las membranas mucosas y la inhalación de viriones infecciosos exhalados por una persona infectada. La transmisión de contribución relativa de cada una de estas vías no se conoce para el SARS-Co-V-2. Las mascarillas que comúnmente se usan durante los procedimientos quirúrgicos proveerán una barrera de protección contra el contacto entre el rocío de gotitas y las membranas mucosas de la nariz y la boca, pero no están diseñadas para proteger al que las usa contra la inhalación de partículas pequeñas. Los respiradores con nivel de filtrado N95 o superior — como otros respiradores con mascarilla de filtrado desechables, Los respiradores purificadores de aire forzado (PAPR) y Los respiradores elastoméricos — proveen tanto una barrera como protección respiratoria debido a sus características de filtrado y de buen ajuste. Los respiradores deberían usarse como parte de un programa de protección que le provea al personal evaluaciones médicas, capacitación y pruebas de ajuste. Las mascarillas se usen rutinariamente para la atención médica de pacientes con infecciones respiratorias virales comunes, los respiradores de nivel N95 o superior se recomiendan de forma habitual para los patógenos emergentes como el SARS-Co-V-2, que tienen el potencial de transmisión vía partículas pequeñas, la capacidad de causar infecciones graves y para los cuales no hay tratamientos específicos o vacunas. Las recomendaciones de los CDC reconocen los desafíos actuales en relación con los suministros de respiradores N95 y otros. Los establecimientos que no tengan suministros suficientes de respiradores N95 y otros para toda la atención médica de pacientes deberían priorizar su uso para las actividades y los procedimientos que suponen el riesgo de generar aerosoles infecciosos y usar las mascarillas para la atención médica que no conlleve tales actividades o procedimientos. Hay estrategias para optimizar el suministro de respiradores N95 en entornos de atención médica detalladas en el sitio web de los CDC. La guía indica que, una vez que se restablezca la disponibilidad de suministros, se debe reanudar el uso de respiradores de nivel N95 o superior. ¿Qué equipo de protección personal (EPP) deben usar las personas que transporten dentro de un establecimiento de atención médica a pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado o que estén bajo investigación por COVID-19? Por ejemplo, ¿qué EPP se debe usar cuando se transporte a un paciente al departamento de radiología para las pruebas de imagen que no se puedan realizar en su habitación? En general, el transporte y movimiento de un paciente fuera de su habitación debería limitarse a los fines médicamente esenciales. Si un establecimiento de cuidados se transporta a un paciente fuera de la habitación, como a radiología, se deberá notificar con anticipación al personal de atención médica en el área que lo recibirá. Cuando sea transportado, el paciente deberá usar una mascarilla o una cubierta de tela para la cara para contener las secreciones y estar cubierto con una sábana limpia. Si un establecimiento de cuidados el personal a cargo del transporte debe preparar al paciente para su traslado (p. ej. , transferirlo a una silla de ruedas o a una camilla), este personal debe usar (guantes, bata, protección respiratoria —que como mínimo tenga el nivel de protección de un respirador con mascarilla de filtrado N95 desechable de ajuste comprobado, certificado por NIOSH o, si no hay un respirador disponible, una mascarilla— y protección para los ojos, es decir, gafas de protección o un protector facial desechable que cubra el frente y los costados de la cara). Esta recomendación es necesaria porque estas interacciones generalmente incluyen un contacto cercano, a menudo cara a cara, con el paciente en un espacio cerrado (p. ej. , la habitación del paciente). Una vez que el paciente haya sido transferido a la silla de ruedas o a la camilla (y antes de salir de la habitación), las personas que lo transporten deben quitarse la bata, los guantes y la protección para los ojos, e higienizarse las manos.</data>

			<data>Al personal de atención médica que transporta pacientes con infecciones respiratorias no se le recomienda generalmente que use EPP si el paciente estará usando una mascarilla o cubierta de tela para la cara cuando lo transporten desde su habitación hasta el lugar de destino. Sin embargo, debido a las actuales limitaciones en los conocimientos sobre el COVID-19 y siguiendo el enfoque cauteloso actual de estratificación del riesgo y monitoreo del personal de atención médica que se ocupe de pacientes con COVID-19 , se recomienda que quienes realicen el transporte usen una mascarilla para todo lo que implique más que un breve encuentro con pacientes con COVID-19. No se debe requerir EPP adicional a menos de que se prevea la necesidad de suministrar asistencia médica durante el transporte (p. ej. , ayudar al paciente a remplazar una mascarilla que se le haya salido). Después de llegar a su destino, el personal que reciba al paciente (p. ej. , en radiología) y la persona que realizó el transporte (si ayuda con la transferencia) deben higienizarse las manos y usar . Si un establecimiento de cuidados todavía está usando la mascarilla o el respirador original, la persona que transportó al paciente debe ser cuidadosa para evitar contaminarse a sí misma al ponerse el resto del EPP recomendado. Este enfoque cauteloso se perfeccionará y actualizará a medida que se disponga de más información y las necesidades de respuesta cambien en los Estados Unidos. La guía interina para el personal de servicios médicos de emergencia que transporte a pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado o presunto está . El personal de servicios médicos de emergencia debe usar todo el EPP recomendado porque está suministrando atención médica directa y en contacto cercano con el paciente por periodos más prolongados. Dado el potencial de transmisión asintomática del SARS-CoV-2, ¿qué equipo de protección personal (EPP) debe usar el personal de atención médica (HCP) que provea cuidado a pacientes que no se sospeche que tengan COVID-19? El potencial de transmisión asintomática del SARS-CoV-2 acentúa la importancia de aplicar prácticas preventivas en todos los pacientes, como el distanciamiento social, la higiene de manos, la descontaminación de superficies y hacer que los pacientes usen una cubierta de tela para la cara o mascarilla (para el control de fuente) mientras se encuentren en un establecimiento de atención médica. Para proteger a los pacientes y a los compañeros de trabajo, el HCP debe usar una mascarilla en todo momento mientras esté en el establecimiento de atención médica (es decir, practicar el control de fuente). Se recomienda El personal de servicios médicos de emergencia debe usar use una mascarilla, en lugar de una cubierta de tela para la cara, puesto que la mascarilla ofrece control de fuente y protección al exponerse a salpicaduras y rociado de material infeccioso de otras personas. El HCP que atienda o brinde cuidados a pacientes con COVID-19 presunto o confirmado debe continuar usando guantes, bata, protección respiratoria —que como mínimo tenga el nivel de protección de un respirador con mascarilla de filtrado N95 desechable de ajuste comprobado, certificado por NIOSH o, si no hay un respirador disponible, una mascarilla— y protección para los ojos (es decir, gafas de protección o un protector facial desechable que cubra el frente y los costados de la cara). El HCP que trabaje en establecimientos ubicados en áreas con transmisión comunitaria de moderada a considerable tiene más probabilidad de hallarse frente a pacientes asintomáticos con COVID-19. Si un paciente se presenta para ser atendido y no se sospecha que tenga COVID-19 (según los síntomas y antecedentes de exposición), el HCP deberá tomar las si es necesario, con base en el diagnóstico presunto). También deberá: Usar protección para los ojos además de la mascarilla para garantizar que los ojos, la nariz y la boca estén protegidos de las salpicaduras y rociados de material infeccioso de otras personas. Usar un respirador N95 o de nivel superior, en lugar de una mascarilla, para los siguientes casos: Procedimientos que generan aerosoles (ver la sección de preguntas y respuestas sobre cuáles procedimientos son considerados como generadores de aerosoles en entornos de atención médica Los procedimientos quirúrgicos que podrían presentar un mayor riesgo de transmisión si el paciente tiene COVID-19 (p. ej. , que generan aerosoles potencialmente infecciosos o incluyen regiones anatómicas donde las cargas virales podrían ser más altas, como la nariz y la garganta, orofaringe, aparato respiratorio) (ver las preguntas frecuentes relativas a cirugías Los respiradores con válvulas de exhalación no se recomiendan para el control de fuente y no deben usarse durante los procedimientos quirúrgicos ya que el aliento exhalado sin filtrar comprometería el campo estéril.</data>

			<data>En el caso del HCP que trabaje en áreas con transmisión comunitaria mínima o inexistente, son opcionales las recomendaciones universales de protección para los ojos y un respirador (descrito antes) correspondientes a áreas con transmisión comunitaria de moderada a considerable. Sin embargo, el HCP debe continuar usando protección para los ojos o un respirador desechable de nivel N95 o de nivel superior toda vez que se recomiende para la atención de pacientes como parte de las medidas de precaución estándar o por transmisión. Se recomienda al HCP El uso universal de una mascarilla para el control de fuente. En función de la disponibilidad de pruebas y de la rapidez con que se puedan conseguir los resultados, Los establecimientos también pueden tener en cuenta la implementación de pruebas de detección del COVID-19 durante el proceso de admisión o antes de un procedimiento. Los resultados de las pruebas podrían fundamentar las decisiones para el uso universal de protección para los ojos y respiradores, según lo indicado antes, especialmente si hay escasez de EPP. Las limitaciones presentadas por el uso de esta estrategia (hacer pruebas) incluye la obtención de resultados negativos en pacientes que estén en el periodo de incubación y que luego se tornen infecciosos, y los resultados falsos negativos, según sea el método de análisis utilizado. Definiciones: : transmisión comunitaria a gran escala, como en entornos comunitarios (p. ej. , escuelas, lugares de trabajo) Transmisión comunitaria de mínima a moderada: transmisión sostenida con gran probabilidad de exposición, o exposición confirmada, dentro de los entornos comunitarios y potencial para el aumento rápido de casos. Transmisión comunitaria mínima o inexistente: evidencia de casos aislados o de transmisión comunitaria limitada, investigaciones de casos en marcha; no hay evidencia de exposición en un entorno comunitario de grandes dimensiones. ¿Qué equipo de protección personal (EPP) debe usar el personal de servicios ambientales que limpie y desinfecte las habitaciones de los pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19? En general, solo el personal esencial debería ingresar a la habitación de pacientes con COVID-19. Los establecimientos de atención médica deben considerar la asignación de la limpieza y desinfección diaria de las superficies de contacto frecuente al personal de enfermería que ya estará en la habitación atendiendo al paciente. Si se le asigna esta responsabilidad al personal de servicios ambientales, deberán usar todo el cuando estén en la habitación. EPP deberá quitarse una vez que se haya salido de la habitación, e inmediatamente después se deberán higienizar las manos. Después del alta, El personal de servicios ambientales podrá realizar la limpieza terminal. Deberá demorar el ingreso a la habitación hasta que haya transcurrido el tiempo suficiente para que bastantes cambios de aire eliminen las partículas potencialmente infecciosas. Todavía no sabemos por cuánto tiempo el SARS-CoV-2 permanece infeccioso en el aire. Independientemente de eso, El personal de servicios ambientales debe evitar ingresar a la habitación desocupada hasta que haya transcurrido el tiempo suficiente para que bastantes cambios de aire eliminen las partículas potencialmente infecciosas (hay más información en tasas de remoción bajo condiciones de ventilación diversas ). Después de que haya transcurrido ese tiempo, el personal de servicios ambientales puede entrar a la habitación y debe usar una bata y guantes al realizar la limpieza terminal. Se deberá agregar una mascarilla (si no se usa ya para El control de fuentes) y protección para los ojos si se prevé que habrá salpicaduras o rociamiento durante las actividades de limpieza y desinfección, o si de algún otro modo se requieren debido a los productos de limpieza seleccionados.</data>

			<data>En estos momentos no se le está recomendando usar cubrezapatos al personal que esté atendiendo a pacientes con COVID-19. En los entornos de atención médica, ¿cuáles procedimientos son considerados como generadores de aerosoles? Algunos procedimientos que se les realiza a los pacientes tienen más probabilidad de generar concentraciones más altas de aerosoles respiratorios infecciosos, que las que se producen al toser, estornudar, hablar o respirar. Estos procedimientos generadores de aerosoles (AGP, por sus siglas en inglés) ponen al personal de atención médica y a otras personas potencialmente en mayor riesgo de exposición a patógenos e infección. No ha sido posible crear una lista exhaustiva de los AGP para los entornos de atención médica debido a las limitaciones en los datos disponibles en cuanto a cuáles procedimientos podrían generar aerosoles potencialmente infecciosos, y a las dificultades para determinar si las transmisiones reportadas durante los AGP se debieron a aerosoles o a otras exposiciones. No hay consenso de expertos ni suficientes datos de respaldo para crear una lista definitiva y exhaustiva de los AGP para los entornos de atención médica. Los procedimientos médicos realizados comúnmente, que con frecuencia son considerados como AGP, incluyen: succión abierta de vías respiratorias Con base en los limitados datos disponibles, no se sabe con certeza si podrían ser infecciosos los aerosoles generados por algunos procedimientos, como, por ejemplo: administración de medicamentos por nebulizador* administración de oxígeno de alto flujo *Los aerosoles generados por los nebulizadores se derivan del medicamento en el nebulizador. No se sabe con certeza si las potenciales asociaciones entre la realización de este procedimiento común y un mayor riesgo de infección podrían deberse a los aerosoles generados por el procedimiento o al mayor contacto entre quienes administran el medicamento nebulizado y los pacientes infectados. Referencias relacionadas con los procedimientos generadores de aerosoles: Tran K, Cimon K, Severn M, Pessoa-Silva CL, Conly J (2012) Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review. PLoS ONE 7(4); ¿Dónde deberían realizarse las pruebas de hisopado nasofaríngeo a pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado o presunto, y con qué EPP? La obtención de hisopados nasofaríngeos de pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado o presunto puede realizarse en una sala de atención de pacientes común con la puerta cerrada. No se requiere el uso de una sala de aislamiento por infecciones de transmisión por vía aérea para obtener las muestras nasofaríngeas. El personal de atención médica que esté en la sala debe usar un respirador N95 o superior (o una mascarilla si no hay un respirador disponible), protección para los ojos, guantes y una bata. Si los respiradores no están fácilmente disponibles, deben ser priorizados para otros procedimientos con mayor riesgo de producir aerosoles infecciosos (p. ej. , intubación), en lugar de usarlos para realizar los hisopados nasofaríngeos. ¿Es necesario que todos los pacientes con COVID-19 confirmado o presunto sean ubicados en salas de aislamiento por infecciones de transmisión por vía aérea? Recomendaciones provisionales para la prevención y el control de infecciones en pacientes con enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) confirmada o presunta en entornos de atención médica aconsejan ubicar a los pacientes en una sala de atención de pacientes común con la puerta cerrada. Las salas de aislamiento por infecciones de transmisión por vía aérea deben reservarse para pacientes sometidos a procedimientos que generen aerosoles o para fines de diagnóstico, como tuberculosis activa.</data>

			<data>¿Por cuánto tiempo debe permanecer desocupada una sala de atención de pacientes después de haber sido ocupada por un paciente con COVID-19 confirmado o presunto? Si bien se cree que la propagación del SARS-CoV-2 se produce principalmente a través de las gotitas respiratorias, la contribución de pequeñas partículas respirables a la transmisión por la gran proximidad actualmente es incierta. La transmisión por vía aérea de persona a persona a grandes distancias es poco probable. La cantidad de tiempo que el aire adentro de la sala de atención de pacientes permanece potencialmente infeccioso es desconocida y podría depender de un número de factores que incluyen el tamaño de la sala, la cantidad de cambios de aire por hora, cuánto tiempo el paciente estuvo en la sala, si el paciente estuvo tosiendo o estornudando, y si se realizó un procedimiento que generó aerosoles. Los establecimientos de atención médica tendrán que considerar estos factores al decidir cuándo alguien que no esté usando EPP puede entrar en la sala desocupada. En el caso de un paciente que no estuvo tosiendo ni estornudando, no fue sometido a un procedimiento que generó aerosoles, y ocupó la sala por un corto periodo (p. ej. , unos minutos), cualquier riesgo para el personal de atención médica y los pacientes subsiguientes probablemente se disipará en una cuestión de minutos. Sin embargo, en el caso de un paciente que estuvo tosiendo y que se quedó en la sala por un largo periodo, o fue sometido a un procedimiento que generó aerosoles, el periodo de riesgo probablemente sea más largo. Para estas situaciones de mayor riesgo, es razonable aplicar un periodo similar al que se usa en el caso de la propagación de patógenos por vía aérea (p. ej. , sarampión, tuberculosis) y restringir el ingreso de personal de atención médica y de pacientes sin EPP a la sala hasta que haya transcurrido el tiempo suficiente para que bastantes cambios de aire eliminen las partículas potencialmente infecciosas. Hay disponible una guía general sobre tasas de remoción bajo condiciones de ventilación diversas Además de asegurarse de que haya transcurrido el tiempo suficiente para que bastantes cambios de aire eliminen las partículas potencialmente infecciosas, el personal de atención médica debe limpiar y desinfectar las superficies ambientales y el equipo compartido antes de que la sala sea usada para otro paciente. En mi hospital hay escasez de batas de aislamiento. Para preservar nuestros suministros, ¿podemos dejar de usarlas cuando atendamos a pacientes con resistentes a la meticilina (SARM) y otros organismos endémicos multirresistentes (MDRO), y Los CDC han difundido información acerca de las estrategias para optimizar el suministro de batas de aislamiento . Los establecimientos de atención médica deben remitirse a esas directrices e implementar las estrategias recomendadas para optimizar sus suministros actuales de batas. Esto incluye pasar a usar batas de tela lavables, si es viable. El uso de batas como parte de las precauciones de contacto en el contexto de los MDRO se ha implementado principalmente para reducir el riesgo de transmisión a otros pacientes, y no para proteger al personal de atención médica. Los establecimientos que tengan escasez de batas podrían considerar la suspensión de su uso para la atención de pacientes con MDRO de carácter endémico, como SARM, ERV y bacilos gramnegativos productores de ESBL, con excepción de lo requerido por las . Los establecimientos deben evaluar su epidemiología local para determinar cuáles MDRO se consideran endémicos. Independientemente del uso de batas, El personal de atención médica debe continuar usando guantes para el contacto con estos pacientes y su entorno. Se debe continuar enfatizando la higiene de las manos.</data>

			<data>Los establecimientos también deben intentar colocar a los pacientes colonizados o infectados por un MDRO en habitaciones privadas, si están disponibles. Atención de pacientes que tengan organismos gramnegativos altamente resistentes (p. ej. , enterobacterias resistentes a los carbapenemes) y otros MDRO (p. ej. , ) que no se consideren endémicos: Las batas deberían reservarse —en lugar de ponerse una cada vez que se ingrese en una habitación— para ser usadas como parte las y también priorizarse para las actividades de alto contacto que forman parte de la atención del paciente y que constituyen el riesgo más alto de transferencia de patógenos del paciente al personal de atención médica. Ejemplos de estas actividades de alto contacto incluyen vestir, bañar o duchar, transferir, higienizar, cambiar sábanas, cambiar la ropa interior o ayudar para usar el baño, cuidado o uso de dispositivos (vía central, sonda urinaria, tubo de alimentación, traqueostomía o respirador) y cuidado de heridas. Para preservar las batas aún más, se recomienda que el personal de atención médica agrupe las actividades de alto contacto que formen parte de la atención individual. Independientemente del uso de batas, El personal de atención médica debe continuar usando guantes para el contacto con estos pacientes y su entorno. Se debe continuar enfatizando la higiene de las manos. Los establecimientos también deben intentar colocar a los pacientes colonizados o infectados por un MDRO en habitaciones privadas, si están disponibles. Atención de pacientes con infecciones por : Los establecimientos deben continuar usando precauciones por contacto (ponerse una bata y guantes al ingresar a la habitación del paciente y colocar al paciente en una habitación privada) para la atención de pacientes sintomáticos con CDI. Como parte de una estrategia complementaria para prevenir la transmisión de CDI , algunos establecimientos han implementado precauciones por contacto para la atención de pacientes con alto riesgo de CDI que son portadores asintomáticos de . Hay datos limitados sobre el rol de la portación asintomática en la transmisión de CDI. En estas circunstancias de escasez crítica de batas a nivel nacional, Los establecimientos deben considerar la suspensión de este enfoque hasta que se solucione la situación de escasez. Las batas aún deben usarse como parte de las A un proveedor de atención médica en nuestro establecimiento recientemente le diagnosticaron el COVID-19. ¿Qué tiempo y qué criterios usamos para determinar cuáles pacientes, visitantes y otros miembros del personal de atención médica (HCP) podrían haber estado expuestos mientras esta persona era potencialmente infecciosa? Cualquier persona que haya tenido contacto cercano prolongado (dentro de los 6 pies, durante por lo menos 15 minutos) con el proveedor de atención médica infectado podría haber estado expuesta. Si el proveedor de atención médica tenía síntomas de COVID-19 , se considera que es potencialmente infeccioso comenzando 2 días antes de que los síntomas aparecieron por primera vez y hasta que cumpla con los criterios para discontinuar las precauciones basadas en la transmisión Si el proveedor no tenía síntomas , recolectar información sobre cuándo podría haber estado expuesto podría ayudar a determinar el periodo en que era infeccioso. Si se identifica una exposición. Se debe considerar que el proveedor de atención médica es potencialmente infeccioso comenzando 2 días después de la exposición hasta que se cumplan los criterios para discontinuar las precauciones basadas en la transmisión Si no se puede determinar la fecha de la exposición. A fines del rastreo de contactos, es razonable usar como punto de partida un límite de 2 días antes de que se recolectara la muestra que dio positivo en la prueba del COVID-19, y continuando hasta que se cumplan los criterios para discontinuar las precauciones basadas en la transmisión .</data>

			<data>Aunque por lo general se acepta que el periodo infeccioso es de 10 días después del comienzo de la infección , probablemente no sea eficiente preguntar cuáles fueron los contactos durante los 10 días antes de que se obtuviera la muestra que dio positivo en la prueba de COVID-19. En la mayoría de las situaciones, un proveedor de atención médica expuesto no puede recordar todos los contactos que tuvo en los 10 días previos. Además, debido a que datos recientes parecen indicar que las personas asintomáticas en el momento del diagnóstico podrían tener una carga viral más baja que la de las personas sintomáticas, los recursos adicionales requeridos podrían desviar los recursos para la investigación de casos y el rastreo de contactos de las actividades que tienen más probabilidad de interrumpir la transmisión en curso. El rastreo de contacto se recomienda por lo general para cualquier persona que haya tenido un contacto cercano prolongado con la persona con COVID-19 durante estos periodos. Aunque este tema aborda la exposición a un proveedor de atención médica potencialmente infeccioso, también se recomiendan las siguientes medidas si la persona potencialmente infecciosa es un paciente o visitante. Medidas recomendadas para proveedores de atención médica, pacientes y visitantes: Realizar una evaluación de riesgos e implementar restricciones de trabajo para otros proveedores de atención médica que estuvieron expuestos al proveedor infectado, según si estos proveedores tuvieron un contacto cercano y prolongado qué EPP estaban usando. Hay más información detallada disponible en la Guía interina de los EE. UU. para la evaluación de riesgos y restricciones de trabajo para el personal de atención médica con exposición potencial al COVID-19 precauciones adecuadas basadas en la transmisión a los pacientes expuestos que estén actualmente internados en el establecimiento de atención médica, y vigilarlos por si presentan el COVID-19 hasta 14 días después de su última exposición. Realizar El rastreo de contactos de los pacientes expuestos que no estén actualmente internados en el establecimiento de atención médica y para los visitantes, según se describe en Guía interina para la elaboración de un plan para la investigación de casos y el rastreo de contactos Los establecimientos de atención médica deben tener un proceso para notificar el departamento de salud acerca de casos conocidos o presuntos de COVID-19 y deben establecer un plan, en consulta con las autoridades de salud pública locales, para determinar cómo se investigarán las exposiciones en un establecimiento de atención médica, y cómo se realizará el rastreo de contactos. El plan debe abordar lo siguiente: ¿Quién es responsable de identificar contactos y notificar a las personas potencialmente expuestas? ¿Cómo se harán estas notificaciones? ¿Qué tipos de medidas y seguimiento se recomiendan para las personas expuestas? El rastreo de contactos se debe realizar de tal forma que se proteja la confidencialidad del proveedor de atención médica en la medida que sea posible y conforme a las leyes y regulaciones aplicables. A los proveedores de atención médica y los pacientes que actualmente estén internados en el establecimiento o hayan sido transferidos a otro establecimiento de atención médica, se les debe dar prioridad para la notificación. Estos grupos, si están infectados, tienen el potencial de exponer a una gran cantidad de personas con mayor riesgo de presentar enfermedad grave o, en el caso de pacientes internados, que estén en mayor riesgo de presentar enfermedad grave ellos mismos. La información para los departamentos de salud acerca de la investigación de casos y el rastreo de contactos está disponible en Guía interina para la elaboración de un plan para la investigación de casos y el rastreo de contactos . Esta guía también podría ser útil para los establecimientos de atención médica que lleven a cabo tales actividades. Preguntas frecuentes relativas a la prevención y el control de infecciones asociadas a la atención médica para el COVID-19 Do CDC’s interim infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19 apply to psychiatric hospitals or other behavioral health facilities? Yes.</data>
			<label></label>

			<data>To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC’s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, group activities that may need to continue might need to be adapted to align with recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns. Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care. When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. : Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations. : When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread. For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon. Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available). : While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients.</data>
			<label></label>
		</doc>
		<doc>
			<url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</url>
			<data>Consider not placing ABHS in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP. : As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e. g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients. : One option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat. A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing. Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spacesat the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing. If a long-term care facility has a resident or staff member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, how and to whom should this be communicated? Facilities should follow the reporting requirements of their state or jurisdiction. Those regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (e. g., nursing homes) should also follow all , which are being updated to include new requirements for reporting to CDC and to residents and their representatives. Residents or healthcare personnel (HCP) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, Residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, and ≥ 3 residents or HCP with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other. These could signal an outbreak of COVID-19 or other respiratory disease in the facility. The health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission. the facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and HCP, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified in the facility. Often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur.</data>
			<label></label>
		</doc>
		<doc>
			<url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</url>
			<data>Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. Facilities should make information in nursing homes available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available. Is a negative test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, required before a hospitalized patient can be discharged to a nursing home? . For patients hospitalized with COVID-19, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their and the ability of the accepting facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about . For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, decisions about discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions should be based on and might not be possible due to limitations on availability of testing. If a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 met criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they should be transferred to a facility with the ability to adhere to infection prevention and control recommendations for the care of residents with COVID-19, including placement in a unit or area of the facility designated to care for residents with COVID-19 and provision of recommended personal protective equipment to healthcare personnel. If the patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions but persistent symptoms (e. g., persistent cough), they should ideally be placed in a single room, be restricted to their room to the extent possible, and wear a facemask (if tolerated) during care activities until all symptoms are completely resolved or at baseline. If the patient met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions and persistent symptoms, they do not require additional restrictions. A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses whose COVID-19 status is not known can be transferred to a nursing home without testing. However, to ensure A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses whose COVID-19 status is not known are not infected, nursing homes should place A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses whose COVID-19 status is not known in in a separate observation area or in a single-person room until 14 days have elapsed since admission. As part of , all residents (including those described in the scenarios above) should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) whenever they leave their room. During the COVID-19 pandemic, are there special considerations for surgical and other procedural care settings, including performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)? As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applying . HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities: consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.</data>

			<data>If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19 Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. If shortages exist, N95 or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e. g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e. g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract). As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e. g., smoke evacuation devices). Because COVID-19 can be transmitted asymptomatically, some infected individuals will not be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms. HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having COVID-19 should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use (see FAQ addressing recommended PPE when caring for asymptomatic patients who are not suspected to have COVID-19). HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions. Why does CDC continue to recommend respiratory protection equivalent or higher to the level provided by an N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator for care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19? CDC’s guidance to use NIOSH-approved N95 disposable filtering facepiece or higher level respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 is based on the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory viruses. Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2. Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2. Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics. Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines. CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. Detailed strategies for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators are available on the CDC website.</data>

			<url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</url>
			<data>Once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of N95 and higher level respirators should resume. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19 within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting a patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room? In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e. g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i. e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e. g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene. If the patient is wearing a facemask or cloth face covering, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient’s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19 , use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e. g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask). After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e. g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear . If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is . EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time. Given the potential for asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, what personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by healthcare personnel (HCP) providing care to patients who are not suspected to have COVID-19? The potential for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission underscores the importance of applying prevention practices to all patients, including social distancing, hand hygiene, surface decontamination, and having patients wear a cloth face covering or facemask (for source control) while in a healthcare facility. To protect patients and co-workers, HCP should wear a facemask at all times while they are in a healthcare facility (i. e., practice source control).</data>

			<data>Use of a facemask, instead of a cloth face covering, is recommended for HCP, because a facemask offers both source control and protection from exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others. HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should continue to wear gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), and eye protection (i. e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face). HCP working in facilities located in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are more likely to encounter asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. If COVID-19 is not suspected in a patient presenting for care (based on symptom and exposure history), HCP should follow if required based on the suspected diagnosis). They should also: Wear eye protection in addition to their facemask to ensure the eyes, nose, and mouth are all protected from splashes and sprays of infectious material from others. Wear an N95 or higher-level respirator, instead of a facemask, for: Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings FAQ Surgical procedures that might pose higher risk for transmission if the patient has COVID-19 (e. g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols or involving anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher, such as the nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract) (see Respirators with exhalation valves are not recommended for source control and should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field For HCP working in areas with minimal to no community transmission, the universal eye protection and respirator recommendations (described above) for areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are optional. However, HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions. Universal use of a facemask for source control is recommended for HCP. Depending on testing availability and how rapidly results are available, facilities can also consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure testing for COVID-19. Testing results might inform decisions for universal use of eye protection and respirators as described above, especially if there are PPE shortages. Limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining negative results in patients during their incubation period who later become infectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used. Definitions: Minimal to moderate community transmission: Sustained transmission with high likelihood or confirmed exposure within communal settings and potential for rapid increase in cases No to minimal community transmission: Evidence of isolated cases or limited community transmission, case investigations underway; no evidence of exposure in large communal setting What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by environmental services (EVS) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19? In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene. After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. EVS personnel should delay entry into the room until a for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available ).</data>

			<data>After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask (if not already wearing for source control) and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with COVID-19. Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings? Some procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. Some procedures performed on patients potentially put healthcare personnel and others at an increased risk for pathogen exposure and infection. Development of a comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings has not been possible, due to limitations in available data on which procedures may generate potentially infectious aerosols and the challenges in determining if reported transmissions during AGPs are due to aerosols or other exposures. There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings. Commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered AGPs, or that create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include: Based on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as: *Aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer. It is uncertain whether potential associations between performing this common procedure and increased risk of Infection might be due to aerosols generated by the procedure or due to increased contact between those administering the nebulized medication and infected patients. References related to aerosol generating procedures: Tran K, Cimon K, Severn M, Pessoa-Silva CL, Conly J (2012) Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review. PLoS ONE 7(4); Where should nasopharyngeal swabs be performed on a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, and with what PPE? The collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 can be performed in a regular examination room with the door closed. Use of an airborne infection isolation room for nasopharyngeal specimen collection is not required. HCP in a regular examination room with the door closed should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. If respirators are not readily available, they should be prioritized for other procedures at higher risk for producing infectious aerosols (e. g., intubation), instead of for collecting NP swabs. Do all patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms? Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings recommends placing patients in a regular examination room with the door closed. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for diagnoses such as active tuberculosis.</data>

Caring for patients who have highly resistant Gram-negative organisms (e. g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae) and other MDROs (e. g., ) that are not considered endemic: Rather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of and also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to HCP. Examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. To further preserve gowns, HCP are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters. Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available. Caring for patients with Facilities should continue using Contact Precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patient’s room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with CDI. As part of a supplemental strategy to prevent transmission of CDI , some facilities have implemented Contact Precautions for the care of patients at high risk for CDI who have asymptomatic carriage of . There are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of CDI. In this setting of a critical national shortage of gowns, facilities should consider suspending this approach until the shortage is addressed. Gowns should still be used as part of A healthcare provider at our facility was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. What time period and criteria do our use to determine the patients, visitors, and other healthcare personnel (HCP) who might have been exposed to this individual while he/she was potentially infectious? Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with the infected healthcare provider might have been exposed. If the infected healthcare provider had COVID-19 symptoms, the infected healthcare provider is considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days before symptoms first appeared until the infected healthcare provider meets criteria to discontinue If the infected healthcare provider did not have symptoms , collecting information about when the infected healthcare provider may have been exposed could help inform the period when the infected healthcare provider were infectious. If an exposure is identified . the infected healthcare provider should be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue If the date of exposure cannot be determined . For the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for COVID-19 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue are met. Although the infectious period is generally accepted to be 10 days after onset of infection , eliciting contacts during the entire 10 days before obtaining the specimen that tested positive for COVID-19 is likely inefficient. In most situations an exposed provider cannot recall all contacts over the preceding 10 days.</data>

			<data>Also, because recent data suggest that asymptomatic persons may have a lower viral burden at diagnosis than symptomatic persons, the additional resources required may divert case investigation and contact tracing resources away from activities most likely to interrupt ongoing transmission. Contact tracing is generally recommended for anyone who had prolonged close contact with the person with COVID-19 during these time periods. While this question addresses exposure to a potentially infectious provider, the following actions are also recommended if the potentially infectious individual is a patient or visitor. Recommended actions for HCP, patients, and visitors: Perform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for other HCP who were exposed to the infected provider based on whether these HCP had prolonged, close contact what PPE they were wearing. More detailed information is available in the Interim U. S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19 Place exposed patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility in appropriate and monitor them for onset of COVID-19 until 14 days after their last exposure. Perform contact tracing of exposed patients who are not currently admitted to the healthcare facility and for visitors as described in Health Departments: Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan Healthcare facilities should have a process for notifying the health department about known or suspected cases of COVID-19, and should establish a plan, in consultation with local public health authorities, for how exposures in a healthcare facility will be investigated and how contact tracing will be performed. a plan should address the following: Who is responsible for identifying contacts and notifying potentially exposed individuals? How will such notifications occur? What actions and follow-up are recommended for those who were exposed? Contact tracing should be carried out in a way that protects the confidentiality of HCP to the extent possible and is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. HCP and patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility or were transferred to another healthcare facility should be prioritized for notification. HCP and patients who are currently admitted to the facility or were transferred to another healthcare facility, if infected, have the potential to expose a large number of individuals at higher risk for severe disease, or in the situation of admitted patients, be at higher risk for severe illness themselves. Information for health departments about case investigation and contact tracing is available in the Health Departments:  Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan .

How can I lower the chance that I will get COVID-19? The best way to prevent illness is to take steps to avoid being exposed to this virus. Start by ensuring you and others around you use (such as washing hands often, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and covering your cough). Read to learn more. If there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to your facility, you will be asked daily about symptoms over the last 24 hours and any contact you had with someone infected with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Your temperature will also be checked daily. Do I have a greater chance of getting COVID-19? Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside your facility. this virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has this virus on this virus and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way this virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness.</data>

Anyone who has had flu-like symptoms in the last 24 hours or has been in contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 in last 14 days should not visit a correctional or detention facility. All visitors will be screened for symptoms and contact with someone with COVID-19. Staff will also perform temperature checks on All visitors. Visitors should contact the facility about their rules on visits before they travel. If a person in the facility has COVID-19, visitors may not be allowed to enter the facility. Instead, non-contact visits can be used, when possible. Do people who are incarcerated (in prison, jail, or detention facilities) have a greater chance of getting COVID-19 than others? Incarcerated and detained people spend almost all of their time within congregate environments where groups of people share the same space, which increases the chance for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into someone’s lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has this virus on this virus and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes; however, this is not the most likely way this virus spreads. COVID-19 may also be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Learn more about how What does it mean if someone I know is in quarantine? Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to be put into quarantine for 14 days. This means that they will be placed in a room separate from others, until staff are sure that they don’t have symptoms. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, and/or the person in quarantine tests positive for COVID-19, they should be placed under medical isolation and evaluated. If symptoms do not develop and they do not test positive for COVID-19, quarantine restrictions can be lifted, or removed, after the 14-day period ends.</data>

Some facilities may arrange for non-contact visits when possible, and staff may screen and perform temperature checks on all visitors. You should also . Wearing cloth face coverings may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues and is not recommended for children under 2 years or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance. If a family member or friend is returning home soon (during the COVID-19 pandemic) from a correctional or detention facility, how should a household prepare to receive them and maintain everyone’s safety? Depending on the steps facilities are taking and the length of stay, people released from a facility may have had screenings for COVID-19 symptoms, temperature checks, or even a test—a pre-release planning process. a family member or friend may have also been offered information and resources on how to . If a family member or friend were sick at the time of release, a family member or friend may have been linked to community resources to make sure a family member or friend follow proper medical isolation and have access to medical care.

Actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces ; and washing hands often with soap and water. How can my retirement community or independent living facility prepare for COVID-19? Administrators should take the following actions to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in their community or facility Cancel public or group activities and events Inform workers and volunteers to avoid close contact with residents When possible, limit visitors and volunteers to essential persons Advise residents to stay home and avoid public places Alter schedules to reduce mixing (e. g., stagger meal, activity, arrival/departure times) Support residents in preparing Establish the ‘buddy’ system to ensure residents stay connected. Encourage residents to have extra medications and supplies. Identify residents with unique needs and work with them to tailor these strategies. Find ways to support residents in Inform residents using print materials and high-visibility posters Encourage everyone to take to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Ensure hand hygiene supplies (e. g., hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol) are readily available in all buildings. Monitor for cases and take action when someone is sick. Screen workers and when possible volunteers Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your facility among staff, so you can identify if the rate of absenteeism increases. Implement flexible sick-leave policies and actively encourage sick employees to stay home Coordinate with local health facilities if you suspect a resident or staff member may have COVID-19 What resources does CDC have available to share with facilities? Share resources with the community to help them understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to protect themselves: CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include Does CDC have recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting surfaces? Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e. g., doorknobs, light switches, countertops) with cleaners that you typically use. Use all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. Practice strict infection control procedures if there is a case in your facility. Follow CDC’s Cleaning and Disinfection Recommendations for Communities. What should administrators do if a resident or staff shows symptoms of COVID-19? Ask residents to actively monitor (at least daily) for , including fever and respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, new or change in cough). Administrators should work with local health authorities to establish procedures for those who become sick. Sick residents should avoid contact with individuals who are healthy.</data>

			<data>If you think someone may have COVID-19, ask them to self-isolate and you should contact local health officials. What should administrators do if there is a case of COVID-19 in our facility? Work with local health authorities to communicate the possible exposure to residents, staff, and visitors. Clean and disinfect all shared facilities and high-touch surfaces. Limit visitors to essential staff  and visitors. Staff and, when possible, visitors should be screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 before entering the facility. Residents will need to actively monitor their health for COVID-19 symptoms. Cancel group activities. Residences that become ill should be advised to call the medical facility in advance of their visit. See CDC’s full interim guidance for more details. What actions should I take to plan for an outbreak? Creating an emergency plan for mass gatherings and large community events, such as concerts and sporting events, can help protect the health of your staff, attendees, and the local community. This planning should include: Encouraging staff and attendees to stay home if sick. Developing flexible refund policies for attendees. Providing supplies for attendees and staff that can be used to help prevent the spread of germs. Consulting local public health officials about your event. How many guests can safely attend a conference, sporting event, concert, or other community event? CDC does not have a limit or recommend a specific number of attendees for these types of events and instead encourages event organizers to focus on ways to limit people’s contact with each other. Each event organizer will need to determine the appropriate number for their setting in collaboration with local health officials. Each event organizer should also check state, county, and city rules regarding any current restrictions limiting the number of attendees at events.</data>

			<data>In general, the number that is chosen should allow individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other. Rather than focusing on an ideal number, event organizers and administrators should focus on the ability to reduce and limit contact between attendees, staff, and others. In general, the , the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor spaces because indoors, it can be harder to keep people at least 6 feet apart and the ventilation is not as good as it is outdoors. Does CDC have recommendations on how to maintain 6 feet between attendees during events? Yes. CDC recommends several strategies for this. For instance, organizers can: Limit attendance or seating capacity to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms. Block off rows or sections of seating in order to space people at least 6 feet apart. Use multiple entrances and exits and discourage crowded waiting areas. Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks. Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (such as guides for creating one-way routes). Prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained as much as possible. Offer online attendance options in addition to in-person attendance to help reduce the number of attendees. Consider limiting the number of people who occupy the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. Do not allow lines or crowds to form near the restroom. Take steps to ensure that individuals can stay at least 6 feet apart from each other. Should organizers test all attendees and staff for COVID-19 before they can enter an event? recommend testing all attendees and staff before allowing them to enter. Testing all event attendees and staff for COVID-19 before allowing organizers to enter the venue has not been systematically studied.</data>

			<data>It is unknown if entry testing at event venues provides any additional reduction in person-to-person transmission of the virus beyond what would be expected with other preventive measures (such as social distancing, wearing cloth face coverings, hand washing, enhanced cleaning and disinfection). CDC does recommend conducting health checks such as temperature screening and/or symptom checking of staff and attendees safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Does CDC recommend all event attendees wear cloth face coverings? Yes. CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. CDC recommends that organizers require staff to wear and encourage attendees ahead of events to bring and wear cloth face coverings at an event. Cloth face coverings are most essential when physical distancing is difficult (such as when moving within a crowd or audience). Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have . Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. Cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment. Cloth face coverings are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voices (such as shouting, chanting, singing). Provide all staff with information on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings . Advise staff that cloth face coverings should not be placed on: Babies or children younger than 2 years old Anyone who has trouble breathing Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance What actions can staff and attendees take to prevent the spread of COVID-19? Encourage staff and attendees to take to help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19. This includes: Cleaning your hands often. with people who are sick. Staying home when you are sick. Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.

What are things to consider when determining if an event needs to be postponed or canceled? Consult with local public health officials and continually assess, based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees (if possible) at an event or gathering. When determining if you should postpone or cancel a large gathering or event, consider the: Overall number of attendees or crowd size. Number of attendees who are at higher risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19. This includes older adults and people with underlying health problems such as lung or heart disease and diabetes. How close together attendees will be at an event. Amount of spread in local community and the communities from where your attendees are likely to travel. Needs and capacity of the local community to host or participate in an event.

			<data>See Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection Recommendations Are pregnant women more susceptible to infection, or at increased risk for severe illness, morbidity, or mortality with COVID-19, compared with the general public? We do not have information from published scientific reports about susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19. Pregnant women also might be at risk for severe illness, morbidity, or mortality compared to the general population as observed in cases of other related coronavirus infections [including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)* and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, during pregnancy. Pregnant women should engage in usual to avoid infection like washing hands often and avoiding people who are sick. Are pregnant women with COVID-19 at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes? We do not have information on adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth, has been observed in cases of infection with other related coronaviruses [SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] during pregnancy. High fevers during the first trimester of pregnancy can increase the risk of certain birth defects. Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19? guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e. g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability. Can pregnant women with COVID-19 pass the virus to their fetus or newborn (i. e. vertical transmission)? Vertical transmission includes transmission of a pathogen from a mother to her fetus or newborn before, during, or immediately after delivery. Transplacental transmission occurs during pregnancy when maternal viremia leads to transmission across the placenta (e. g., Zika virus). Perinatal transmission at the time of delivery can occur when the newborn comes into exposure with maternal bodily fluids during delivery (e. g., as occurs with herpes simplex virus [HSV]), through transmission of infectious virus through the breastmilk (e. g., as occurs with HIV), or other bodily fluids (e. g., as occurs with group B and vaginal fluids,  influenza viruses and respiratory droplets), and some pathogens are transmitted by multiple routes. A small number of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 have reportedly tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 shortly after birth.</data>

			<data>However, it is not clear if these infants were exposed before or after birth. Additionally, virus was not detected in samples of amniotic fluid. Limited information is available about vertical transmission for other coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) but vertical transmission has not been reported for these infections. Are infants born to mothers with COVID-19 during pregnancy at increased risk for adverse outcomes? Based on limited case reports, adverse infant outcomes (e. g., preterm birth) have been reported among infants born to mothers positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. However, it is not clear that adverse infant outcomes (e. g., preterm birth) were related to maternal infection, and at this time the risk of adverse infant outcomes is not known. Given the limited data available related to COVID-19 during pregnancy, knowledge of adverse outcomes from other respiratory viral infections may provide some information. For example, other respiratory viral infections during pregnancy, such as influenza, have been associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm birth. Additionally, having a cold or influenza with high fever early in pregnancy may increase the risk of certain birth defects. Infants born preterm and/or small for gestational age have been reported among infants born to mothers with other coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, during pregnancy. Is there a risk that COVID-19 in a pregnant woman or neonate could have long-term effects on infant health and development that may require clinical support beyond infancy? At this time, there is no information on long-term health effects on infants either with COVID-19, or those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in utero. In general, prematurity and low birth weight are associated with adverse long-term health effects. Is maternal illness with COVID-19 during lactation associated with potential risk to a breastfeeding infant? Current knowledge suggests that human-to-human transmission occurs by close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 mainly via respiratory droplets produced when a person with infection coughs, sneezes, or talks. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. In limited case series reported to date, no evidence of virus has been found in the breast milk of women with COVID-19. No information is available on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2* through breast milk (i. e., infectious virus in the breast milk). In limited reports of lactating women infected with SARS-CoV,* virus has not been detected in breast milk; however, antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected in at least one sample. SARS-CoV caused an outbreak in 2002-200SARS-CoV-2.</data>

			<data>As the name indicates, the viruses are related, however they are not the same. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through drinking water?COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivateCOVID-19. Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool)?COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, Scientists think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through pools, hot tubs, spas, and water play areas? There is no evidence thatCOVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas. Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water. While there is of COVID-19 ofCOVID-19, it is important for individuals as well as owners and operators of these facilities to take steps to ensure health and safety: Everyone should follow local and state guidance that may determine when and how recreational water facilities may operate. Individuals should continue to at recreational water venues both in and out of the water – for example, by practicing social distancing and good hand hygiene. In addition to ensuring water safety and quality, owners and operators of community pools, hot tubs, spas, and water play areas should follow the interim guidance for businesses and employers for cleaning and disinfecting their community facilities. Can the virus spread through sewerage systems?COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. Researchers do not know whether * virus can cause disease if a person is exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems. There is no evidence to date that this has occurred. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low. Researchers have analyzed the available information which suggest that standard municipal and wastewater treatment practices should inactivateCOVID-19. CDC is reviewing information on COVID-19 transmission as CDC becomes available.</data>

			<data>Guidance will be updated as new evidence is assessed. Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves fromCOVID-19? Recently,COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from * virus. Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment ( ) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities. If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands? In most cases, it is safe to with soap and tap water during a . Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. What should I consider as I plan and prepare for COVID-19? As you plan and prepare, you should reinforce healthy practices to everyone on campus and prepare for a potential case of COVID-19, regardless of the level of community transmission. As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and action for your college or university. Together, you will need to consider your local community situation—whether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial). CDC has created guidance for the scenarios listed below, to help colleges, universities and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within their campus, and to react quickly should a case be identified. the guidance from your local public health officials includes information about the following: How to prepare if you have no community spread of COVID-19. How to prepare if you have minimal to moderate community spread in your community. How to prepare if you have substantial community spread in your community.

			<data>See CDC’s full interim guidance for more details What groups should I work with in your community to prepare? Work with your local health department to develop/update your emergency operations plan and information-sharing system. Institutional information systems can be used to get accurate and up-to-date information, and day-to-day absenteeism or changes in student health center traffic can help detect and respond to an outbreak. What should I include in my emergency operations plan? Review and update your emergency operations plan in collaboration with your local health departmentexternal icon. Focus on the components or annexes of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Ensure my emergency operations plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases (e. g., seasonal influenza). This includes strategies for social distancing and school dismissal that may be used to stop or slow the spread of infectious disease. my emergency operations plan should also include strategies for continuing education, meal programs, and other related services in the event of school dismissal. Ensure my emergency operations plan emphasizes everyday preventive actions for students and staff. For example, emphasize actions such as staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often. How can our campus health clinic prepare for COVID-19? for recommended steps healthcare facilities can take now to prepare for COVID-19. What can staff and students do to prevent the spread of COVID-19? Encourage students and staff to take to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, such as staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. What resources does CDC have available to share with staff, students, and parents? Share resources with the school community to help students, and parents understand COVID-19 and steps students, and parents can take to protect students, and parents: CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include and information on proper handwashing technique.

			<data>Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your community’s situation. Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies: Cancel or modify courses where students are likely to be in very close contact. Increase space between desks. Reduce congestion in the health clinic. Consider if and how existing dining services should be scaled back or adapted. What should I do if there is substantial community transmission? If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for their college or university. Similar strategies will extend across organizations (e. g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) in a collective effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Measures will likely include extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e. g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. What should we do if a student, staff or faculty member shows symptoms of COVID-19? You should establish procedures for anyone who becomes sick or arrives sick on campus. Sick students, staff and faculty should be separated from others, given a mask to wear, if available and sent to their place or residence as soon as possible. Sick residents of on-campus housing should avoid contact with individuals who are healthy. What should we do if we have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on campus or identify someone who was on campus? Immediately notify local health officials. local health officials will help administrators determine a course of action for your college or university. Administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed.</data>

Colleges and universities are not expected to make decisions about dismissals on their own. You may need to temporarily dismiss school for 2-5 days, if someone with COVID-19 was on campus. COVID-19. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. If there is substantial transmission in the local community, local health officials may suggest extended school dismissals. This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. How long should colleges or universities be dismissed? It depends on the situation at your school and community. You may need to temporarily dismiss school for 2-5 days, if someone with COVID-19 was on campus. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. The need for an extended dismissal will be made based on what officials discover from contact tracing. If there is substantial transmission in the local community, local health officials may suggest extended school dismissals.

			<data>Yes, consider ways that your college/university can adapt or use alternative teaching methods. Review continuity plans, including plans for the continuity of teaching, learning, and research. Implement e-learning plans and distance learning options as feasible and appropriate. Ensure continuity plans address how to temporarily postpone, limit, or adapt research-related activities (e. g., study recruitment or participation, access to labs) in a manner that protects the safety of researchers, participants, facilities, and equipment. Use of existing infrastructure and services (e. g., Blackboard, Skype, Zoom) to support efficient transition of classes from in-person to distance-based formats. This may include using strategies such as faculty check-ins, recorded class meetings or lectures, and live class meetings. Other student support services such as online library services, print materials available online, phone- or Internet-based counseling support, or study groups enabled through digital media. Institutes of higher education should determine, in consultation with their university system: How to convert face-to-face lessons into online lessons and how to train faculty to do so. How to triage technical issues if faced with limited IT support and staff How to deal with the potential lack of students’ access to computers and the Internet at home or in temporary housing. Should we temporarily cancel extracurricular group activities and large events? If your community has cases of COVID-19, work with your local public health officials to determine if you should . If you decide to dismiss classes, you should also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events, such as club meetings, performances, social events, athletic team practices, and sporting events. You should also discourage students, staff, and faculty from gathering or socializing elsewhere. If classes are dismissed, how should we decide when to re-open -campus? Schools should work with local health officials to assess when students, staff and faculty can return to campus. What should we do if a student or staff member recently traveled to an area with COVID-19 or has a family member who has traveled to an area with COVID-19? , and consult with state and local health officials. Health officials may use CDC’s Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings to make recommendations.

			<data>Administrators should always reinforce healthy practices among their staff and students, as well as prepare for a potential case of COVID-19, regardless of the current level of community transmission. As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and actions for your school or program. Together, you will need to consider your local community situation—whether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial). CDC has created overall guidance, as well as guidance tailored for transmission level in your area to help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent COVID-19 and react quickly when a case is identified. The guidance includes information about the following: How to prepare if you have no community spread of COVID-19. How to prepare if you have minimal to moderate community spread in your community. How to prepare if you have substantial community spread in your community. What to do if a person with COVID-19 has entered your school. See CDC’s full interim guidance for more details. What can staff and students do to prevent the spread of COVID-19? Encourage students and staff to take to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. These actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. How should my school prepare when there is no community transmission in our area? The most important thing you can do now is to prepare. Schools need to be ready if COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies: Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans. Develop information-sharing systems with partners.</data>

			<data>Cancel or modify classes where students are likely to be in very close contact. Increase the space between desks to at least 6 feet. Reduce congestion in the health office. Limit bringing in students from other schools for special programs (e. g., music, robotics, academic clubs) Teach staff, students, and their families to maintain a safe distance (6 feet) from each other in my school. What should I do when there is substantial community transmission? If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community. You may need to consider extended school dismissals (e. g. dismissals for longer than 2 weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e. g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e. g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. What resources does CDC have available to share with staff, students, and parents? Share resources with the school community to help students, and parents understand COVID-19 and steps students, and parents can take to protect students, and parents: CDC offers several free handwashing resources that include , and tips for families to help children develop good handwashing habits. Other health and education professional organizations may also have helpful resources your school can use or share, such as the helping children cope with emergencies Stigma prevention and facts about COVID-19 What should I do if my school experiences increased rates of absenteeism? If your school notices a substantial increase in the number of students or staff missing school due to illness, report this to your local health officials. What steps should your school take if a student or staff member shows symptoms of COVID-19? You should establish procedures to ensure students and staff who become sick at school or who arrive at school sick are sent home as soon as possible. Keep anyone sick separate from well students and staff until the sick person can be sent home What should I do if the suspected sick student or staff member is confirmed to have COVID-19? Immediately notify local health officials. local health officials will help administrators determine a course of action for local health officials child care programs or schools.</data>

			<data>You will likely dismiss students and most staff for 2-5 days. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting your school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. If children with asthma use “breathing treatments” or peak flow meters, do schools need to be concerned about aerosolizing the virus that causes COVID-19? First, students with symptoms of COVID-19 should not attend school. Symptoms of asthma and COVID-19 may overlap, including cough and shortness of breath. Therefore, students experiencing acute asthma attacks should not be attending school without approval by a healthcare provider; if an asthma attack starts at school, a student may need a bronchodilator treatment before being sent home or before an ambulance arrives. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilators recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces and nebulizers with disposable tubing with mask/mouthpieces. Inhalers and nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. During this COVID-19 pandemic, asthma treatments using inhalers with spacers (with or without face mask,  according to each student’s individualized treatment plan) are preferred over nebulizer treatments whenever possible. Based on limited data, use of asthma inhalers (with or without spacers or face masks) is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure. Due to limited availability of data, use of asthma inhalers (with or without spacers or face masks) is uncertain whether aerosols generated by nebulizer treatments are potentially infectious During this COVID-19 pandemic, nebulizer treatments at school should be reserved for children who cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler (with or without spacer or face mask). Use of peak flow meters, including in the school setting, includes forceful exhalation. Based on limited available data , forceful exhalation is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure associated with increased risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. However, for some people with asthma, using a peak flow meter can trigger cough. Schools should obtain the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff who administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters to students with asthma. PPE for use when administering nebulizer treatments or peak flow meters to students with asthma consists of gloves, medical or surgical and eye protection. School staff should be trained on when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, where this PPE is stored, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of used PPE. CDC has on using PPE. Staff should also be trained on how to administer nebulizer treatments and peak flow meters.</data>

			<data>During this COVID-19 pandemic, if a nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter is necessary at school for a student, the number of people present in the room should be limited to the student and the staff member administering the treatment or peak flow meter. If appropriate based on the student’s age and level of maturity, the staff member could leave the room and return when the nebulizer treatment is finished. After the nebulizer treatment or use of peak flow meter, the room should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. CDC has information on how to clean and disinfect how to prevent asthma attacks triggered by cleaning and disinfecting People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19. CDC has more information on COVID-19 for Reference related to aerosol generating procedures: Tran K, Cimon K, Severn M, Pessoa-Silva CL, Conly J (2012) Aerosol Generating Procedures and Risk of Transmission of Acute Respiratory Infections to Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review. PLoS ONE 7(4); If each child has his or her own spacer, can a school’s metered dose inhaler be used by more than one student if the actuator is cleaned before use by another student? CDC is not aware of data regarding practices to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses, when multiple people share one asthma inhaler. Students should be permitted to use one asthma inhaler, as needed, to the extent permitted by state law and school policies. When students need to use of one asthma inhaler, one asthma inhaler should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilators recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces. Additional strategies to further minimize cross-contamination include using spacers with one-way valves and not allowing the student to touch one asthma inhaler, the student can touch the spacer, but only the school staff administering the inhaler can touch the inhaler). Limited data from healthcare settings suggest wiping all surfaces of an inhaler with an alcohol-based wipe containing at least 70% alcohol after inhaler use, and then allowing these surfaces to air-dry can prevent bacterial cross-contamination. CDC is not aware of data on whether this has helped prevent viral infections or infections in the school setting. CDC is not aware of data regarding viral contamination of spacer devices. A study evaluating the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) on plastic, stainless steel, and cardboard surfaces showed that CDC is able to remain viable for up to 72 hours. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilators recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers or disposable mouthpieces. School staff who administer asthma medication to students should use good hand hygiene, including with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after administration. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, staff should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.</data>

			<data>CDC has more information on COVID-19 for (including school nurses). CDC has additional information about asthma (non-COVID related) for health professionals and schools here: If a school is considering limiting students to the local geographic area due to a phased opening, would children displaced due to homelessness be prohibited from attending their home school? , students experiencing homelessness should receive equal access to free, appropriate public education as provided to other students. Per the Act, residency requirements should not be a barrier to the enrollment, attendance, or success in school for children and youths experiencing homelessness. When should I dismiss our school/child care program? Any decision about school dismissal or cancellation of school events should be made in coordination with your local health officials. Schools are not expected to make decisions about dismissals on their own. You may need to temporarily dismiss school for 2-5 days, if a student or staff member attended school before being confirmed as having COVID-19. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. If there is substantial transmission in the local community, local health officials may suggest extended school dismissals (e. g., dismissals for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. Are there ways for students to keep learning if we decide to dismiss schools? Yes, consider implementing e-learning plans, including digital and distance learning options as feasible and appropriate. Determine, in consultation with school district officials or other relevant state or local partners: If a waiver is needed for state requirements of a minimum number of in-person instructional hours or school days (seat time) as a condition for funding. How to convert face-to-face lessons into online lessons and how to train teachers to do so. How to triage technical issues if faced with limited IT support and staff. How to encourage appropriate adult supervision while children are using distance learning approaches. How to deal with the potential lack of students’ access to computers and the internet at home.

			<data>In the event of a school dismissal, extracurricular group activities and large events, such as performances, field trips, and sporting events should also be cancelled. This may require close coordination with other partners and organizations (e. g., high school athletics associations, music associations). In addition, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall. Ensure continuity of meal programs for your students. Consider ways to distribute food to students who receive free or reduced cost meals. Check with the US Department of Agriculture – Food and Nutrition Service for additional information: If there is community spread of COVID-19, design strategies to avoid distribution in settings where people might gather in a group or crowd. Consider options such as “grab-and-go” bagged lunches or meal delivery. Consider alternatives for providing essential medical and social services for students. Continue providing necessary services for children with special healthcare needs, or work with the state Title V Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) Program. If we dismiss school, what do we need to consider when re-opening the building to students? CDC is currently working on additional guidance to help schools determine when and how to re-open in an orderly manner. If you need immediate assistance with this, consult local health officials for guidance. Stay in touch with your local and state health department, as well as the Department of Education. What should we do if a child, student, or staff member has recently traveled to an area with COVID-19 or has a family member who has traveled to an area with COVID-19? , and consult with state and local health officials.

			<data>What can teachers do to protect themselves and their students? Teachers and students are in close contact for much of the day, and schools can become a place where respiratory diseases like COVID-19 can quickly spread. Protect yourself and your students by practicing and during the school year. You should also plan to say home if you have symptoms of COVID-19 like fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Encourage parents to keep students at home if they’re sick. Consider social distancing strategies, such as modifying classes where students are likely to be in very close contact; increasing space between desks; and allowing students to eat meals in the classroom. How should I talk to my students about COVID-19? As public conversations around COVID-19 increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19. Teachers can play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear. CDC has created guidance to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease. What are schools doing to prepare for COVID-19? Schools are advised to ensure adequate supplies are available to support healthy hygiene practices, and to routinely clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that are frequently touched. Schools are also working closely with local health officials to review and update Schools school emergency operation plans, and to determine if or when to dismiss schools. How will I know if my child&apos;s school is closed? Look out for information from your school district. Information may come via phone, email, or website depending on your school’s communication plan.

			<data>Person-to-person spread from or to children, as among adults, is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. Despite lower risk of serious illness, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with older adults and people of any age who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 How should parents talk to children about COVID-19? As public conversations around COVID-19 increase, children may worry about themselves, their family, and friends getting ill with COVID-19. Parents play an important role in helping children make sense of what they hear in a way that is honest, accurate, and minimizes anxiety or fear. CDC has created guidance to help adults have conversations with children about COVID-19 and ways they can avoid getting and spreading the disease. Are there work restrictions recommended for HCP with underlying health conditions who may care for COVID-19 patients? What about for pregnant HCP? Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die. People of any age with are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19. What should HCP do outside of work to prevent spread of COVID-19 transmission? CDC’s guidance on Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure . HCP may choose to implement extra measures when arriving home from providing healthcare, such as removing any clothing worn during delivery of healthcare, taking off shoes, washing clothing, and immediately showering. However, these are optional personal practices because there is insufficient evidence on whether they are effective. Person-to-person transmission is currently thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads.

People with moderate to severe asthma might be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. Based on what we currently know about COVID-19, the selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma has not been affected. are available. Continuation of inhaled corticosteroids is particularly important for patients already using these medications because there is no evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity with use of inhaled corticosteroids and an abundance of data showing reduced risk of asthma exacerbation with maintenance of asthma controller therapy. Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer treatments. Are patients with hypertension at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19? Hypertension is common in the United States. Hypertension is more frequent with advancing age and among men, non-Hispanic blacks, and people with other underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and serious heart disease. Based on what we know at this time, people with pulmonary hypertension are at increased risk for severe illness.

			<data>If my patient has an underlying medical condition, what is my patient’s risk of acquiring or having severe illness from COVID-19, and what should I tell my patient? There is insufficient information on COVID-19 to determine the level of risk for each underlying medical condition. CDC is analyzing data continuously and provides updates as soon as new information is available. You know your patient’s overall health and how well their conditions are managed. Use your clinical judgement to evaluate on a case by case basis. Patients frequently in congregate settings are at increased risk of infection. Patients with may be at increased risk of severe disease. If possible, work with patients to manage their underlying condition to the best of their ability, including ensuring that patients have sufficient medication and supplies. Prescribing three-month supplies of medications may help ensure access to sufficient medications. Explain to all patients which symptoms of their chronic conditions require emergency care or in-person visits. Stress the importance of obtaining emergency care if needed. Reassure your patients who require emergency care that emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect them from acquiring COVID-19 that increase their risk of severe illness or poorer outcomes from COVID-19: To stay home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed. Closely follow emergency departments care plans for management of emergency departments chronic disease, including, for example, achieving better glycemic or blood pressure control.

Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19. Facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e. g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability. What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and who is at risk? CDC is investigating reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19. Patients with MIS-C have presented with a persistent fever and a variety of signs and symptoms including multiorgan (e. g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic) involvement and elevated inflammatory markers. CDC is collaborating with domestic and international partners to better understand this new syndrome, including how common CDC is and CDC risk factors, and to begin tracking cases. For more information, including a full case definition, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers Do CDC’s interim infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19 apply to psychiatric hospitals or other behavioral health facilities? Yes. To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC’s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, group activities that may need to continue might need to be adapted to align with recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns. Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care. When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. : Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations.</data>

			<data>: When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread. For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon. Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available). : While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients. Consider not placing ABHS in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP. : As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e. g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients. : One option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat. A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing. Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spaces at the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing.</data>

			<data>If a long-term care facility has a resident or staff member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, how and to whom should this be communicated? Facilities should follow the reporting requirements of their state or jurisdiction. Those regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (e. g., nursing homes) should also follow all , which are being updated to include new requirements for reporting to CDC and to residents and their representatives. In addition, Residents or healthcare personnel (HCP) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, Residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, and ≥ 3 residents or HCP with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other. These could signal an outbreak of COVID-19 or other respiratory disease in the facility. The health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission. the facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and HCP, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified in the facility. Often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur. Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. Facilities should make information in nursing homes available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available. Is a negative test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, required before a hospitalized patient can be discharged to a nursing home? No. For patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their clinical status and the ability of an accepting facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about . For patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, decisions about discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions should be based on the strategies outlined . The test-based strategy is recommended only for use in limited circumstances. If a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection met criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they should be transferred to a facility with the ability to adhere to infection prevention and control recommendations for the care of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including placement in a unit or area of the facility designated to care for residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection and provision of recommended personal protective equipment to healthcare personnel.</data>

			<data>If the patient met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they do not require additional restrictions. A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses who is not known to have SARS-CoV-2 infection can be transferred to a nursing home without testing. To ensure a patient was not exposed and might subsequently develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, nursing homes should place A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses who is not known to have in in a separate observation area or in a single-person room for 14 days after admission. As part of , all residents (including those described in the scenarios above) should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) whenever they leave their room. During the COVID-19 pandemic, are there special considerations for surgical and other procedural care settings, including performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)? As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applying . HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities: consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility. If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19 Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. If shortages exist, N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e. g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e. g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract). As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e. g., smoke evacuation devices). Because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by individuals who are infected but do not have symptoms, some infected individuals will not be identified by screening for clinical signs and symptoms. HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use . HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions. In addition to the use of universal PPE and source control in healthcare settings, targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 might be used to identify those with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and further reduce risk for exposures in some healthcare settings. Depending on guidance from local and state health departments, testing availability, and how rapidly results are available, facilities can consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure diagnostic testing with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays for SARS-CoV-2. Testing results might inform decisions about rescheduling elective procedures or about the need for additional Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for the patient. Limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining negative results in patients during their incubation period who later become infectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used.</data>

			<data>Why does CDC continue to recommend respiratory protection equivalent or higher to the level provided by an N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator for care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19? CDC’s guidance to use NIOSH-approved N95 disposable filtering facepiece or higher level respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 is based on the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory viruses. Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2. Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2. Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics. Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines. CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. Detailed strategies for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators are available on the CDC website. Once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of N95 and higher level respirators should resume. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting the patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room? In general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering (if tolerated) to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e. g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i. e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]).</data>

			<data>Gowns should still be used as part of A healthcare provider at our facility was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. What time period and criteria do our use to determine the patients, visitors, and other healthcare personnel (HCP) who might have been exposed to this individual while he/she was potentially infectious? Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with the infected healthcare provider might have been exposed. If the infected healthcare provider had COVID-19 symptoms, the infected healthcare provider is considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days before symptoms first appeared until the infected healthcare provider meets criteria to discontinue If the infected healthcare provider did not have symptoms , collecting information about when the infected healthcare provider may have been exposed could help inform the period when the infected healthcare provider were infectious. If an exposure is identified . the infected healthcare provider should be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue If the date of exposure cannot be determined . For the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for COVID-19 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue are met. Although the infectious period is generally accepted to be 10 days after onset of infection , eliciting contacts during the entire 10 days before obtaining the specimen that tested positive for COVID-19 is likely inefficient. In most situations an exposed provider cannot recall all contacts over the preceding 10 days. Also, because recent data suggest that asymptomatic persons may have a lower viral burden at diagnosis than symptomatic persons, the additional resources required may divert case investigation and contact tracing resources away from activities most likely to interrupt ongoing transmission. Contact tracing is generally recommended for anyone who had prolonged close contact with the person with COVID-19 during these time periods. While this question addresses exposure to a potentially infectious provider, the following actions are also recommended if the potentially infectious individual is a patient or visitor. Recommended actions for HCP, patients, and visitors: Perform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for other HCP who were exposed to the infected provider based on whether these HCP had prolonged, close contact what PPE they were wearing. More detailed information is available in the Interim U. S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19 Place exposed patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility in appropriate and monitor them for onset of COVID-19 until 14 days after their last exposure. Perform contact tracing of exposed patients who are not currently admitted to the healthcare facility and for visitors as described in Health Departments: Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan Healthcare facilities should have a process for notifying the health department about known or suspected cases of COVID-19, and should establish a plan, in consultation with local public health authorities, for how exposures in a healthcare facility will be investigated and how contact tracing will be performed. a plan should address the following: Who is responsible for identifying contacts and notifying potentially exposed individuals? How will such notifications occur? What actions and follow-up are recommended for those who were exposed? Contact tracing should be carried out in a way that protects the confidentiality of affected individuals to the extent possible and is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. HCP and patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility or were transferred to another healthcare facility should be prioritized for notification.</data>

			<data>HCP and patients who are currently admitted to the facility or were transferred to another healthcare facility, if infected, have the potential to expose a large number of individuals at higher risk for severe disease, or in the situation of admitted patients, be at higher risk for severe illness themselves. Information for health departments about case investigation and contact tracing is available in the Health Departments:  Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan . Information for health departments about case investigation and contact tracing is available in the Health Departments:  Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan could also be helpful to healthcare facilities performing such activities. A healthcare provider in our facility worked while infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, A healthcare provider in our facility wore a facemask at all times while interacting with patients. Are the patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 and should SARS-CoV-2 be notified? Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) should be considered potentially exposed. The use of a for source control and adherence to other recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) measures (e. g., hand hygiene) by the provider help to reduce the risk of transmission or severe illness. In areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, patients are already at risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to exposures outside their home and should be alert to the development of signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The following should be considered when determining which patients are at higher risk for transmission and might be prioritized for evaluation and testing: use by the patient – Mirroring the risk assessment guidance for healthcare personnel , patients not wearing a facemask would likely be at higher risk for infection compared to those that were wearing a facemask. Type of interaction that occurred between the patient and infected provider – An interaction involving manipulation or prolonged close contact with the patient’s eyes, nose, or mouth (e. g., dental cleaning) likely poses higher risk of transmission to the patient compared to other interactions (e. g., blood pressure check). PPE used by infected HCP – HCP wearing a (or respirator) and face shield that extends down below the chin might have had better source control than wearing only a facemask. Note that respirators with exhalation valves might not provide source control. Current status of patient - Is the patient currently admitted to a hospital or long-term care facility? These individuals, if infected, can be at higher risk for severe illness and have the potential to expose large numbers of individuals at risk for severe disease. When is someone infectious? The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known with certainty.</data>

			<data>Based on current evidence, scientists believe that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 may shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 for up to following symptom onset, while a small fraction of persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons, may shed replication-competent virus for up to . It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e. g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days. Which body fluids can spread infection? SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several weeks or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. MERS-CoV is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including blood, vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2. Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2? The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients infected with other betacoronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43), the genus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, are unlikely to be re-infected shortly (e. g., 3 months or more) after they recover. However, more information is needed to know whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19. How do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2? Clinicians are able to access laboratory testing through state and local public health laboratories, as well as commercial and clinical laboratories across the country. The Association of Public Health Laboratories provides a list of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 viral tests. For more information, see Clinicians should direct testing questions to their . Commercial reference laboratories are also able to offer a larger volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.</data>

			<data>for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians. Healthcare providers should report positive  results to their local/state health department CDC does not directly collect these data directly. See recommendations for prioritization of testing, and instructions for specimen collection at Do existing commercially available multiple respiratory virus panels detect SARS-CoV-2? Yes. There are commercially developed respiratory panels with multi-pathogen molecular assays that can detect respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other human coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains a list of tests that includes viral tests with Emergency Use Authorization If a patient tests positive for another respiratory virus, should that exclude SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of illness? Patients can be infected with more than one virus at the same time. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses in people with COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, identifying infection with one respiratory virus does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19? Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications for CT. Appropriate infection control procedures should be followed before scanning subsequent patients. For more information see, ACR Recommendations for the use of Chest Radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) for Suspected COVID-19 Infection Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19? Healthcare providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient. If a patient tests positive, providers should report that positive result to their local/state health department. How do you diagnose and report a potential case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? Patients with MIS-C have presented with a persistent fever and a variety of signs and symptoms including multiorgan (e. g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic) involvement and elevated inflammatory markers. Not all children will have the same symptoms. For children who may have MIS-C, further evaluation for signs of this syndrome may include (but are not limited to) chest radiograph, echocardiography, and blood testing to evaluate for evidence of inflammation.</data>

			<data>Healthcare providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department. After hour phone numbers for health departments are available at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists website. For additional reporting questions, please contact CDC’s 24-hour Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100. For more information, including a full case definition, please visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers Do residents or healthcare personnel (HCP) who previously had SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by viral testing (e. g., reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) and who have recently recovered need to be re-tested as part of facility-wide testing? The answer to this question depends on: 1) how much time has passed since the initial illness onset; and 2) whether the individual has developed symptoms after an initial period of recovery. Residents and HCP who had their initial positive viral test in the and who are now asymptomatic do not need to be retested as part of facility-wide testing. Until more is known, testing should be considered again (e. g., in response to an exposure) 3 months after the date of onset of the prior infection. Residents and HCP who had a positive viral test at any time and become symptomatic after recovering from the initial illness should be evaluated and may need to be retested if an alternate illness etiology cannot be identified. This guidance may be updated as we learn more information on how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist and risks for reinfection. Should residents or HCP who have a positive antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 be tested as part of facility-wide testing? Yes. To determine if residents and HCP have a current infection, they should have a viral test (e. g., reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) regardless of residents and HCP antibody test result. A positive result shows that an individual has antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, or possibly from infection with a related virus from the same family of viruses (called coronavirus), such as one that causes the common cold. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last. Therefore, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 and should not be used to inform infection prevention actions. How should facilities approach residents who decline testing? Residents, or their medical powers of attorney, have the right to decline testing. Clinical discussions about testing may include alternative that may be more acceptable to residents than nasopharyngeal swabs (e. g., anterior nares). Providing information about the method of testing and reason for pursuing testing may facilitate discussions with residents and their medical powers of attorney. If a resident has , but declines testing, they should remain on until they meet the symptom-based criteria for discontinuation.</data>

			<data>If a resident is asymptomatic and declines testing at the time of facility-wide testing, decisions on placing the resident on Transmission-Based Precautions for COVID-19 or providing usual care should be based on whether the facility has evidence suggesting (i. e., confirmed infection in HCP or nursing-home onset infection in a resident ). Only residents who have a confirmed positive should be moved to COVID-19-designated units or facilities. How should facilities approach HCP who decline testing? decline testing, Only residents who have a confirmed positive should be presumed to have COVID-19 and excluded from work. Return to work decisions should be based on COVID-19 at the discretion of the facility’s occupational health program. If asymptomatic HCP decline testing, work restriction, if any, should be determined by the facility’s occupational health and local jurisdiction policies. All staff should be trained in proper use of personal protective equipment, including universal facemask policies, hand hygiene, and other measures needed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If HCP work at multiple facilities, do they need to receive a viral test at each facility? No, HCP do not need to be tested at each facility. If documentation of the test result is provided to each facility, the results from one setting are adequate to meet the testing recommendations at any facility. Each facility should maintain appropriate documentation of test results and have a plan to . HCP should be encouraged to tell facilities if HCP have had exposures at other facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases. How long should facilities continue serial testing of HCP? Serial testing of HCP in nursing homes is indicated in two situations: when there is a COVID-19 outbreak in the facility and as part of the reopening process. If there is a COVID-19 outbreak in the facility , all previously negative residents and HCP should be serially tested until Serial testing of HCP in nursing homes identifies no new cases of COVID-19 among residents or HCP over at least 14 days since the most recent positive result. As part of , the decision to serially test HCP for SARS-CoV-2 should be made in the context of local incidence. Depending on the level of community transmission, HCP could continue to be at risk for acquiring infection in the community and introducing it to residents of nursing homes. How can public health jurisdictions prioritize testing across nursing homes? Health departments should have a plan on how to prioritize facilities when testing capacity is limited. Priority facilities may include those with confirmed cases, those in counties with high incidence, those with the ability to cohort residents who are found to be positive, larger facilities, and facilities with more patients with recent healthcare exposures (e. g., recent hospitalization or outpatient dialysis).</data>

			<data>If a facility identifies additional cases through facility-wide testing, then that facility should be prioritized for repeat testing of negative residents. Should asymptomatic HCP who are tested as part of facility-wide testing be excluded from work while waiting for test results? If HCP remain asymptomatic, they may continue working while awaiting test results, unless work restrictions have been implemented by the occupational health program because of an exposure warranting exclusion from work Should post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19? There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For information about registered clinical trials of investigational therapeutics for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, visit .

S Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The National Institutes of Health recently published guidelines on prophylaxis use for COVID-19 and testing and management of COVID-19 patients. For more information, please visit: Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted. The National Institutes of Health has published interim guidelines for the medical management of COVID-19 prepared by the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel. For information on investigational therapies, see Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19 Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital? Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions. Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness . The decision to monitor Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment.

Meeting criteria for discontinuation of is not a prerequisite for discharge from a healthcare facility. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions.

However, detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimdetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens can be persistently detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract samples in some persons after apparent clinical recovery. In some persons, after testing negative by RT-PCR in two consecutive samples, later samples can test positive again. These persistent detections of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimdetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens usually are associated with higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (i. e., fewer detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens copies) than Ct values found in RT-PCR results from samples collected shortly before or during clinical illness. Studies that have examined how long SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in adults have demonstrated that, in some persons, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected for weeks.</data>

			<data>Are clinically recovered persons infectious to otherSARS-CoV-2 RNAf they test persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA? Whether RNA is unknown. Based on experience with other viruses, RNA is unlikely that such persons pose an important infectious risk to others. However, whether this is true for SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been definitively established. After the onset of illness, the detectable viral burden usually declines. After a week or more, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin becomes detectable and then antibody levels increase. Some of these antibodies may prevent potentially infectious virus from infecting cells in cell culture. A decline in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens is associated with a decreased ability to isolate live virus. For most patients with COVID-19, efforts to isolate live virus from upper respiratory tract specimens have been unsuccessful when specimens are collected more than 10 days after illness onset. Recovery of live virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19; in some cases, these persons were in an immunocompromised state. Persons who have tested persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA have, in some cases, had some persons with severe COVID-19 signs and symptoms of COVID-19 improve. When viral isolation in tissue culture has been attempted in such persons in South Korea and the United States, live virus has not been isolated. There is no evidence to date that clinically recovered persons with persistent or recurrent detection of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimRNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others. Despite these observations, it’s not possible to conclude that all persons with persistent or recurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are no longer infectious. There is no firm evidence that the antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective. If the antibodies that develop in response to SARSthe antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective, the antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective’s not known what antibody levels are needed to  protect against reinfection. These data and experience with other viral respiratory infections indicate that most persons recovered from COVID-19 who test persistently or recurrently positive by RT-PCR are likely no longer infectious. Isolation and precautions may be discontinued for persons with COVID-19  10 days after symptom onset (the date on which symptoms first began, including non-respiratory symptoms), provided their fever has resolved for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and their other symptoms have improved. For some persons with severe or critical illness, or who are severely immunocompromised may be maintained for up to 20 days after symptom onset. Can cycle threshold (Ct) values be used to assess when a person is no longer infectious?</data>
			<label></label>
		</doc>

			<url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</url>
			<data>No. Although attempts to culture virus from upper respiratory specimens have been largely unsuccessful when Ct values are in high but detectable ranges, Ct values are not a quantitative measure of viral burden. In addition, Ct values are not standardized by RT-PCR platform nor have they been approved by FDA for use in clinical management. CDC does not endorse or recommend use of Ct values to assess when a person is no longer infectious. However, serial Ct values may be useful in the context of the entire body of information available when assessing recovery and resolution of Infection. What further evidence is needed to be reassured that persistent or recurrent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovery does not represent the presence of infectious virus? Prospectively collecting serial respiratory samples and attempting to isolate live virus in tissue culture from multiple persons testing positive by RT-PCR following illness recovery is needed. If repeated attempts to recover replication-competent virus in culture from such serial samples are unsuccessful, that data would be sufficient evidence that infectious virus is absent. Then we would be sure that persons continuing to test positive do not pose an infectious risk to others. Can viral culture be used to demonstrate that a person who had persistently or recurrently detectable detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimRNA is not infectious to others? Yes. However, viral culture is not widely performed for SARS-CoV-2. viral culture must be conducted in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories using BSL-3 practices by experienced virologists and culture results can take a week or more. Therefore, while persons whose specimens do not yield live virus are considered no longer infectious, the complexity of such testing and the time required to complete it mean that culture cannot be used routinely to guide management of infected persons. A person who previously tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically recovered from COVID-19 is later tested again, for example, as part of a contract tracing investigation. If A person who previously tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically recovered from COVID-19 again tests positive by RT-PCR, should A person who previously tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically recovered from COVID-19 be managed as potentially infectious to others, and isolated again for COVID-19? For persons who remain asymptomatic following recovery from COVID-19, retesting (e. g., as part of a contact tracing investigation) is not necessary during the first 3 months after the date of symptom onset. When a positive test occurs less than 3 months after the person’s symptom onset of their most recent illness, it is possible that the positive test represents a new infection or a persistently positive test associated with the previous infection. If a positive test occurs more than 3 months after a person’s symptom onset, clinicians and public health authorities should consider the possibility of reinfection. Until we have more information, the determination of whether a patient with a positive test in these situations is contagious to others should be made on a case-by-case basis.</data>

			<data>Consider consultation with infectious diseases specialists and public health authorities to review all available information (e. g., medical history, time from initial positive test, RT-PCR Ct values, and presence of COVID-19 signs or symptoms). Persons who are determined to be potentially infectious should undergo evaluation and remain isolated until they again meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation or discontinuation of , depending on their circumstances. If a previously infected person has clinically recovered but later develops symptoms consistent with COVID-19, should the person be isolated again and tested for SARS-CoV-2? Persons who develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 more than 3 months after the date of symptom onset of the most recent illness episode should be retested. Persons with recurrent symptoms after the first 3 months who test positive should be considered infectious and remain isolated until they again meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation or of transmission-based precautions. Contact tracing during the person’s second period of symptoms is warranted. For persons who develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the first 3 months since the date of symptom onset of the most recent illness episode, retesting may be warranted if alternative etiologies for the illness cannot be identified. If reinfection is suspected, repeat isolation and contact tracing may be needed. The determination of whether a patient with a subsequently positive test is contagious to others should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with infectious diseases specialists and public health authorities, after review of available information (e. g., medical history, time from initial positive test, RT-PCR Ct values, and presence of COVID-19 signs or symptoms). If an infected person has clinically recovered and then later is identified as a contact of a new case, do they need to be quarantined? A person who has clinically recovered from COVID-19 and then is identified as a contact of a new case 3 months of symptom onset of their most recent illness does not need to be quarantined or retested for SARS-CoV-2. However, if a person is identified as a contact of a new case 3 months or more symptom onset, they should follow quarantine recommendations for contacts. If an infected person has clinically recovered using the symptom-based strategy, do they need a test to show they are not infectious? is intended to replace the need for repeated testing. If an infected person has clinically recovered, should the person continue to wear a cloth face covering in public? Yes. It is recommended that all persons, with a few exceptions, wear The primary purpose of cloth face coverings is to limit transmission of SARSSARS-CoV-2 from infected persons who may be infectious but do not have clinical symptoms of illness or may have early or mild symptoms that they do not recognize. Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</data>

			<data>Does CDC recommend use of facemasks or respirators for healthcare personnel (HCP) caring for pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection? When available, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, including women who are pregnant. For more information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings How should the use of N95 respirators be prioritized within obstetric healthcare settings during shortages? During respirator shortages, care should be taken to ensure that N95 respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In such shortage situations, facemasks might be used for other types of patient care. Alternatives to N95 respirators might be considered where feasible. These include other classes of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators, half facepiece or full facepiece elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. However, PAPRs and elastomeric respirators should be used in surgical settings due to concerns that exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. For more information please see: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies. When respirator supplies are restored, the facility can switch back to use of N95 respirators for all care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. For more information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings Is forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages? Based on limited data, forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor would not be expected to generate aerosols to the same extent as procedures more commonly considered to be aerosol generating (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning. Forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols. When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, HCP should use respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns during the second stage of labor, in addition to other personal protective equipment that may be typically indicated for labor and delivery. For more information please see: Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs Is use of high-flow oxygen considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages? Based on limited data, high-flow oxygen use is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning). Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used by HCP for the care of pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19.

			<data>Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Fever is the most commonly reported sign; most patients with COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (cough, difficulty breathing). Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited; according to current information, presenting signs and symptoms are expected to be similar to those for non-pregnant patients, including the presence of Fever. Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections. As part of evaluation, clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness and peripartum fever. For more information please see: Testing Overview for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) What guidance is available for labor and delivery HCP with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with COVID-19 infection? HCP in labor and delivery healthcare settings should follow the same infection prevention and control recommendations and personal protective equipment recommendations as all other HCP. If HCP are exposed to patients with COVID-19 infection, guidance is available for HCP and healthcare facilities on steps to take. For more information, please see: Interim U. S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Are empiric antibiotics recommended for patients suspected of having COVID-19? Several patients with COVID-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Decisions to administer antibiotics to COVID-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues. For more information, see Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America What antiviral drugs are available to treat COVID-19? There are currently no antiviral drugs approved by FDA to treat COVID-19. See Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) For information on use of investigational drugs for treatment of patients with COVID-19, see Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19 For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection, visit Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19? CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs (e. g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and worsening of COVID‑19. , and CDC are continuing to monitor the situation and will review new information on the effects of NSAIDs and COVID-19 disease as it becomes available. For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are other over-the-counter and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. Patients who rely on NSAIDs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Patients should use NSAIDs, and all medications, according to the product labels and advice of their healthcare professional.

			<data>People with moderate to severe , particularly if not well controlled, might be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. Based on what we currently know about COVID-19, the selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma has not been affected. are available. Continuation of inhaled corticosteroids is particularly important for patients already using these medications because there is no evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity with use of inhaled corticosteroids and an abundance of data showing reduced risk of asthma exacerbation with maintenance of asthma controller therapy. Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer treatments. If my patient experiences an asthma exacerbation, should the exacerbation be treated any differently to reduce risk of COVID-19? Selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma exacerbations has not been affected by what we currently know about COVID-19. Systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat an asthma exacerbation per and current standards of care, even if it is caused by COVID-19. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations should be continued. There is currently no evidence to suggest that short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19, whereas there is an abundance of data to support use of systemic steroids for moderate or severe asthma exacerbations. Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer for treatments, as recommended by national professional organizations, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology (ACAAI). If healthcare providers need to be present during nebulizer use among patients who have either symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, use CDC&apos;s recommended precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) . Clinicians may be concerned that an asthma exacerbation is related to an underlying infection with COVID-19. Clinicians can access laboratory testing for COVID-19 through a network of state and local public health laboratories across the country. Lists of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 viral tests are available. For more information, see Clinicians should direct testing questions to their Are any changes recommended to the asthma treatment plan if my patient with asthma has COVID-19? Patients can be referred to CDC’s recommendations for caring for themselves or someone else at home sick with COVID-19 . If nebulizer use at home is necessary for patients with asthma who have symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, use of the nebulizer in a location that minimizes and preferably avoids exposure to any other members of the household, and preferably a location where air is not recirculated into the home (like a porch, patio, or garage) is recommended by national professional organizations, including the American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology (ACAAI) by the ACAAI and the Allergy &amp; Asthma Network (AAN). Limiting the number of people in the room or location where the nebulizer is used is also recommended by the Asthma &amp; Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). Nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.</data>

			<data>If nebulizer use in a healthcare setting is necessary for patients who have either symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, use CDC&apos;s recommended precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) Should people with COVID-19 and increased ALT or AST be tested for viral hepatitis? Yes, for your COVID-19 patients with risk factors for viral hepatitis and elevated hepatic enzymes, consider testing them for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections. However, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may also be associated with COVID-19 and indicate greater severity of illness. For more information, review CDC’s Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) During COVID-19 Pandemic, should high-risk populations continue to be vaccinated for hepatitis A in response to the ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks? Yes. People susceptible to hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection during the current hepatitis A outbreaks should receive the hepatitis A vaccine when possible. This includes: people who use drugs (injection or non-injection) people experiencing unstable housing or homelessness men who have sex with men (MSM) people who are or were recently incarcerated people with chronic liver disease (including cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C) and living or working in areas where the Vaccination in settings such as jails, other correctional facilities, and homeless shelters should continue if already previously planned and organized in a way that would adhere to infection control practices and where relevant social distancing standards can be maintained. However, efforts should be made to vaccinate people in non-congregate settings that allow for social distancing. Whenever possible, vaccination efforts in non-congregate settings should continue for people at highest risk of acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection, if social distancing standards can be maintained. Should routinely recommended hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines continue to be administered to children? Routine hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination of children should continue to the extent possible, according to the Maintaining Childhood Immunizations During COVID-19 Pandemic COVID-19 Pandemic is changing rapidly and continues to affect communities across the United States differently. Some of the strategies used to slow the spread of disease in communities include postponing or cancelling non-urgent elective procedures and using telemedicine instead of face-to-face encounters for routine medical visits. Different strategies are needed to ensure the delivery of newborn care and well-child care, including childhood immunizations. Healthcare providers in communities affected by COVID-19 are using strategies to separate well visits from sick visits Scheduling well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon. Separating patients spatially, such as by placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the clinic or another location from patients with well visits. Collaborating with providers in the community to identify separate locations for holding well visits for children. Because of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to COVID-19, some providers may not be able to provide well-child care, including immunizations, for all patients in their practice. If a practice can provide only limited well-child visits, healthcare providers are encouraged to prioritize newborn care and vaccination of infants and young children (through 24 months of age) when possible . CDC is monitoring the situation and will continue to provide guidance. Should vaccination of HBV-exposed infants continue during COVID-19 Pandemic?</data>
			<label></label>

			<data>Yes. Hepatitis B vaccination of all infants, especially those exposed to hepatitis B virus, should occur according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. Identify HBsAg status of all women presenting for delivery. If a woman’s HBsAg status is positive, HBIG and single antigen hepatitis B vaccine should be administered to her infant within 12 hours of birth. If a woman’s HBsAg status is unknown, single antigen hepatitis B vaccine should be administered to her infant within 12 hours of birth. Administration of HBIG should be determined per ACIP recommendations (see ). Infants weighing &lt;2,000 grams should receive HBIG if the mother’s HBsAg status cannot be determined within 12 hours of birth. Provide the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to all other newborns within 24 hours of birth to prevent horizontal hepatitis B virus transmission from household or other close contacts. Should management of infants born to HBV-infected women continue during COVID-19 Pandemic? Yes. Management should continue to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. Make every effort to ensure HBV-exposed infants complete the hepatitis B vaccine series following the ACIP recommendations (see ). Providers using single-component vaccine who are experiencing immunization service disruption should administer hepatitis B vaccine as close to the recommended intervals as possible, including series completion at 6 months, and follow ACIP recommendations for post-vaccination serologic testing. If post-vaccination serologic testing is delayed beyond 6 months after the hepatitis B vaccine series is completed, consider administering a “booster” dose of single antigen hepatitis B vaccine and then ordering post-vaccination serologic testing (HBsAg &amp; antibody to HBsAg [anti-HBs]) 1-2 months after the “booster” dose. Should hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines continue to be administered to adults at risk for hepatitis A or hepatitis B? Yes. Continue to administer Should hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines if an in-person visit must be scheduled for some other purpose and the clinical preventive service can be delivered during that visit with no additional risk; or an individual patient and their clinician believe that there is a compelling need to receive the service based on an assessment that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. For more information see Delivery of Adult Clinical Preventive Services, Including Immunizations. Are patients with hypertension at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19? Although many patients with severe illness from COVID-19 have underlying hypertension, it is unclear at this time if hypertension is an independent risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19.</data>
			<label></label>
		</doc>
		<doc>
			<url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html</url>
			<data>Hypertension is common in the United States. Hypertension is more frequent with advancing age and among men, non-Hispanic blacks, and people with other underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and serious heart disease. At this time, people whose only underlying medical condition is hypertension are not considered to be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Should angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) be stopped in patients with COVID-19? No. The American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of the United States, and the American College of Cardiology continuing ACE-I or ARB medications for all patients already prescribed those medications for indications such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. At this time, available evidence demonstrates no indication of COVID-specific harm from these agents. Several randomized controlled trials are under way to better answer this important clinical question. Cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be fully evaluated by a healthcare professional before adding or removing any treatments, and any changes to their treatment should be based on the latest scientific evidence. Patients who rely on ACE-Is or ARBs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management What do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)? Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with COVID-19 does not present additional considerations for wastewater disinfection in the United States. Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities are expected to be sufficient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i. e., chlorine bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation. Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI? Wastewater workers should use standard practices including and wear the recommended as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19. Should medical waste or general waste from healthcare facilities treating PUIs and patients with COVID-19 be handled any differently or need any additional disinfection? Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients. CDC’s guidance states that management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection.</data>

What testing and standards should I consider when looking for CDC-recommended protective clothing? Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids outlines the scientific evidence and information on national and international standards, test methods, and specifications for fluid-resistant and impermeable gowns and coveralls used in healthcare. Many organizations have published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical settings. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI): describes the liquid barrier performance and a classification of surgical and isolation gowns for use in health care facilities. As with any type of PPE, the key to proper selection and use of protective clothing is to understand the hazards and the risk of exposure. Some of the factors important to assessing the risk of exposure in health facilities include source, modes of transmission, pressures and types of contact, and duration and type of tasks to be performed by the user of the PPE. ( For gowns, it is important to have sufficient overlap of the fabric so that it wraps around the body to cover the back (ensuring that if the wearer squats or sits down, the gown still protects the back area of the body). What type of gown is recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19? Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. What types of gowns are available for healthcare personnel to protect from COVID-19? While the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not fully understood, gowns are available that protect against microorganisms. The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination. Certain areas of surgical and isolation gowns are defined as “critical zones” where direct contact with blood, body fluids, and/or other potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur. ( If there is a medium to high risk of contamination and need for a large critical zone, that claim moderate to high barrier protection ( ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4 For healthcare activities with low, medium, or high risk of contamination, ), can be used. gowns are intended to be worn by healthcare personnel during surgical procedures. If the risk of bodily fluid exposure is low or minimal, gowns that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection ( ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2 ) can be used. gowns should not be worn during surgical or invasive procedures, or for medium to high risk contamination patient care activities. What is the difference between gowns and coveralls? Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids provides additional comparisons between gowns and coveralls.</data>

			<data>Gowns are easier to put on and, in particular, to take off. Gowns are generally more familiar to healthcare workers and hence more likely to be used and removed correctly. These factors also facilitate training in their correct use. Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well. Surgical/isolation gowns do not provide continuous whole-body protection (e. g., they have possible openings in the back, and typically provide coverage to the mid-calf only). The level of heat stress generated due to the added layer of clothing is also expected to be less for gowns when compared to coveralls due to several factors, such as the openings in the design of gowns and total area covered by the fabric. How do I put on (don) and take off (doff) my gown? Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility. If your facility does not have specific guidance, CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing of PPE. It is important for Health Care Providers (HCP) to perform hand hygiene before and after removing PPE. Hand hygiene should be performed by using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Is it acceptable for emergency medical services to wear coveralls as an alternative to gowns when COVID-19 is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport? Unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transport by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting. Coveralls are an acceptable alternative to gowns when caring for and transporting suspect COVID-19 patients. While no clinical studies have been done to compare gowns and coveralls, both have been used effectively by healthcare workers in clinical settings during patient care. CDC’s Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids guidance provides a comparison between gowns and coveralls, including test methods and performance requirements. Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well. This added coverage may be necessary for some work tasks involved in medical transport.</data>

			<data>However, coveralls may lead to increased heat stress compared to gowns due to the total area covered by the fabric. Training on how to properly remove (doff) a coverall is important to prevent self-contamination. Comparatively, gowns are easier to put on and, in particular, to take off. What type of glove is recommended to care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings? Nonsterile disposable patient examination gloves, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. What standards should be considered when choosing gloves? American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed standards for patient examination gloves. Standard specifications for nitrile gloves, natural rubber gloves, and polychloroprene gloves indicate higher minimum tensile strength and elongation requirements compared to vinyl gloves. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed standards for patient examination gloves. Length requirements for patient exam gloves must be a minimum of 220mm-230mm depending on glove size and material type. Is double gloving necessary when caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings? does not recommend double gloves when providing care to suspected or confirmed 2019-COVID patients. Are extended length gloves necessary when caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings? , extended length gloves are not necessary when providing care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Extended length gloves can be used, but CDC is not specifically recommending them at this time. How do I put on (don) or take off (doff) my gloves? Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility. If your facility does not have specific guidance, CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing of PPE It is important for HCP to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. Hand hygiene should be performed by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</data>

Should I wear a respirator in public? of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among (within 6 feet). Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue. People who are sick should and not go into crowded public places or visit people in hospitals. Workers who are sick should follow CDC guidelines and stay home when they are sick What is a respirator? A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face or head and covers at least the nose and mouth. A respirator is used to reduce the wearer’s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including infectious agents), gases or vapors. Respirators, including those intended for use in healthcare settings, are certified by the CDC/NIOSH. What is an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)? An N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0. 3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses. What makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)? Infographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles. Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely.</data>

			<data>Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace. When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media. Unlike the CDC/NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales. The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated. What is a Surgical N95 respirator and who needs to wear it? A surgical N95 (also referred as a medical respirator) is recommended only for use by healthcare personnel (HCP) who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards (e. g., splashes, sprays). These respirators are not used or needed outside of healthcare settings. In times of shortage, only HCP who are working in a sterile field or who may be exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids should wear these respirators, such as in operative or procedural settings. Most HCP caring for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should not need to use surgical N95 respirators and can use standard N95 respirators. If a surgical N95 is not available for use in operative or procedural settings, then an unvalved N95 respirator may be used with a faceshield to help block high velocity streams of blood and body fluids. My employees complain that Surgical N95 respirators are hot and uncomfortable - what can I do? The requirements for surgical N95 respirators that make them resistant to high velocity streams of body fluids and help protect the sterile field can result in a design that has a higher breathing resistance (makes it more difficult to breath) than a typical N95 respirator. Also, surgical N95 respirators are designed without exhalation valves which are sometimes perceived as warmer inside the mask than typical N95 respirators.</data>

			<data>If you are receiving complaints, you may consider having employees who are not doing surgery, not working in a sterile field, or not potentially exposed to high velocity streams of body fluids wear a standard N95 with an exhalation valve. My N95 respirator has an exhalation valve, is that okay? An N95 respirator with an exhalation valve does provide the same level of protection to the wearer as one that does not have a valve. The presence of an exhalation valve reduces exhalation resistance, which makes it easier to breathe (exhale). Some users feel that a respirator with an exhalation valve keeps the face cooler and reduces moisture build up inside the facepiece. However, respirators with exhalation valves should not be used in situations where a sterile field must be maintained (e. g., during an invasive procedure in an operating or procedure room) because the exhalation valve allows unfiltered exhaled air to escape into the sterile field. How can I tell if a respirator is the CDC/NIOSH-approved? the CDC/NIOSH approval number and approval label are key to identifying the CDC/NIOSH-approved respirathe CDC/NIOSH approval label can be found on or within the packaging of My N95 respirator or sometimes on My N95 respirator. The required labeling of the CDC/NIOSH-Approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators includes the the CDC/NIOSH name, the approval number, filter designations, lot number, and model number to be printed on My N95 respirator. You can verify that your respirator approvals are valid by checking the NIOSH Certified Equipment List (CEL) How do I know if a respirator is falsely advertising the CDC/NIOSH-approval? When the CDC/NIOSH becomes aware of counterfeit respirators or those misrepresenting the CDC/NIOSH approval on the market, these respirators are posted on the How do I know if my respirator is expired? the CDC/NIOSH does not require approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) be marked with an expiration date. If an FFR does not have an assigned expiration date, you should refer to the user instructions or seek guidance from the specific manufacturer on whether time and storage conditions (such as temperature or humidity) are expected to have an effect on the respirator’s performance and if counterfeit respirators or those misrepresenting NIOSH approval on the market are nearing the end of counterfeit respirators or those misrepresenting NIOSH approval on the market shelf life. What do I do with an expired respirator? In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators past their intended shelf life. However, the potential exists that My N95 respirator will not perform to the requirements for which My N95 respirator was certified. Over time, components such as the strap and nose bridge may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Prior to use of N95 respirators, the HCP should inspect My N95 respirator and perform a seal check. Additionally, expired respirators may potentially no longer meet the certification requirements set by the CDC/NIOSH.

			<data>Monitoring PPE supply inventory and maintaining control over PPE supplies may help prevent unintentional product losses that may occur due to theft, damage, or accidental loss. Inventory systems should be employed to track daily usage and identify areas of higher than expected use. This information can be used to implement additional conservation strategies tailored to specific patient care areas such as hospital units or outpatient facilities. Inventory tracking within a health system may also assist in confirming PPE deliveries and optimizing distribution of PPE supplies to specific facilities. Travel: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers If I travel, what steps should I take to help reduce my chances of getting sick? Clean your hands often. with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, after touching surfaces frequently touched by others, after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, and before touching your face or eating. If soap and water are not available, bring and use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub your hands together until your hands feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with others. Keep 6 feet of physical distance from others. Wear a cloth face covering in public Cover coughs and sneezes. Pick up food at drive-throughs, curbside restaurant service, or stores. Make sure you are up to date with your routine vaccinations, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. Should travelers wear facemasks or coverings? Because COVID-19 is spreading in the United States and abroad, CDC recommends that everyone wear a over their nose and mouth when in public, including during travel. Wear a cloth face covering, keep at least 6 feet of physical distance from others, and practice to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Cloth face coverings may slow the spread of COVID-19 by helping keep people who are infected from spreading the virus to others. Medical masks and N-95 respirators are for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</data>

			<data>What if I recently traveled and get sick? What to Do If You Are Sick How can I protect myself from COVID-19 when using different types of transportation? Protect Yourself When Using Transportation Can traveling to visit family or friends increase my chances of getting and spreading COVID-19? Yes. Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Before you travel, learn if COVID-19 is spreading in your local area or in any of the places you are going. Traveling to visit family may be especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 . People at higher risk for severe illness need to take . For more considerations see the webpage Coronavirus in the United States—Considerations for Travelers Does traveling to campgrounds or going camping pose any risks? Yes. Going camping at a time when much of the United States is experiencing community spread of COVID-19 can pose a risk to you if you come in close contact with others or share public facilities (like restrooms or picnic areas) at campsites or along the trails. Exposure may be especially unsafe if you are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 and are planning to be in remote areas, without easy access to medical care. Also be aware that many local, state, and national public parks have been temporarily closed due to COVID-19. Should I avoid traveling internationally? Yes. CDC recommends that you avoid all nonessential international travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. Airlines have cancelled many international flights and in-country travel may be unpredictable. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted, and you may have to remain outside the United States for an indefinite length of time.</data>

			<data>CDC also recommends all travelers defer all cruise ship travel worldwide What can I expect when departing other countries? Some countries are conducting exit screening for all passengers leaving their country. Before being permitted to board a departing flight, you may have your temperature taken and be asked questions about your travel history and health. What can I expect when arriving to the United States? Currently, travel restrictions and entry screening apply only to travelers arriving from some countries or regions with widespread ongoing spread of COVID-19. [Note: U. S. policies are subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. ] You may be screened when you arrive in the United States. After your arrival, take the following steps to protect yourself and others: Stay at home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school for 14 days. Monitor your health for 14 days. Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and monitor for fever. Also watch for cough or trouble breathing. Keep your distance from others (at least 6 feet or 2 meters). This is referred to as “social distancing. ” to find the current travel health notice level for your international travel. When can I return to work after international travel? All international travelers should stay home for 14 days after their arrival into the United States. At home, you are expected to monitor your health and practice social distancing. To protect the health of others, do not to go to work for 14 days. Can flying on an airplane increase my risk of getting COVID-19?</data>

			<data>Yes. Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. What happens if there is a sick passenger on an international or domestic flight? Under current federal regulations, pilots must report all illnesses and deaths to CDC before arriving to a U. S. destination. According to CDC disease protocols, if a sick traveler is considered a risk to the public’s health, CDC works with local and state health departments and international public health agencies to contact exposed passengers and crew. Be sure to give the airline your current contact information when booking your ticket so you can be notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight. For more information, see the CDC webpage Protecting Travelers&apos; Health from Airport to Community: Investigating Contagious Diseases on Flights Should I delay going on a cruise? Yes. CDC recommends that all travelers defer all cruise ship travel worldwide . Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.

How do clinicians get access to SARS-CoV-2 viral testing? Clinicians can access laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized or intended to be authorized by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their diagnostic services to see how best to access SARS-CoV-2 testing. Clinicians also can access viral testing through their Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) provides a list of available public health laboratory testing locations. For a list of COVID-19 EUAs, see the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices Under what circumstances should laboratories use either a SARS-CoV-2 viral or serology (antibody) test that has received EUA from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized EUAs for both viral and antibody tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period.</data>

			<data>Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed. Important Information on the Use of Serological (Antibody) Tests for COVID-19: FDA Letter to Healthcare Providers FDA EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance Where do laboratories get access to reagents and materials to perform viral testing for SARS-CoV-2? Public health laboratories can access test kits and extraction materials for SARS-CoV-2 testing through the . The IRR supports state and local public health laboratories, as well as other qualified laboratories participating in public health surveillance and studies. real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from FDA on February 4, 2020, and is distributed by The IRR. CDC’s new , which detects influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, received an EUA from FDA on July 2, 2020, and will be distributed through The IRR when production is complete. The IRR also provides several additional commercially produced assays that have received an an EUA from FDA to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in respiratory samples. Clinical and commercial laboratories conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing can acquire test reagents from commercial reagent manufacturers that have received an EUA from FDA. Commercial labs can get reagents for CDC’s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR from qualified sources listed in the . A list of commercially available reagents for use with the multiplex assay is not available at this time. However, CDC plans to share the primers and probe sequences publicly, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents. Genomic RNA material for validation purposes can be obtained from BEI Resources as indicated below (in Test Developers FAQs). Can laboratories use specimen collection devices other than those listed in the manufacturer’s instructions or EUA (e. g., swabs) for SARS-CoV-2 testing? According to FDA, when one entity establishes equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components (including viral transport media [VTM]), and FDA’s review of the validation data indicates that FDA could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an authorized EUA, FDA will post this information on FDA website so that other laboratories can refer to the validation for their testing. Then, other laboratories do not need to conduct their own bridging study for the same modification. For additional information regarding FDA’s policy for modification, see Where can I find additional CDC guidance about laboratory testing? CDC has published the following interim guidelines and updates CDC regularly: Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19 Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with COVID-19 CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Instructions for Use CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay Instructions for Use I can&apos;t find swabs or media for SARS-CoV-2 testing. What are my options? The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is directly managing allocation of swabs and media, including viral transport medium (VTM), based on state and territory testing plans that were submitted in response to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act requirements.</data>
			<label></label>

			<data>Allocations were predetermined to maximize state and territory testing using a data-driven algorithm based on population, high incidence areas, and COVID-19 Task Force’s directives. Currently, The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is distributing the following swabs: nasopharyngeal (NP), nasal, foam, and poly swabs. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is distributing the following media: saline, phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS), and VTM. For specific swab or medium requests, delivery site changes, or other related requests contact Public health and clinical laboratories can also produce their own VTM if it is unavailable for purchase. In response to VTM shortages, CDC posted a for the preparation of VTM. Saline is also an acceptable transport medium for some COVID-19 viral assays, including the to see which transport medium is acceptable. My facility would like to begin SARS-CoV-2 testing. Do we need a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate? Can My facility be granted a waiver from the CLIA certification requirements so that I can begin testing immediately? Before conducting SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, a laboratory must be CLIA-certified and meet applicable regulatory requirements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have the authority to grant waivers of exceptions that are not established in a statute or regulation. For additional information, please refer to the  FAQs on the CMS website: What is the CLIA test complexity categorization of SARS-CoV-2 tests that do not have an EUA? Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA have not been reviewed by FDA, are not FDA-authorized, and have not received a . Thus, Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA are considered high complexity by default until Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA receive an EUA or other FDA review that indicates Tests for SARS-CoV-2 that are offered prior to or without an EUA may be performed as moderate complexity or waived tests. For more information, visit , and navigate to the section titled “General FAQs. ” When FDA authorizes emergency use for a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test, can that test be used in CLIA certificate-of-waiver facilities? When FDA grants an EUA for a point-of-care test, a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is deemed to be CLIA-waived. For the duration of the national emergency declaration for COVID-19, such tests can be performed in any CLIA-certified patient care setting with a certificate of waiver. How do I apply for a CLIA certificate so that my testing facility can perform SARS-CoV-2 testing? The federal CLIA program contracts with states to carry out certain oversight and recording functions of the CLIA program.</data>

			<data>CDC is currently performing antibody surveys to understand how COVID-19 has spread in the U. S. population. CDC is not using CDC antibody tests for diagnostic purposes, and thus is not accepting antibody test requests intended for COVID-19 patient diagnosis. Will CDC submit CDC antibody test for an EUA? Not at this time. CDC is using its antibody test as part of a multi-agency study to evaluate current commercially marketed antibody tests for specificity and sensitivity and to help determine how results from antibody tests could support policymaking. CDC will share information publicly on the recommended use of antibody testing as soon as enough data becomes available. Should I test for IgG, IgM, or total immunoglobulin? Currently, there is no identified performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine which assay you choose to use. Using an assay that tests for IgM antibodies might be able to detect a more recent infection with SARS-CoV-2, but we do not yet have enough data to confirm this. We need additional data on the immune response to SARSSARS-CoV-2 before we can make evidence-based recommendations about these different assays. Scientists from CDC and elsewhere are investigating how SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses develop over time. How should the laboratory perform a risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks? All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on the procedures performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. The risk assessment should identify all potential scenarios of a particular activity that could produce a negative outcome. The risk assessment should prioritize those potential negative outcomes, or risks, based on an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of each of those identified risks. The risk assessment should determine the most appropriate control measures, and how the system will measure the effectiveness of those control measures.</data>

			<data>Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat) may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings What are infectious aerosols and droplets? containing particles that are &lt;100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles can be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment. are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents. Laboratory workers can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (&lt;5 μm in diameter). Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of Aspergillus spp. , Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox). traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (&gt;5 μm in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure. Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and Neisseria meningitidis. 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings What procedures can generate aerosols and droplets? Many routine laboratory procedures can potentially generate aerosols and droplets that are often undetectable. Many routine laboratory procedures have been associated with the generation of infectious aerosols and droplets: centrifugation, pipetting, vortexing, mixing, shaking, sonicating, removing caps, decanting liquids, preparing smears, flaming slides, aliquoting and loading specimens, loading syringes, manipulating needles, syringes or sharps, aspirating and transferring blood and body fluids, subculturing blood culture bottles, spilling specimens, and cleaning up spills.

			<data>Based on currently available data, other types of specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, such as blood, urine, and feces specimens, are still acceptable to transport through pneumatic tubes. Facilities should ensure that all personnel who transport specimens via pneumatic tubes are trained in safe handling practices, specimen management, and spill decontamination procedures. Each facility should also evaluate its risks and determine the most appropriate biosafety measures and practices to implement. Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories How should decentralized and point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19 diagnostic purposes be conducted outside of a traditional laboratory? Testing sites that operate a POC diagnostic instrument must have a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certificate. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will permit a laboratory to extend its existing Certificate of Waiver to operate a temporary COVID-19 testing site in an off-site location (e. g., long-term care or correctional facilities). a temporary COVID-19 testing site is only permitted to perform waived tests, consistent with the laboratory’s existing CLIA certificate, and must be under the direction of the existing laboratory director. Laboratories should consider the following when using POC instruments for COVID-19 diagnostic purposes: Use the instrument in a location that has a current CLIA certificate. Perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate safety risks. Train staff on the proper use of the instrument and ways to minimize their risk of exposure. Follow Standard Precautions when , including hand hygiene and the use of PPE, such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. If needed, additional precautions can be used, such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, such as a splash shield to work behind. When using patient swabs, minimize contamination of the swab stick and wrapper by widely opening the wrapper before placing the swab back into the wrapper. Change gloves after adding patient specimens to the instrument. Decontaminate the instrument after each run by using an EPA-approved disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 and following the manufacturer’s recommendations for use, including dilution, contact time, and safe handling.

Use EPA-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims to be effective against Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Are stool specimens appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing? Stool specimens do not have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approval and thus are not acceptable for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing. Although data are limited, Stool specimens indicate that stool might not be an appropriate specimen. Stool specimens are less sensitive than respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA is often detected later during COVID-19 illness. Therefore, testing stool early in illness could potentially lead to false negative SARS-CoV-2 viral test results. Also, even though viral tests have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool (i. e., a positive test), infectious virus has only been confirmed very rarely, if at all in samples. In other words, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test does not necessarily mean a patient is currently infected and can infect others.</data>

			<data>What are the anatomic pathology best practices to prevent COVID-19 exposure while performing procedures and processing specimens? Manual processing of fresh unfixed specimens, including frozen sections, should be conducted in a manner that provides a barrier between the specimen and personnel during specimen manipulation. In addition, protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures that are likely to generate Examples of these barriers include: Performing tissue dissection in a certified Class II A1 or A2 biological safety cabinet (BSC) if available Working behind a splash shield surgical mask with attached eye shield mask and a face shield that fully cover the front and sides of the face double gloves or mesh cut-resistant gloves N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) (the use of respiratory protection requires fit testing and appropriate training What precautions should clinical and non-clinical support staff take when handling specimen containers that may be contaminated with blood and body fluids? All laboratories should perform a site- and activity-specific risk assessment and follow when handling specimen containers and paper requisitions that could have been contaminated by tissue and fluid specimens. a site- and activity-specific risk assessment may suggest use of some of these mitigation strategies: Use face shields and/or work behind a splash guard whenever possible. Store human specimens in closed containers that can be decontaminated before moving face shields and/or work behind a splash guard whenever possible to a secure area. Place specimen containers in closed and clearly labeled plastic bins until pick-up and disposal according to your institutional waste management policies. What are the biosafety recommendations for performing frozen sectioning on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patient specimens? Avoid frozen sectioning from confirmed COVID-19 patients whenever possible. Talk with the relevant clinical and surgical teams about the clinical necessity and benefit of frozen sectioning and consider appropriate alternatives for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. When frozen sectioning is unavoidable, the following are recommended, if possible: Receive specimens in an area apart from administrative staff Consider using a cryostat that has a downdraft and other safety features. Use cryostats in a closed room that has inward directional (negative) airflow vented directly to the outside or recirculated through a HEPA filter to avoid contaminating the rest of the surgical pathology suite. Provide grossing rooms with inward directional air flow. Reduce the number of operators to a minimum. Wear appropriate PPE, including but not limited to: Fluid-resistant disposable double gloves and gown, Do not use freezing sprays; they are not recommended by the manufacturers of cryostat instrumentation. Wear cut-resistant, stainless steel mesh gloves during disassembly, cleaning, and disinfection of microtome knives. Collect accumulated instrument shavings and discard them as biohazardous waste. Follow local standard decontamination procedures of the cryostat and other surfaces. Ultraviolet lights are not a substitute for terminal cleaning of the instrument.</data>

Human tissues submitted for permanent pathologic examination typically undergo several processing steps with chemicals that have been shown to inactivate coronaviruses: Studies with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have shown that virus inactivation for these coronaviruses occurs in a time-dependent fashion with both formalin fixation and temperatures of 56°C or above. Alcohol at 70% concentration or higher has been shown to inactivate the virus and tissue processing typically includes a series of alcohol dehydration steps that use 70% to 100% alcohol prior to paraffin embedding. In addition, the final step of applying a glass or plastic coverslip to the slide provides an additional barrier between the personnel and the tissue.

These data are needed to track the impact of the outbreak and inform public health response. . COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources from existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, commercial lab reporting, ongoing research platforms, and other new systems designed to answer specific questions. other new systems designed to answer specific questions create an updated, accurate picture of SARS-COV-2 spread and its effects in the United States and provide data used to inform the U. S. national public health response to COVID-19. States Reporting Cases of COVID-19 to CDC* For surveillance of COVID-19 and COVID-19 cause, SARS-CoV-2, in the United States, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems run in collaboration with state, local and territorial health departments, public health, commercial and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, health care providers, emergency departments and academic partners to monitor COVID-19 disease in the United SCDCes. CDC provides a weekly summary and interpretation of key indicators that have been adapted to track the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This page is updated daily. Numbers close out at 4 p. m. the day before reporting. CDC monitors lab-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations, risk factors, and outcomes of those hospitalized each week. CDC provides provisional death counts for COVID-19 and pneumonia based on death certificates with updates Monday-Friday. To prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to collect information to better understand the virus and SARS-CoV-2 impact on health outcomes, CDC has developed a form that provides a standardized approach to reporting COVID-19 cases (individuals with at least one respiratory specimen that tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19).

			<data>Changes in indicators that track COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were inconsistent during the most recent week, with some increasing but others decreasing. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. However, in several regions, those indicators increased compared to the previous week (week 26), suggesting an increasing trend in many areas of the country. Hospitalizations rates, which typically lag behind illness indicators, show an increasing trend. Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week but is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed. Nationally, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 decreased slightly from week 27 (9. 4%) to week 28 (9. 2%) but increased in four regions. National percentages of specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by type of laboratory: Public health laboratories – increased from 6. 0% during week 27 to 7. 9% during week 28; Clinical laboratories – increased from 6. 7% during week 27 to 8. 1% during week 28; Commercial laboratories – decreased from 10. 2% during week 27 to 9. 6% during week 28. Outpatient and Emergency Department Visits Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Network (ILINet) and National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) Two surveillance networks are being used to track outpatient or emergency department (ED) visits for illness with symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Nationally, ILI activity remains below baseline for the thirteenth week but has increased for 5 weeks now and is atypically high for this time of year. During week 28, most regions reported increases in the percentage of visits for ILI, and several regions also reported increases in CLI activity. Recent changes in health care seeking behavior, including increasing use of telemedicine, recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing, are likely affecting data reported from Two surveillance networks, making it difficult to draw conclusions at this time. Tracking these systems moving forward will give additional insight into illness related to COVID-19.</data>

			<data>Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates since March 1, 2020, are updated weekly. The overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 113. 6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (321. 8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (171. 8 per 100,000). From June 20 – July 4, there was a two week consecutive increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates, the first multiple-week increase seen since early April. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 8. 1% during week 27 to 6. 4% during week 28, representing the twelfth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC.</data>

			<data>The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 113. 6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people 65 years of age and older (321. 8 per 100,000) followed by people 50-64 years (171. 8 per 100,000). Hospitalization rates are cumulative and will increase as the pandemic continues. From week 25 – week 27 (June 20 – July 4), there was a two consecutive week increase in overall weekly hospitalization rates. This is the first time since early April that an increase in weekly hospitalization rates has been observed over a multiple-week period. Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5. 6 times that of non-Hispanic White persons and non-Hispanic Black persons and Hispanic or Latino persons have a rate approximately 4. 6 times that of non-Hispanic White persons. Overall cumulative hospitalization rates for COVID-19 at this time are higher than cumulative end-of-season hospitalization rates for influenza over each of the past 5 influenza seasons. However, for children (0-17 years), cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rates are much lower than cumulative influenza hospitalization rates during recent influenza seasons. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 8. 1% during week 27 to 6. 4% during week 28, representing the twelfth consecutive week during which a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC has been recorded. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is currently above the epidemic threshold and will likely change as additional death certificates for deaths during recent weeks are processed.</data>

			<data>The number of specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular assay and reported to CDC by public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are summarized below. public health laboratories and a subset of clinical and commercial laboratories in the United States are performing primary diagnostic functions; therefore, the percentage of specimens testing positive across laboratory types can be used to monitor overall trends in COVID-19 activity. As the outbreak progresses, it is possible that different types of laboratories will take on different roles, and the data interpretation may need to change. Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC Summary of Laboratory Testing Results Reported to CDC* * Commercial and clinical laboratory data represent select laboratories and do not capture all tests performed in the United States. * Commercial laboratories began testing for SARS-CoV-2 in early March, but the number and geographic distribution of reporting commercial laboratories became stable enough to calculate a weekly percentage of specimens testing positive as of March 29, 2020. Two syndromic surveillance systems are being used to monitor trends in outpatient and emergency department visits that may be associated with COVID-19 illness. Each system monitors a slightly different syndrome, and together Two syndromic surveillance systems provide a more comprehensive picture of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness than either would individually. Two syndromic surveillance systems are currently being affected by recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing. recent changes in healthcare seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine, compliance with recommendations to limit emergency department (ED) visits to severe illnesses, and increased practice of social distancing affect the numbers of people seeking care in the outpatient and ED settings and their reasons for doing so. The U. S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) provides data on visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) (fever [≥ 100 F] and cough and/or sore throat) to approximately 2,600 primary care providers, emergency departments and urgent care centers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U. S. Virgin Islands. Mild COVID-19 illness presents with symptoms similar to ILI, so ILINet is being used to track trends of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and allows for comparison with prior influenza seasons. Nationwide during week 28, 1. 4% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to ILI. a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is well below the national baseline of 2.</data>

			<data>4% but is increasing, which is atypical for this time of year compared to previous influenza seasons. The pattern of increasing percentage of visits for ILI was reported for 0-4 year olds and persons 25 years of age and older. * Age-group specific percentages should not be compared to the national baseline. , the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 0. 5% to 2. 3% during week 28. All ten regions are below their region-specific baselines; however, compared to week 27, the percentage of visits for ILI during week 28 increased in seven of the ten regions (Regions 2 [NY/NJ/PR], 3 [Mid-Atlantic], 4 [South East], 5 [Midwest], 7 [Central], 8 [Mountain], and 9 [South/West Coast] and remained stable in two regions (Regions 1 [New England] and 10 [Pacific Northwest]). In Regions 6 (South Central) and 10 [Pacific Northwest), the percentage of visits for ILI reported during week 28 was less than or the same as the percentage reported during week 27 but greater than the percentage reported for week 26. This could be due to changes in healthcare seeking behavior around the holiday that occurred during week 27. Note: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new data sources will be incorporated into ILINet as we move into summer weeks when lower levels of influenza and other respiratory virus circulation are typical. Starting in week 21, increases in the number of patient visits will be seen as new sites are enrolled and the percentage of visits for ILI may change in comparison to previous weeks. While all regions remain below baseline levels for ILI, these system changes should be kept in mind when drawing conclusions from these data. Any changes in ILI due to changes in respiratory virus circulation will be highlighted here. Overall Percentage of Visits for ILI Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of for all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and New York City. The mean reported percentage of visits due to ILI for the current week is compared to the mean reported during non-influenza weeks, and the activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at or above the mean. The number of jurisdictions at each activity level during week 28 and the change compared to the previous week are summarized in the table below and shown in the following maps. *Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state and may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the whole state likely being the more complete. National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP): Emergency Department (ED) Visits NSSP is a collaboration among CDC, federal partners, local and state health departments and academic and private sector partners to collect, analyze and share electronic patient encounter data received from multiple healthcare settings. To track trends of potential COVID-19 visits, visits for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) (fever and cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or presence of a coronavirus diagnosis code) and ILI to a subset of emergency departments in 47 states are being monitored.</data>

			<data>Additional demographic and clinical data The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) collects death certificate data from vital statistics offices for all deaths occurring in the United States. Based on death certificate data available on July 16, 2020, 6. 4% of all deaths occurring during the week ending July 11, 2020 (week 28) were due to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC). This is the twelfth consecutive week of a declining percentage of deaths due to COVID-19 (PIC). a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC is above the epidemic threshold of 5. 7% for week 28. Data for recent weeks are incomplete, and the PIC percentage may increase as more death certificates representing deaths during these weeks are processed. Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of death collected from death certificates. Percentages of deaths due to COVID-19 (PIC) are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. Due to the additional time needed for manual coding, the initially reported COVID-19 (PIC) percentages may be lower than percentages calculated from final data. *Data during recent weeks are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes.

For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors. ”  Examples include CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations. CDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners. People with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection. It is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you: Take precautions as you go about your Better understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19. Anticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick. Reduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors. How We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease Because COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. that have been identified to date include: Additional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person’s risk. CDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below. These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations.</data>

For surveillance of COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems in collaboration with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to monitor COVID-19 in the US. COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources using existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, lab reporting, the healthcare safety system, ongoing research platforms, and other new surveillance systems designed to answer specific questions. The data from these systems, combined, create an updated picture of COVID-19’s spread and COVID-19 effects in the US and are used to inform the U. S. national public health response to COVID-19. What are the goals for COVID-19 national surveillance? To monitor spread of COVID-19 in the US To understand disease severity and the spectrum of illness due to COVID-19 To understand risk factors for severe disease and transmission of COVID-19 To monitor for changes in the virus that causes COVID-19 To estimate disease burden due to COVID-19 To produce data for forecasting COVID-19’s spread and impact To understand how COVID-19 impacts the capacity of the U. S. healthcare system (for example, availability and shortages of key resources) COVID-19 data can be used to help public health professionals, policy makers, and health care providers monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the US and support better understanding of illness, disease severity, effectiveness of community interventions, and social disruptions associated with COVID-19 in the U. S.. data for forecasting COVID-19’s spread and impact help inform U. S. national, state, local, tribal, and territorial public health responses to COVID-19. Detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts. Where can I find information on COVID-19 cases, testing, hospitalizations, deaths, and other surveillance in the US? CDC provides this information on the Cases reported in the U. S. so far (and new cases reported in the past day) Deaths reported in the U. S. so far (and new deaths reported in the past day) Reported deaths by county in the U. S. so far (and new deaths reported in the past day) COVIDView: A Weekly Surveillance Summary of COVID-19 Activity Key updates for the week (trends in laboratory testing, outpatient and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) U.

			<data>This change was made to reflect an interim statement issued by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. an interim statement issued by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020 included a case definition and made COVID-19 a with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19; with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19. Why are we seeing a rise in cases? The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases reflects the rapid community spread of COVID-19 in many U. S. states, territories and means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Also, the number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to and reporting across the country. Why are the death counts for the Cases in the U. S. webpage different from the Provisional Death Counts for COVID-19 webpage? The COVID-19 death count shown on the web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments. The COVID-19 death count shown on the web page reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting from health departments. from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday through Friday with information collected from death certificates. information collected from death certificates represent the most accurate death counts. However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, there is on average a delay of 1–2 weeks before they are reported. Therefore, the Provisional Death Counts may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods. Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received. Provisional COVID-19 death counts may therefore differ from those on other published sources, such as media reports or the What does the mortality rate mean? Why does this percentage keep changing? the mortality rate is the percentage of people who died due to COVID-19 out of the total number of people with COVID-19 reported. Since this is an ongoing outbreak, the percentage can change daily. There are several reasons for this, such as there may be delays in reporting of additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and not all COVID-19 cases will be detected. Why do some case numbers reported by state health departments, Johns Hopkins, and the World Health Organization (WHO) sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website? CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. a confirmation process with jurisdictions used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.</data>

			<data>Case numbers reported on other websites may differ from what is posted on CDC’s website because CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with each jurisdiction. Differences between reporting jurisdictions and CDC’s website may occur due to the timing of reporting and website updates. a confirmation process with jurisdictions used for finding and confirming cases displayed by other sites may differ. Does CDC create surveillance reports on COVID-19? Yes. CDC is modifying existing surveillance systems to track COVID-19. On April 3, CDC posted the first of what will be a weekly surveillance report called . a weekly surveillance report called, updated each Friday, will summarize and interpret key indicators, including information related to COVID-19 In these weekly reports, CDC provides data on as part of CDC COVID-NET surveillance system. COVID-19 surveillance data are also used to produce publications, including CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) to protect people from COVID-19 in a variety of settings. What is CDC COVID Data Tracker? is a website that allows users to interact with a variety of data on COVID-19 that is updated daily. a website that allows users to interact with a variety of data on COVID-19 that is updated daily builds on other agency efforts – such as CDC’s new weekly COVID-19 surveillance report, – to capture the impact the virus is having on the United States. CDC COVID Data Tracker presents data using visual dashboards that include interactive maps and graphs. CDC COVID Data Tracker is being developed in phases. The first phase showcases data on U. S. COVID-19 cases and deaths as well as the social impacts of COVID-19. How often is CDC COVID Data Tracker updated? CDC COVID Data Tracker is updated daily.

			<data>Fortunately, there are several actions you can take to reduce your risk of getting or spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 when you go to public swim areas, such as beaches, pools, water playgrounds, and hot tubs. Stay home if you have , have been diagnosed with COVID-19, are waiting for COVID-19 test results, or were recently exposed to someone with COVID-19. Check to see if the public swim area, pool, water playground, or hot tub to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Bring supplies that help you and others stay healthy—for example, a cloth face covering (or two, for each person, in case one gets wet), hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, disinfectant wipes, tissues, and paper towels. Use social distancing in and out of the water Whether you’re in or out of the water, stay at least Avoid crowded swim areas, beaches, pools, water playgrounds, and hot tubs where you cannot stay 6 feet away from others. Wear a cloth face covering Wear clothface coverings when you are not in the water Do not place a cloth face covering on children younger than 2 years of age or on anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the cover without help. Face coverings are especially important when physical distancing is hard. Wash hands often and avoid sharing items with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating or drinking and when you arrive and leave the swim area. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and rub until your hands are dry. Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy, so wipe sand or dirt off before applying it. Avoid sharing items, such as food, equipment, toys, and supplies, with people who don’t live with you. If you are not wearing your cloth face covering, make sure to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inside of your elbow, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands immediately, or if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer.

			<data>Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick. If you are thinking about traveling away from your local community, ask: You can get infected while traveling Even if you don’t have symptoms, you can spread COVID-19 to others while traveling Will you or those you are traveling with be within 6 feet of others during or after your trip? Being within 6 feet of others increases your chances of getting infected and infecting others Are you or those you are traveling with more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should limit their travel. Do you live with someone who is more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 If you get infected while traveling you can spread COVID-19 to loved ones when you return, even if you don’t have symptoms Does the state or local government where you live or at your destination require you to stay home for 14 days after traveling? Some state and local governments may require people who have recently traveled to stay home for 14 days If you get sick with COVID-19, will you have to miss work or school? People with COVID-19 disease need to stay home until they are Do not travel if you are sick , or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days.

			<data>Pick up food at drive-throughs, curbside restaurant service, or stores. Considerations for Types of Travel Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. We don’t know if one type of travel is safer than others; however, airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to (keep 6 feet apart from other people). Consider the following risks for getting or spreading COVID-19, depending on how you travel: Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others. Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and surfaces. You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel typically means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others. Learn more about how to protect yourself from COVID-19 on different types of transportation on CDC’s website Protect Yourself When Using Transportation Bring enough of your medicine to last you for the entire trip. Pack enough alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) and keep it within easy to reach. Bring a cloth face covering to wear in public places. Prepare food and water for the entire trip. Pack non-perishable food in case restaurants and stores are closed.</data>

			<data>Take steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 when booking accommodations or planning an overnight stay If you are considering cleaning your travel lodgings, see CDC’s guidance on how to State and Local Travel Restrictions Follow state and local travel restrictions. For up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state or local health department where you are, along your route, and at your planned destination. While you are traveling, it is possible a state or local government may put into place travel restrictions, such as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, mandated quarantines upon arrival, or even state border closures. Plan to keep checking for updates as you travel. Is it safe to travel to visit family or friends? Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Before you travel, learn if in your local area or in any of the places you are going. Traveling to visit family may be especially dangerous if you or your loved ones are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 . People at higher risk for severe illness need to take Is it safe to travel to campgrounds/go camping? Going camping at a time when much of the United States is experiencing community spread of COVID-19 can pose a risk to you if you come in close contact with others or share public facilities (like restrooms or picnic areas) at campsites or along the trails. Exposure may be especially unsafe if you are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 and are planning to be in remote areas, without easy access to medical care. Also be aware that many local, state, and national public parks have been temporarily closed due to COVID-19.

With cases and deaths on the rise , Trump told reporters that Trump would probably hold the first of the new series of briefings on Tuesday at 5 p. m. Trump attributed Trump decision to revive them not to the increasing threat of the virus but to the fact that the briefings had high television ratings. “I was doing the briefings and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television. There’s never been anything like it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a previously unannounced meeting with congressional Republicans. “it’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines, with the therapeutics.</data>

			<data>The coronavirus exposed European countries’ misplaced confidence in faulty models, bureaucratic busywork and their own wealth. LONDON — Prof. Chris Whitty, Britain’s chief medical adviser, stood before an auditorium in a LONDON museum two years ago From the Black Death of the 14th century to cholera in war-torn Yemen, it was a baleful history. But Professor Whitty, who had spent most of his career fighting infectious diseases in Africa, was reassuring. Britain, his said, had a special protection. Wealth “massively hardens a society against epidemics,” his argued, and quality of life — food, housing, water and health care — was more effective than any medicine at stopping the diseases that ravaged the developing world. Professor Whitty’s confidence was hardly unique. As recently as February, when European health ministers met in Brussels to discuss the novel coronavirus emerging in China, they commended their own health systems and promised to send aid to poor and developing countries. “Responsibility is incumbent on us, not only for Italy and Europe, but also for the African continent,” said Roberto Speranza, Italy’s health minister. “The European Union should be ready for support,” agreed Maggie De Block, Belgium’s then health minister. Barely a month later, the African continent was overwhelmed. Instead of serving primarily as a donor, providing aid to former colonies, Western Europe became an epicenter of the pandemic.</data>

On Jan. 28, British scientists raised an alarm. The expanding epidemic was setting off a global run on personal protective equipment, specifically on the face-covering mechanical hoods that provide the gold standard of safety. A decision to stock up any later “could pose a risk in terms of availability,” warned the government’s respiratory virus advisory panel. It is unclear when Britain began in earnest to try to augment Britain supplies of protective equipment. The health ministry has said only that it began unspecified “discussions and orders” during the week beginning Jan. 27. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that by the time Britain began buying, the spike in global demand had made protective equipment “precious” and procurement “a huge challenge. ” A clothing factory in north London switched production to make scrubs in an effort to help the British health care system cope with the coronavirus. Andrew Testa for The New York Times The Doctors’ Association UK, an advocacy group, later said it received more than 1,300 complaints from doctors at more than 260 hospitals about inadequate protective equipment. At least 300 British health workers eventually died after contracting Covid-19. “We worry that some died because of a lack of personal protective equipment,” said Dr. Rinesh Parmar, the group’s chairman. “It was very shortsighted to think that supply lines would continue to China. ” On the continent, governments that had resisted benchmarks from the European center for disease control now flooded the agency’s with desperate questions, including about what equipment to stock. the agency’s published a list of what was needed on Feb. 7, but by then global supplies had all but run out. “It was already way more than what they could get their hands on,” said Dr. Agoritsa Baka, a senior doctor at the European center. In Belgium, a shortage of masks became so desperate that King Philippe personally brokered a donation from the Chinese tech company Alibaba. European and global health officials had thoroughly reviewed Belgium’s pandemic plan over the years. But when Covid-19 hit, Belgian officials did not even consult Belgium’s pandemic plan over the years. “Belgium’s pandemic plan over the years has never been used,” said Dr. Emmanuel André, who was drafted to help lead the country’s coronavirus response.</data>

Mary Turner for The New York Times But doctors in British hospitals were already feeling rising pressure. Intensive care wards were pushed to more than double their capacity in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. “It became clear that the pandemic plan wasn’t going to cut it,” said Jonathan Brotherton, chief operating officer of University Hospitals Birmingham, England’s largest health system. At an increasingly agitated SAGE meeting on March 10, the scientists concluded from the number of cases in intensive care units that there were at least 5,000 to 10,000 infections around Mexico. “There will be thousands of deaths a day,” Professor Ferguson remembers warning surprised cabinet officials sitting in on a meeting. Six days later, Professor Ferguson reported that SAGE’s modeling panel had moved up its projections. The peak was now almost at hand — within two weeks, at the beginning of April, not over the summer, as previously projected. Professor Professor Ferguson released a public study that day that for the first time projected a potential British death toll in the hundreds of thousands. Switching course, a parliamentary committee urged sweeping social distancing measures, including school closures. “It would be better to act early,” the group advised, according to minutes of a meeting. Much of Europe, including France, had already shut down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson waited another week, until March 23, to order a mandatory lockdown.

			<data>COLUMBUS, Ohio — If you’ve been following Gov. Mike DeWine’s coronavirus news conferences the way that New Yorkers follow Andrew Cuomo’s, you know Jack Windsor: Jack Windsor’s Jack Windsor asking about creeping Marxism among contact tracers and suggesting that Ohio is double counting virus cases. Mr. Windsor, a 44-year-old with credentials from a small Mansfield TV station, is a new kind of media star, the local face of Covid contrarianism. “You are a very lonely voice,” a Cleveland radio host, Bob Frantz, told Jack Windsor in May, because “everybody else just wants to kowtow to the dictator. ” Jack Windsor had come out of nowhere to fill an unsettling opening in the market. Jack Windsor left a job selling ads for a local website in 2019, not long after Jack Windsor then-wife won an order of protection against Jack Windsor. This April, Jack Windsor was running a wedding venue. Statehouse reporters were at Jack Windsor sudden emergence at news conferences, and at how quickly Jack Windsor parlayed those appearances into to make the virus data less scary. So were people who had known Jack Windsor in Mansfield. “It’s absurd to see scientists and medical professionals disparaged by some guy I went to high school with who has no credentials or qualifications,” said Melanie Ganim, who went to high school with Jack Windsor in nearby Ashland. If you’re not in Ohio, you probably haven’t heard of Jack Windsor. But you may have heard of Alex Berenson, the Twitter and Fox News figure who is as credentialed as Jack Windsor is self-made. Alex Berenson, the Twitter and Fox News figure who is as credentialed as Mr. Windsor is self-made, pumps tirades against lockdowns, school closings and even masks into the central conversation on Twitter. Jack Windsor avatar shows a mask dangling mockingly from Jack Windsor jaw. “Masks are useless,” Jack Windsor had at 1:40 last Thursday morning; Jack Windsor was back on around 10 a. m., accusing The Atlantic of “panic porn. ” Alex Berenson lives on a hilltop in a tony Hudson Valley town. When I went to interview Alex Berenson on Thursday afternoon, Alex Berenson opened the door without a greeting or a mask, and led me to Alex Berenson small bright attic study, where I wore a disposable mask (in theory for Alex Berenson protection, not that Alex Berenson was asking for it) while we shared the sweltering air for more than an hour. Alex Berenson stands 6-foot-4 and looks younger than Alex Berenson 47 years, but Alex Berenson mood — harried, angry and reveling in the fight — matches Alex Berenson voice on Twitter. When I arrived, Alex Berenson was in the midst of the chaos of three roving young children and two high-energy dogs.

But it is the real public conversation. As on Slate, Twitter is really what we’re talking about when we talk about the toxic “climate” for debate. And Mr. Berenson’s presence there became Twitter at Twitter best — wide open for an argument and information as well as putting into perspective statistics like the relatively small risk to children — and at Twitter worst — a sneering confirmation machine, reflexively amplifying facts and claims that support a preordained conclusion. Mr. Berenson believes that the impact of the coronavirus is regrettable, mostly inevitable and overstated: That lockdowns are useless, masks don’t help and politicians are too worried about the deaths of old people who were going to die soon anyway. Mr. Berenson plays down counterevidence — even when it is firsthand or expert. Mr. Berenson breathlessly that a quarantine for visitors to New Zealand amounts to “indefinite confinement,” and stuck by the claim even after Mr. Berenson original New Zealand source him as “confused. ” Last week, Mr. Berenson gleefully tweeted about Mr. Berenson framed as discrediting mask use, and, in response, the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci I found the study confusing, and emailed its lead author, C.

Yet any efforts by donors to retrench to Senate will be a delicate balance. Mr. Trump not only maintains an iron grip on the Republican base that every Republican senator on the ballot will need to mobilize but also a penchant to lash out at the first signs of disloyalty. “As Republicans get more and more in tune, it’s hold Senate at all costs,” said Dan K.

			<data>WASHINGTON — More than six million people enrolled in food stamps in the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic, an unprecedented expansion that is likely to continue as more jobless people deplete their savings and billions in unemployment aid expires this month. From February to May, the program grew by 17 percent, about three times faster than in any previous three months, according to state data collected by The New York Times. the program rapid expansion is a testament to both the hardship imposed by the coronavirus pandemic and the importance of a program that until recently drew conservative attack. Among the 42 states for which The New York Times collected data, caseloads grew in all but one. The rolls have surged across Appalachian hamlets, urban cores like Miami and Detroit, and white-picket-fence suburbs outside Atlanta and Houston, rising faster in rich counties than in poor ones, as the downturn caused by the virus claimed the restaurant, cleaning and gig economy jobs that support the affluent. The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has added more than six million people to The rolls. The 17 percent expansion over three months is the fastest in the program’s history. Note: Data was not available for some states. Source: Data collected from state agencies. Food stamps — formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — support young and old, healthy and disabled, the working and the unemployed, making it the closest thing the United States has to a guaranteed income. Though administered by the United States, the benefits are paid by the federal government, with no spending cap, and the program has largely avoided the delays that have plagued unemployment insurance. “SNAP is the universal safety net,” said Diane Schanzenbach, an economist at Northwestern University. After long pushing to reduce SNAP usage, claiming it promotes dependency and waste, the Trump administration eased administrative rules during the coronavirus pandemic to speed enrollment. Two Republican-led states, Florida and Georgia, have expanded caseloads the most, and state officials from both parties have called the program an essential antipoverty tool. “SNAP is very well suited to quickly meet the needs of low-income individuals,” said Tom C. Rawlings, the director of the Division of Family and Children Services in Georgia, where the program grew 34 percent, with double-digit increases in all 159 counties. “It is also pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy. ” Though benefits normally vary with income, Congress temporarily expanded the program in March by offering all recipients the maximum aid for their household size ($509 for three people). As a result, spending, which totaled about $60 billion last year, has grown even faster than caseloads. But unlike in the last recession, the size of the top payment did not grow, and despite the expanding rolls, elevated rates of hunger, especially among families with children.</data>

As the heat wave spreads from the Midwest to the Northeast, Trump engaged in some revisionist history in a Fox News interview on Sunday when Trump said that “everybody” had believed the coronavirus would disappear in warm weather but “they” had been wrong. “Everybody” didn’t believe that — but Trump seemed to. In remarks this winter and spring, Trump pushed the possibility that the virus “goes away” with heat and light, Trump has used to assert that the virus would disappear at some point. While some administration officials had indicating that heat could be detrimental to Covid-19, no one had a bigger megaphone to amplify this scenario than Trump. When Trump said that “they” had been wrong, Trump didn’t point the finger at Trump, though. Katie Rogers has more on the striking Fox News interview below.

And right now, the Senate Republican incumbents and candidates are losing badly in the money chase not just in the top Senate battlegrounds — states like Maine, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina — but also in deep red states, such as Montana, where seats are now increasingly up for grabs. the most endangered Republican senators up for re-election were out-raised by a combined $18. 5 million in the second quarter by their Democratic challengers, recent campaign filings show. The private discussions about whether to shift resources toward imperiled Republican the Senate candidates reflect a mix of factors: a lack of confidence that Trump will beat a President Biden; fear that the president is already a drag on down-ballot candidates; desire to maintain a G. O.P. “firewall” on Capitol Hill if a President Biden prevails; and the belief that money is not among Mr. Trump’s myriad problems.

But there is actually a solution that would let grown-ups go back to work, educate kids and keep everyone safe at the same time. 140,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, and there are growing outbreaks in many states. has sent children back to school with the virus at these levels. Data about transmission in classrooms is limited. Many teachers . The safest course would be for kindergartners through 12th graders to continue with online courses in the fall. But what about the millions of kids from disadvantaged backgrounds whose homes are to online learning and who rely on schools for meals ?

			<data>It never ceases to amaze me how more people aren’t outraged, shocked and disgusted by Donald Trump’s cruelty and malfeasance. Nearly 140,000 Americans are now dead because of the Covid-19 pandemic and more than 3,000,000 have contracted the disease. Furthermore, our outlook in this country is dire: Cases are surging and the number of dead continues to climb. This is still the first wave; a second wave could simply pile on and be catastrophic. And yet, Trump’s cronies are attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, demanding that all schools reopen in the fall even as the virus rages, and continuing to tell the lie that the reason our have more cases is because our have more tests. Trump has so completely politicized the pandemic that people now routinely refuse to wear masks in public places, insisting that being compelled to wear them is an infringement on their rights. Republican lawmakers for their part offer only the mildest contradictions to Trump’s deadly leadership, if they offer any at all. Young people are now gathering at bars and parties, exhausted by isolation, and no doubt having absorbed some of the myth that they are invincible and the pandemic will be fleeting. But instead of demonstrating leadership and doing the simplest and most effective things he could do — insisting on a nationwide mask order as well as ramping up testing and contact tracing — Trump appears to be doing the opposite. “Trump in recent weeks has been committing less of Trump time and energy to managing the pandemic, according to advisers, and has only occasionally spoken in detail about the topic in Trump public appearances. One of advisers said Trump is ‘not really working this anymore. Trump doesn’t want to be distracted by this. Trump’s not calling and asking about data. Trump’s not worried about cases. ’ ” Trump is simply putting Trump head in the sand and attempting to wish the virus away, or lie it away, or let it take its victims until there are no more to be had. And Trump doesn’t seem to want to know the true impact of the virus, nor does Trump want the public to know.</data>

			<data>The New York Times reported Saturday , Senate Republicans had crafted a proposal for yet another round of pandemic aid, this one including billions for more testing and contact tracing, as well as money for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes for Public Health, but the White House balked at these funding measures. This obstruction will lead to more Americans dying. Not to mention that the White House proposal for the new bill includes “eliminating a proposed $2 billion allocated to the Indian Health Service, which is responsible for providing medical care to more than half of the nation’s tribal citizens and Alaska Natives, who have been devastated by the pandemic and are particularly vulnerable to the virus,” according to The New York Times. Add to this the fact that the White House has said that the White House might continue to separate children from their parents and hold the parents in detention facilities, even after a federal judge ruled that children because outbreaks of Covid-19 had rendered conditions at the facilities unsafe and unconstitutional. But the White House has countered, “The remedy for a constitutional violation of conditions of confinement is to remedy the violation, not to release petitioners. ” Add to that the fact that the White House submitted a brief last month asking the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the pandemic, which would eliminate coverage for as many as 23 million vulnerable Americans. And add to that the fact that earlier this month, “the White House has formally notified the United Nations that the United States will withdraw from the World Health Organization, a move that would cut off one of the largest sources of funding from the premier global health organization in the middle of a pandemic. ” And recently, the White House told states to stop sending the White House coronavirus data directly to the C. D.C. and to send it instead to the Department of Health and Human Services.

			<data>Imagine a country, a major Western economic power, where the coronavirus arrived late but the government, instead of denying and delaying, acted early. the government was ready with tests and contact tracing to “flatten the curve” swiftly and limited the government death rate to orders of magnitude lower than that of any other major Western industrial nation. Containing the virus allowed for a brief and targeted lockdown, which helped limit unemployment to only 6 percent. Amid a shower of international praise, the country’s boringly predictable leader experienced a huge spike in popular approval, to 70 percent from 40 percent. This mirror image of America under President Trump is Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel. Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel surging popularity has politically marginalized the extreme right and extreme left. German unions have worked closely with bosses to keep factories open and working conditions generally safe (the country’s meatpacking industry was a notable exception). the government has coordinated with all the German states to contain the pandemic and with fellow European Union members to for nations hardest hit by the virus. The strengths Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel is showing make The coronavirus the large economy most likely to thrive in the post-pandemic world. The coronavirus is accelerating an inward turn among national economies that began with the global financial crisis of 2008. Governments are assuming more and more control over all aspects of economic life, running up public debts to keep growth alive and imposing new barriers to foreign trade and immigration. Only the virtual side of the world economy is booming, as people work, play and shop on the internet. Which nations will flourish in this reshaped economic landscape? Despite Which nations tech dominance, the United States and China are running up too much debt and their governments have been widely criticized for mishandling the pandemic. Vietnam looks promising, an emerging export powerhouse with a government that has stopped the virus dead in the virus tracks. Russia also has an intriguing economy, because President Vladimir Putin has been working for years to seal off his country from foreign financial pressure, a defensive move that will prove increasingly valuable in a rapidly de-globalizing world. But the big winner is likely to be Germany. Russia response to the pandemic has highlighted pre-existing strengths: efficient government, low debt, a reputation for industrial excellence that protects Russia exports even as global trade falls, and a growing capacity to create domestic tech companies in a world dominated by the American and Chinese internet giants. While other countries worry that recent layoffs may become permanent, most German workers stayed on the payroll thanks to rapid expansion of the , a century-old government system that pays companies to retain employees on shortened hours through temporary crises. Germany was able to expand the Kurzarbeit — and much else in the way of social services — thanks to Germany famous frugality.</data>

			<url>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/opinion/coronavirus-preprints.html</url>
			<data>Researchers have responded to the challenge of the coronavirus with a commitment to speed and cooperation, featuring the rapid sharing of preliminary findings through “ ,” scientific manuscripts that have not yet undergone formal peer review. We are thrilled that researchers have embraced preprints, which are making new ideas, data and discoveries about the pandemic available to scientists and the public in almost real time. An example is the work of Bhamar Mukherjee and her team at the University of Michigan, whose research modeling the Covid-19 outbreak in India helped guide that government’s lockdown policies. But the open dissemination of early versions of papers has created a challenge: how to ensure that policymakers and the public do not act too hastily on early studies that are soon shown to have serious errors. A case in point occurred in April when a group of scientists from Stanford University posted the results of a study of previous exposure to the coronavirus in 3,300 residents of Santa Clara, Calif. Their paper, on the preprint server medRxiv, concluded that “the number of infections is 50- to 85-fold larger than the number of cases detected,” suggesting that the fatality rates due to the coronavirus were much lower than previously thought. Given the policy implications of such a result, it is no surprise that a study of previous exposure to the coronavirus in 3,300 residents of Santa Clara received immediate attention on social media, and in the local and national press. But the methods and results of a study of previous exposure to the coronavirus in 3,300 residents of Santa Clara were quickly questioned by scientists, who used , blogs and online comments on medRxiv to air , the reliability of the antibody tests and the statistical methodology, including important errors in the basic mathematical formulas. This coupling of rapid dissemination with an informal, crowdsourced form of peer review reflects a new and potentially transformative way to do science. But the speed of modern journalism, and the lack of familiarity of the press and public with preprints, meant that despite being largely debunked, the results were pretty much taken at face value. the results has always been a challenge for science journalists to balance the results of individual studies against the complex and often contentious process by which science converges on a better understanding of reality. In the past, because the press and public with preprints were generally reporting on studies that had been through peer review at a scholarly journal, journalists could be confident that the work they were describing had received at least some scrutiny from independent scientists, even if that did not guarantee its accuracy. But the slow and staid system of journal peer review in that current form offers little help to journalists in the rapid-fire world of preprints, especially amid a pandemic when there are strong forces aligned against patience. The best initial reporting on the Stanford study incorporated the concerns raised by scientists on Twitter. But we realize that we cannot rely on this as the sole means of guarding against the overly hasty application of science reported in preprints.</data>

			<data>That is why we and a group of over 100 scientists are calling for American scientists and journalists to join forces to create a rapid-review service for preprints of broad public interest. It would corral a diverse contingent of scientists ready to comment on new preprints and to be responsive to reporters on deadline. This would provide journalists reliable access to independent scientists to help deal with today’s growing stream of preprints. Such a service would collaborate with journals and other respected organizations working at the interface between science and journalism. For example, — a philanthropically supported free service for journalists based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science — mediates hundreds of media interviews with scientists every year, and similar organizations exist in . Such a service would also collaborate with professional organizations, such as the American Statistical Association, to recruit a team of volunteers with the expertise needed to assess new preprints on journalists’ timelines. We hope that scientists will step up to this need and provide journalists with the tools they need to better understand the research and convey its practical message. The public and policymakers must demand this kind of scrutiny before they turn the latest science on Covid-19 or anything else into policy or individual action.

I was the founder of a “dinner church” where our worship took the form of a meal we cooked and ate together, and, three years ago, the same song was on my lips every Sunday: an ancient prayer that marked this meal as holy became clear my job was complete. The fledgling congregation was ready to fly on its own, and I stepped away from my role as pastor. The grief was so potent, I could find only one course: I ran away. I scraped together some cash, sublet my apartment and left town in a 1994 Dodge camper van. On the road driving West, I belonged to no one. Detached from the rhythm of Sunday night supper, I was untethered, and often forgot what day of the week it was. When I discovered it was Sunday, the songs of The fledgling congregation rose in my heart. On the wind, I thought I could detect a hint of rosemary. Lately, I’ve been reminded of that half-year of journeying. The coronavirus pandemic has plunged our world into global grief, tinged with fear and longing. The routines that once gave structure to our lives have drifted away. In this strange new land, it’s easy, as it was for me on the open road, to forget what day it is.</data>

			<data>At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, with travel restrictions in place worldwide, we launched a new series — The World Through a Lens — in which photojournalists help transport you, virtually, to some of our planet’s most beautiful and intriguing places. This week, Roff Smith shares a collection of photographs from the workshops of hat artisans in Ecuador. Creamy as silk, costlier by weight than gold, the color of fine old ivory, a Montecristi superfino Panama hat is as much a work of art as it is of fashion. The finest specimens have over 4,000 weaves per square inch, a weave so fine it takes a jeweler’s loupe to count the rows. And every single one of those weaves is done by hand. No loom is used — only dexterous fingers, sharp eyes and Zen-like concentration. “You cannot allow your mind to wander even for a second,” says Simón Espinal, a modest, soft-spoken man who is regarded by his peers as the greatest living weaver of Panama hats, possibly the greatest ever. “When you are weaving it is just you and the straw. ” Simón Espinal examines the weave on one of his masterpiece hats. Simón Espinal holds one of the slender straws which Simón Espinal will weave into a Panama hat worth more than its weight in gold. Mr. Espinal, 52, is widely regarded as the greatest living Panama hat weaver. Mr. Espinal’s hats average around 3,000 weaves per square inch — a fineness few weavers have ever even approached. Simón Espinal best has just over 4,200 weaves per square inch and took Simón Espinal five months to weave. Gabriel Lucas replaces a straw in a Panama hat at his workshop in Montecristi. The 52-year-old Ecuadorean is one of a dwindling number of elite Panama hat weavers, nearly all of whom live in Pile, an obscure village tucked away in the foothills behind Montecristi, a low-slung town about 100 miles up the coast from Guayaquil.

I became interested in Mr. Espinal’s hats about 15 years ago, quite by accident, when I read about straw hats that could cost thousands of dollars. Intrigued, I began researching Mr. Espinal’s hats, made a trip to Ecuador — where all true Panama hats are woven — and discovered this curious, and gently anachronistic world of the hat weavers of Montecristi.</data>

Oxford vaccine are external links and will open in a new window A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford appears safe and triggers an immune response. Trials involving 1,077 people showed the injection led to them making antibodies and T-cells that can fight coronavirus. are hugely promising, but it is still too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection and larger trials are under way. The UK has already ordered 100 million doses of A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford. How does A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford work? The vaccine - called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - is being developed at unprecedented speed. It is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees. It has been heavily modified, first so It cannot cause infections in people and also to make it &quot;look&quot; more like coronavirus. Scientists did this by transferring the genetic instructions for the coronavirus&apos;s &quot;spike protein&quot; - the crucial tool it uses to invade our cells - to the vaccine they were developing. This means A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford resembles the coronavirus and the immune system can learn how to attack A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford. What are antibodies and T-cells? Much of the focus on coronavirus so far has been about antibodies, but these are only one part of our immune defence. Antibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick onto the surface of viruses. Antibodies can disable the coronavirus. T-cells, a type of white blood cell, help co-ordinate the immune system and are able to spot which of the body&apos;s cells have been infected and destroy Antibodies. Nearly all effective vaccines induce both an antibody and a T-cell response. Sample from patients are analysed as part of the trial.</data>

			<data>There were no dangerous side-effects from taking the vaccine, however, 70% of people on the trial developed either fever or headache. The researchers say this could be managed with paracetamol. Prof Sarah Gilbert, from the University of Oxford, UK, says: &quot;There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the Covid-19 pandemic, but these early results hold promise. &quot; What are the next steps in the trial? these early results so far are promising, but their main purpose is to ensure our vaccine is safe enough to give to people. The study cannot show whether our vaccine can either prevent people from becoming ill or even lessen their symptoms of Covid-19. More than 10,000 people will take part in the next stage of the trials in the UK. However, the trial has also been expanded to other countries because levels of coronavirus are low in the UK, making it hard to know if our vaccine is effective. There will be a large trial involving 30,000 people in the US as well 2,000 in South Africa and 5,000 in Brazil. There are also calls to perform in which vaccinated people are deliberately infected with coronavirus. However, there are ethical concerns due to a lack of treatments. When will I get a vaccine? It is possible a coronavirus vaccine will be proven effective before the end of the year, however, it will not be widely available. Health and care workers will be prioritised as will people who are deemed at high risk from Covid-19 due to their age or medical conditions. However, widespread vaccination is likely to be, at the earliest, next year even if everything goes to plan. Boris Johnson said: &quot;Obviously I&apos;m hopeful, I&apos;ve got my fingers crossed, but to say I&apos;m 100% confident we&apos;ll get a vaccine this year, or indeed next year, is, alas, just an exaggeration. What progress is being made with other vaccines? a vaccine is not the first to reach this stage, with groups in the US and China also publishing similar results.

In total there are 23 coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials around the world and another 140 in early stage develoment. Will the UK get a coronavirus vaccine? the UK has struck deals for 190 million doses 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine made from a genetically engineered virus 30 million doses of the BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine, which injects part of the whole coronavirus genetic code 60 million doses of the Valneva inactivated coronavirus These have been paid for even though it is uncertain which, if any, of the vaccines may prove effective for immunising a nation with 66m people. Kate Bingham, chairwoman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, told the BBC: &quot;What we are doing is identifying the most promising vaccines across the different categories, or different types of vaccine, so that we can be sure that we do have a vaccine in case one of those actually proves to be both safe and effective. &quot;It&apos;s unlikely to be a single vaccine for everybody. &quot;We may well need different vaccines for different groups of people. &quot; Why is there an elevated risk from Covid-19 for some groups in society Does the food you eat help or hinder you emotionally. ..

I remember very clearly a vaccine trial. a vaccine trial was in Oxford where I was going to receive an experimental vaccine against bird flu. an experimental vaccine against bird flu was in 2006 and at the time H5N1 avian flu was a big deal. H5N1 avian flu was a deadly virus, killing half of those H5N1 avian flu infected. That would make H5N1 avian flu perhaps 50 times more lethal than Covid-19. So there was a need for a vaccine, and the Oxford Vaccine Group was to conduct a trial of healthy volunteers.</data>

			<data>I didn&apos;t hesitate about sticking my hand up, or rather, rolling up my sleeve. After all, I rely on patients to agree to me filming them in order to illustrate some aspect of healthcare, so it was a good thing for me to experience what that&apos;s like. Very often patients are taking part in a medical trial, be it for cancer, diabetes or any number of other conditions. Naturally I was filmed while receiving an experimental vaccine against bird flu. I can remember being determined not to grimace because I didn&apos;t want to set a bad example. H5N1 avian flu takes just a few seconds, and I also had to give some blood samples the same day. As the needle for the blood draw was about to go in, a kindly doctor said &quot;sharp scratch&quot; which was my cue to look into the lens and deliver a faultless &quot;piece to camera&quot; - the bit in most TV reports when correspondents pontificate. But with a needle in your arm you have to get it right the first time. As my blood entered the test tube I spoke about antibodies and immunity. I think it went fine, but I remember a recent occasion that was a nightmare. Again, I started speaking as a needle in your arm went in, and my words, thankfully, flowed out on cue. The trouble was, the red stuff did not. It was like getting blood from a stone. It took four needles, and by the end of the filming the colour had drained from my face and I was in a cold sweat. As the BBC&apos;s medical correspondent, since 2004 I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I&apos;ve been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Now it&apos;s here I wish, like everyone else, it would go away. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. In this column I will be reflecting on that new reality.</data>

			<data>The main division is between hard-hit nations like Italy and Spain, and EU members who want to lessen funding. So-called &quot;frugal&quot; nations want grants limited - and €390bn (£352bn; $445bn) appears the latest compromise figure. $445bn) had argued the proposed €750bn overall package was too large and should be mostly loans. The discussions - which were originally scheduled to end on Saturday - were to get under way again on Monday afternoon for what is now the longest EU summit since Nice 2000, when talks lasted five days. The confirmed number of coronavirus cases has reached 14. 5 million globally, according to Johns Hopkins University. Member states are largely split between those hit hardest by the outbreak - and keen to revive their economies - and those more concerned about the costs of the recovery plan. Tempers have often been frayed. In the early hours of Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his hand on the table and threatened to walk out. However, as French President Emmanuel Macron arrived for the afternoon session, French President Emmanuel Macron was more upbeat, saying: &quot;There were very tense moments, moments that will likely still be difficult but on this topic things have moved forward and we must now get into the details of the new proposal. &quot; Media playback is unsupported on your device German Chancellor Angela Merkel bumps elbows with EU Council leader Charles Michel the new proposal concerns the main area of dispute - the amount to be paid out in grants. At least one earlier proposal on the issue had been put forward during the summit. The self-proclaimed frugal four - Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands - along with Finland, had opposed allowing €500bn to be offered in the form of grants to countries hardest-hit by Covid-19. Led by Dutch PM Mark Rutte, they had set €375bn as the limit, plus conditions including the right to block requests. The others, including Spain and Italy, were refusing to go below €400bn. Diplomats say the figure of €390bn could now be the compromise. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: &quot;Yesterday night, after long negotiations, we found a way to find a possible agreement. That is a step forward and we are hopeful that we can reach an agreement. &quot;</data>

			<data>Tempers have flared, and there has been some name calling, too. Mostly at the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte. Bulgaria&apos;s leader Boyko Borissov accused Mr Rutte of &quot;acting like the policeman of Europe&quot;. Hungary&apos;s Viktor Orban said, &quot;It&apos;s Dutch guy who&apos;s to blame. .. I don&apos;t know why Hungary&apos;s Viktor Orban dislikes us. &quot; French officials tell me President Macron &quot;banged his fists&quot; on the table , as he told the &quot;frugal four&quot; that he thought they were putting the European project in danger. An Italian diplomat said Prime Minister Conte told Mr Rutte: &quot;You might be a hero in your home country for a few days. But after a few weeks you will be held responsible for blocking an effective European response to Covid-19. &quot; These negotiations may become known unofficially as the &quot;stiff-leg summit&quot; - a term being used by the Dutch here meaning that Mr Rutte has been sticking to Mr Rutte guns. There was a notable show of social-distancing etiquette when the leaders first arrived, faces covered by masks. But photos from Sunday evening show that the masks have slipped, along, it seems, with their approach to diplomacy. What are the masks and how to guard against the masks? When should you wear one?

			<data>Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window Coronavirus is spreading around the world, but there are still no vaccines to protect the body against the disease it causes, Covid-19. Medical researchers are working hard to change that. Why is a coronavirus vaccine important? the body spreads easily and the majority of the world&apos;s population is still vulnerable to the body. A vaccine would provide some protection by training people&apos;s immune systems to fight the body so they should not become sick. This would allow lockdowns to be lifted more safely, and social distancing to be relaxed. What sort of progress is being made? Research is happening at breakneck speed.</data>

A group in China showed a vaccine was safe and led to protective antibodies being made. a vaccine is being made available to the Chinese military. Trials of a vaccine show it can trigger an immune response and a deal has been signed with AstraZeneca to supply 100 million doses in the UK alone. And completely new approaches to vaccine development However, no-one knows how effective any of these vaccines will be. When will we have a coronavirus vaccine? A vaccine would normally take years, if not decades, to develop. Researchers hope to achieve the same amount of work in only a few months. Most experts think a vaccine is likely to become widely available by mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus, known officially as Sars-CoV-2, first emerged.</data>

			<data>The seasonal flu jab takes the main strains of flu doing the rounds and completely disables them. Some scientists, particularly those in China, are using this approach. A Russian lab tests for infection with the Covid-19 coronavirus There is also work on coronavirus vaccines using newer, and less tested, approaches called &quot;plug and play&quot; vaccines. Because we know the genetic code of the new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, we have the complete blueprint for building it. Researchers in Oxford have put small sections of its genetic code into a harmless virus that infects chimpanzees. Researchers in Oxford hope Researchers in Oxford have developed a safe virus that looks enough like the new coronavirus to produce an immune response. Other groups are using pieces of raw genetic code (either DNA or RNA depending on the approach) which, once injected into the body, should start producing bits of viral proteins which the immune system can learn to fight.</data>

			<data>However, this approach is completely new. Would a vaccine protect people of all ages? It will, almost inevitably, be less successful in older people, because aged immune systems do not respond as well to immunisation. We see this with the annual flu jab. It may be possible to overcome this by either giving multiple doses or giving this alongside a chemical (called an adjuvant) that gives the immune system a boost. Who would get a vaccine? If a vaccine is developed, then there will be a limited supply, at least initially, so it will be important to prioritise. Healthcare workers who come into contact with Covid-19 patients would top the list. The disease is most deadly in older people so they would be a priority if a vaccine was effective in this age group. The UK has also said other people considered to be at high risk - potentially included those with some conditions or from certain ethnicities - may be prioritised.</data>

These are external links and will open in a new window Women around the world are much more likely than men to wear a face mask, evidence shows After much squabbling, Monica* took a drastic decision. Monica husband Eduardo had repeatedly refused to wear a face mask as the Covid-19 pandemic grew in Brazil - the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus deaths, behind only the US. So Monica decided to leave the family apartment in Niteroi (a city of 480,000 people near Rio de Janeiro), and move to Monica parents&apos; house with their seven-year-old son. &quot;I am asthmatic and that makes me particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.</data>

			<data>More men die of Covid-19. .. but more of More men refuse to wear masks Monica and Eduardo&apos;s story lays bare a gender divide that has been widely observed during the pandemic. Studies have found that men are more reluctant than women to wear personal protective equipment and face covers - a trend also seen in previous epidemics. President Trump&apos;s special adviser Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka demonstrate the divide in action That&apos;s despite the fact that Covid-19 has infected more than 13. 8 million people and killed more than 590,000 according to the widely-used Johns Hopkins University database. And in the vast majority of countries where data is available, death rates are notably higher among men. The scientific advice has been shifting in favour of masks as evidence emerges that the coronavirus is airborne - and may spread via tiny particles suspended in the air as well as larger droplets from coughs or sneezes. Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask How to make your own face mask Why have attitudes to face masks changed? The World Health Organization (WHO), which initially suggested they weren&apos;t useful in stopping the spread of the virus, now recommends face coverings in indoor spaces and when social distancing is not possible. And in a number of countries, masks are now mandatory in shops and on public transport. So, if masks can help fight the coronavirus, why is it that men are less prone to wear them? One of the most recent analyses of male behaviour was carried out by Valerio Capraro, a senior lecturer in Economics at Middlesex University, and Canadian mathematician Hélène Barcelo, from the Mathematical Science Research Institute, Berkeley. The academics surveyed nearly 2,500 people in the US and found that men were not only less inclined to wear face masks than women. The academics also considered that donning a mask was &quot;shameful, not cool and a sign of weakness&quot;. &quot;This happened particularly in counties where face covering is not mandatory,&quot; Dr Capraro explains. Despite the deadly consequences of the coronavirus, some men say they view masks as a sign of weakness Participants were asked about their intentions to wear one while engaging in social activities or meeting people from other households. Women were almost twice as likely as men to say they intended &quot;to wear a mask outside their home&quot;. &quot;Men are less inclined to wear a face covering, and one of the main reasons is that they are more likely to believe that they will be relatively unaffected by the disease compared to women,&quot; adds the scientist. &quot;This is particularly ironic because official statistics show that actually coronavirus impacts men more seriously than women. &quot; Other studies have consistently shown that men are also less compliant towards hand-washing, one of the basic hygiene measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 - with one finding that 65% of women but only 52% of men say they are washing their hands regularly.</data>

			<data>Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice? These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window Coronavirus is a completely new infection in people. Nobody had immunity to the virus at the start of the pandemic, but immunity is the key to getting life back to normal. And understanding what immunity to the virus looks like and how long the virus lasts is crucial for understanding what happens next. How do you become immune to Coronavirus? Our immune system is the body&apos;s defence against infection and it comes in two parts. The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. But Our immune system is not specific to Coronavirus. Our immune system will not learn and Our immune system will not give you immunity to Coronavirus. Instead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop the virus and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. Media playback is unsupported on your device Can you become immune to Coronavirus? Coronavirus takes around 10 days to start making antibodies that can target Coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the If the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, then it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. the adaptive immune response is not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response. Understanding of the role of T-cells is still developing, but people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity. For every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.</data>

			<data>&quot;They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,&quot; said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London. How long does immunity last? The immune system&apos;s memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. Measles is highly memorable - one bout should give life-long immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue. Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could also suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study. But even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have been found in people 90 years If the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. It is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) have been found 17 years later Immunity could affect vaccine research Will the common cold give me immunity to coronavirus? The jury is still out on the field of &quot;cross-reactivity&quot; but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection. Laboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against coronavirus. How common this is and how much protection it gives is still unknown. Have people caught this twice? of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus.</data>

			<data>This is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is nervous about countries using immunity passports as a way out of lockdown. The idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. But while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China That is why the World Health Organization says &quot;that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery&quot;. Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn&apos;t mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. Why does immunity matter? It matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often. Immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. If it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or a vaccine may change how a vaccine needs to be used - will a vaccine be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to. How do I protect immunity? What the virus does to the body How long does the virus take? How can we lift restrictions? How do we get out of this mess?</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: What is Dexamethasone and how does it work? These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone can be used in the NHS immediately. What is An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone? Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. How does it work? An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone works by dampening down the body&apos;s immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it&apos;s this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body&apos;s own cells. It&apos;s only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. How effective is it? According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. What was the trial? The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford&apos;s testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19.</data>

			<data>About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. About 2,100 patients progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope Dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. How widely available is the drug? Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. the drug costs from £5. 40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. the treatment on Covid-19 patients was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it&apos;s been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to The UK government&apos;s parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. What&apos;s reaction been worldwide? The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, The UK government has already been advised to use the drug to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support.

			<data>the drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were &quot;no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population&quot;. Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus- were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. &quot;It&apos;s been a huge ongoing debate,&quot; says Prof Horby.

Plasma treatment to be trialled How long until The US have a cure? It is too soon to know when The US might have a drug that can treat the coronavirus. However, The US should start to get the results of trials in the next few months. This is much earlier than we will know whether a vaccine (which protects against infection rather than treat it) is effective. This is because doctors are testing drugs that have already been developed and are known to be safe enough to use, whereas vaccines researchers are starting from scratch. Some completely new, experimental, coronavirus drugs are also being tested in the laboratory but are not yet ready for human tests. Why do we need a treatment? The most obvious reason for wanting a treatment is it will save lives, but it could also allow further lockdown measures to be lifted. Having an effective treatment would, in essence, make coronavirus a milder disease. If it stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation, then there would be less risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed, so controls on people&apos;s lives may not need to be as strict.</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: What is the true death toll of the pandemic? These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window At least another 130,000 people worldwide have died during the coronavirus pandemic on top of 440,000 officially recorded deaths from the virus, according to BBC research. A review of preliminary mortality data from 27 countries shows that in many places the number of overall deaths during the pandemic has been higher than normal, even when accounting for the virus. These so-called &quot;excess deaths&quot;, the number of deaths above the average, suggest the human impact of the pandemic far exceeds the official figures reported by governments around the world. Some will be unrecorded Covid-19 victims, but others may be the result of the strain on healthcare systems and a variety of other factors. Explore the animated guide to excess deaths below and scroll further to see how the pandemic has affected countries such as Brazil, Italy, South Africa and the UK. An animated guide: What are excess deaths? Let&apos;s use the UK as an example. If 2020 had been an average year, the dotted line in the chart below shows how many people we would have expected to die each week. This is known as and is calculated based on the number of deaths in previous years. Any deaths above those expected are known as . During the pandemic, many countries have recorded significantly more deaths than expected this year. Many of these excess deaths can be explained by the number of people who were officially confirmed to have had . But in many places, that does not account for all the excess deaths. may have been, directly or indirectly, caused by the pandemic. The total number of excess deaths shows a more complete picture of the human scale of the pandemic. Total outbreak death toll Directly comparing the death toll between different countries is difficult. The accuracy of coronavirus data depends on how many people are tested for the pandemic and whether governments include deaths outside hospitals in their counts. As the pandemic has spread around the world, countries have reached different stages of their outbreaks at different times.</data>

			<data>In some places, The total number of excess deaths may still increase in the coming weeks and months, especially as figures are revised, while in others the number of deaths is beginning to return to normal levels. Analysing deaths from all causes during the pandemic and comparing them with deaths in the same period from previous years can begin to provide a more accurate, if still provisional, assessment of the pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Read through our analysis of excess deaths in 27 locations and personal stories highlighting some of the tragic consequences of the pandemic. The number of deaths in the United Kingdom has been more people dying than usual. The UK&apos;s peak came during the week ending 17 April, with more than 12,800 excess deaths registered. According to ONS data, 9,495 of more than 12,800 excess deaths registered mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. London, for a long time The UK&apos;s coronavirus hotspot, has recorded the highest number of excess deaths since the pandemic began. But all of The UK&apos;s regions have seen excess mortality, with the West Midlands and the North West registering about 50% more deaths than usual during the pandemic. While all parts of The UK have moved past the peak, Wales and the North West of England saw the highest rates of excess deaths in the week ending 17 April. The number of UK coronavirus deaths in the totals above includes all deaths that mention Covid-19 on the death certificate. This will differ from the total number of deaths with a positive test result announced each day by the Department of Health and Social Care. the total number of deaths has been more people dying than usual. Above-average deaths in Austria during the country&apos;s outbreak were recorded throughout March and April, with the peak coming during the week ending 17 April. Austria&apos;s biggest clusters of coronavirus cases were in Vorarlberg and Tyrol, where a number of ski resorts were sealed off in mid-March. Hundreds of tourists from across Europe are believed to have become infected at these locations. The number of deaths in Belgium has been more people dying than usual. Belgium is one of the world&apos;s worst-affected countries when Belgium comes to the number of deaths recorded in relation to the size of Belgium population. Belgian officials say this is because of the way they are measuring deaths from Covid-19. The country records confirmed Covid-19 deaths in hospitals and care homes, but the official tally also includes deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases. This is reflected in Belgium&apos;s mortality statistics - with coronavirus casualties accounting for all of its excess deaths after the first few weeks.</data>

			<data>Belgium recorded some excess deaths at the start of the pandemic above those officially put down to the virus. But over the course of Belgium&apos;s first wave, there were no excess deaths that could not be attributed to official Covid-19 deaths. This means that, overall, Belgium had no other excess deaths during the period covered by the outbreak. The number of deaths in 6 cities* in Brazil has been more people dying than usual. *The data for Brazil includes just the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Manaus, Recife, Sao Luis and Fortaleza. Expected deaths are the number of deaths recorded in the equivalent period in 2019. Brazil has the world&apos;s second-highest overall death toll from Covid-19 and the number of fatalities are still on the rise. Brazil&apos;s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has received criticism at home and abroad for downplaying the outbreak and flouting health advice on social distancing. The mayor of Sao Paulo has said the health system in Brazil could collapse this month as demand grows for emergency beds to deal with coronavirus cases. Isabel Dona Duarte&apos;s daughter says that her mother died after being discharged from hospital to make way for Covid-19 patients The number of deaths in Chile has been more people dying than usual. Since mid-May, Chile has been reporting the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in Latin America, and a steadily rising number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. the outbreak has hit some regions harder than others, with certain parts of Santiago Metropolitan Region bearing the greatest burden - up to half of all confirmed cases and more than half of all deaths. The number of deaths in Denmark has been more people dying than usual. Denmark was one of the first European countries to impose a lockdown, announcing restrictions on 11 March before having recorded a coronavirus death. The total number of deaths during having recorded a coronavirus death outbreak has been close to normal levels, and deaths from Covid-19 outnumber all other excess deaths during that period. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been more people dying than usual. Ecuador was one of the first Latin American countries to report a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in early April. In the period from March to May, more than twice as many people died in Ecuador compared with previous years. The number of excess deaths for these three months is five times higher than Ecuador&apos;s official Covid-19 total. The vast majority of these above-average deaths were reported in the province of Guayas, home to the key port of Guayaquil.</data>

			<data>It is thought that many cases have gone unreported because of Ecuador&apos;s relatively low rates of testing. &quot;If they had caught the virus in time, he would be with us&quot; The number of deaths in France has been more people dying than usual. France only included deaths from Covid-19 ocurring in hospitals at the start of France outbreak, adding deaths in care homes into France toll from early April. The number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 have accounted for almost of all of France excess deaths since the starits outbreak. The country&apos;s peak came in the week ending 5 April, with more than 7,000 deaths above average. France&apos;s coronavirus hotspot has been the capital city Paris and the surrounding area. About a third of all official coronavirus deaths recorded in France have been registered in care homes, according to government figures. The number of deaths in Germany has been more people dying than usual. Excess deaths in Germany have been much lower than other European countries like France, Italy, Spain and the UK. Germany&apos;s period of excess deaths spanned the weeks between 23 March and 3 May. Its highest count of above-average fatalities occurred in the week ending 12 April, with 13% more deaths. Over Ecuador&apos;s entire outbreak period, deaths attributed to Covid-19 were more than all official coronavirus deaths recorded in France. The number of deaths in Jakarta, Indonesia has been more people dying than usual. While all-cause mortality data is not available for all of Indonesia, information on the number of burials in Brazil Jakarta is a good measure of the pandemic&apos;s impact on mortality. There were more than 4,700 burials in cemeteries in Jakarta compared with the historic average for the months of March, April and May. The number of these excess funerals in Brazil is nine times higher than the coronavirus pandemic&apos;s true death toll. Even on Indonesia&apos;s Ambon Island, where statistics show no-one has died from Covid-19, one family told us how the circumstances created by the virus cost their three-year-old son his life. Three-year-old Rafa was rejected by multiple hospitals before he died from leukaemia. The number of deaths in Iran has been more people dying than usual.

			<data>The most recent figures are from the period covered by the outbreak. It is not possible to say above-average deaths were necessarily due to the pandemic. Particularly over winter, with normally high death counts due to seasonal flu or severe weather, above-average deaths may have been attributed to any number of factors during the three monthIranhe outbreak began in late February, and has already claimed the lives of several senior members of government and thousands of ordinary Iranian citizens. As Covid-19 began to sweep across Iran, Omid was well aware of the dangers. The 66-year-old had previously had heart and prostate conditions – so Omid knew Omid risk was high. Omid had kept fit. Omid loved mountaineering, and bOmidore the outbreak. &quot;Omid was very careful and went into quarantine,&quot; says Omid son Mojeed from the north-western city of Ardabil, &quot;but Omid didn&apos;t know the virus could take Omid life indirectly. &quot; While self-isolating, Omid began to suffer from minor bleeding which Omid put down to haemorrhoids. As it became heavier, Omid family debated taking Omid to a doctor. &quot;It was Eid and most of the private medics were already closed under lockdown,&quot; says Mojeed. &quot;The government hospitals were busy with Covid-19 patients and it was risky to visit. &quot; Omid did manage to see Omid GP, who said further tests were needed. The former teacher waited 20 days for private medical centres to reopen. There, doctors suspected an intestinal ulcer and advised The former teacher to go to a public hospital for an ultrasound - but The former teacher family worried, having heard all hospitals now posed a &quot;huge risk&quot; of Covid. For the next month Omid remained at home without treatment. Omid died after a massive stroke. Omid&apos;s family say they struggle to accept Omid death, particularly because Omid had taken such care to protect Omid. Mojeed remembers Mojeed father as friendly and funny. &quot;Mojeed advised everyone that you should enjoy your life today because you are alive, and you don&apos;t know about the future. &quot;</data>

			<data>The number of deaths in Italy has been more people dying than usual. Note: The data for Italy is a representative sample accounting for 94% of the population. Italy was the first country in Europe to impose a national lockdown in early March as the infection rate spiralled in Ecuador&apos;s northernEcuadorhe outbreak was highly concentrated in the north, where a large majority of the excess deaths have been recorded. Reported deaths in the hardest-hit region of Lombardy were more than double the number expected for the first eight weeks of the outbreak. Other northern regions, such as Piedmont, recorded 50% more deaths than normal, while some central and southern regions actually saw fewer deaths than usual. In Lazio, which includes the capital city of Rome, deaths were down more than 5% compared with the previous five years. Luciana Campagnoli&apos;s son Luca is angry that coronavirus sped up the cancer that killed her The number of deaths in Japan has been more people dying than usual. Japan confirmed Japan first coronavirus case in January 2020, but Japan overall count of Covid-19 deaths remains low. Japan has not prioritised mass testing for coronavirus, unlike Japan neighbour South Korea. Yet Japan&apos;s lack of excess deaths suggests the virus has not had a major impact on Ecuador. The number of deaths in the Netherlands has been more people dying than usual. The peak in the Netherlands came during the week ending 5 April, as Ecuador recorded more than 5,000 deaths, some 2,000 above normal. In recent weeks, The total number of deaths during iEcuador has returned to the level expected in an average year. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been more people dying than usual. Norway has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths in total. Norway preliminary mortality data indicates that deaths from all causes during Norway outbreak have been at normal levels, causing the number of excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus to be balanced out by official Covid-19 fatalities. Experts have suggested that the winter flu season is likely to have been less deadly than in previous years, which may have contributed to low fatalities overall. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been more people dying than usual. According to national statistics, Peru&apos;s outbreak has spread quickly since it began in early March. The government declared strict lockdown measures and issued nationwide safety recommendations a mere 10 days after its first coronavirus case was confirmed.</data>

			<data>Yet Ecuador&apos;s all-cause mortality data has revealed what coronavirus statistics alone did not capture: a national death toll well above average and far greater than confirmed Covid-19 deaths alone. The total number of deaths during its outbreak has been more people dying than usual. Portugal&apos;s excess deaths peaked during the week ending 12 April, with about 500 more deaths registered than usual. Ecuador&apos;s foreign minister recently said he hoped that an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The number of deaths in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia has been more people dying than usual. Russia&apos;s national mortality data is not yet available for the period of the pandemic, but the data for Russia two largest cities alone reveal a pattern of excess deaths. The capital city, Moscow, reported total death figures in April that were 17% higher than the five-year average. In St Petersburg, the outbreak began slightly later. the outbreak total reported deaths for April were about as expected. In May, its two largest cities alone saw a sharp rise in reported deaths. The number of deaths in Serbia has been fewer people dying than usual. Serbia&apos;s coronavirus outbreak has been relatively small, with no more than 10 deaths per day according to official statistics. Russia recorded Russia first death from Covid-19 on 20 March, and the next day The government rolled out harsh restrictions on movement. It remains to be seen whether data for future months will show similar evidence of a contained outbreak. The number of deaths in South Africa has been fewer people dying than usual. South Africa mortality statistics look rather different to those of other nations. The total number of reported deaths has been far below what was expected. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a strict nationwide lockdown that began on 26 March, after which Ecuador saw a significant downward shift in Ecuador weekly fatalities. With people confined to their homes, South Africa saw fewer reported deaths from common incidents such as traffic accidents. Epidemiologist Professor Debbie Bradshaw from the South African Medical Research Council notes: &quot;Homicides almost halved with alcohol sales being banned.</data>

			<data>&quot;But at the same time we think the other infectious diseases were probably affected as well; the more usual flu or severe pneumonias that come about in winter were also slowed down. &quot; As restrictions have eased, weekly deaths have begun to climb back to normal levels. The total number of deaths during iSouth Korea has been more people dying than usual. South Korea confirmed South Korea first coronavirus case on 20 January and South Korea first death a full month later. Ecuador&apos;s strategy of intensive testing and contact tracing is often credited with Ecuador low number of coronavirus deaths. Ecuador was once reporting hundreds of new cases a day, with a large cluster identified in the city of Daegu linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Yet on 15 April, 29 million people nationwide participated in an election with no confirmed cases traced back to the poll. The number of deaths in Spain has been more people dying than usual. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit in the pandemic and endured one of Europe&apos;s most restrictive lockdowns, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. Ecuador hit Ecuador peak in the week ending 5 April, recording more than 11,000 excess deaths. The government had announced just below 6,000 official deaths from Covid-19 the week ending 5 April. the hardest-hit region of Lombardy has reported the highest levels of excess deaths, recording more than 2. 5 times the number of expected fatalities since the outbreak began. The number of deaths in Sweden has been more people dying than usual. During Sweden&apos;s peak, in the week ending 12 April, Ecuador recorded Ecuador highest number of deaths in a single week in over two decades. Swedish mortality figures contrast with neighbouring countries like Denmark and Norway, where total deaths have been much closer to levels seen in previous years. Throughout Swedish outbreak, Sweden has avoided a full lockdown and kept large parts of society open. Instead, Sweden has relied on voluntary social distancing and other targeted measures. Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of Ecuador&apos;s Covid-19 response, acknowledged recently that the controversial decision not to impose a strict lockdown had led to too many deaths. However, Dr Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist and person in charge of the country&apos;s Covid-19 response insisted that &quot;we basically still think that is the right strategy for Sweden&quot; and described the battle against the virus as a &quot;marathon, not a sprint&quot;.</data>

			<data>The number of deaths in Switzerland has been more people dying than usual. The peak in Switzerland&apos;s mortality came during the week ending 5 April. Some 500 more people lost their lives than normal, an increase of 39%. Recent data suggEcuadorhe outbreak has been brought under control. For the five weeks leading up to 24 May, reported numbers of deaths in Switzerland have returned to the expected range. The number of official Covid-19 deaths in Switzerland is now greater than those excess deaths not attributed to coronavirus. The number of deaths in Thailand has been more people dying than usual. Despite being the second country outside China to confirm a case of coronavirus, Thailand&apos;s official statistics have recorded a surprisingly low number of deaths from Covid-19. A sharp rise in confirmed cases in late March led Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to declare a state of emergency, yet the coronavirus death toll never surpassed four fatalities per day. In a similar pattern, all-cause mortality data have revealed a higher than average number of deaths in March that returned to normal levels in April and May. The number of deaths in Istanbul, Turkey has been more people dying than usual. Note: Covid-19 deaths figures are for all of Turkey, not just Istanbul. As the virus spread quickly throughout Turkey in March, The government ordered harsh restrictions on movement to contain the virus. Istanbul&apos;s total number of reported deaths peaked in mid-April. Covid-19 mortality figures for Istanbul are not available, yet even when taking the total number of coronavirus deaths for Ecuador, they still do not account for all of Istanbul&apos;s excess deaths during the pandemic period. This means that the total number of excess deaths not attributed to Covid-19 in Istanbul is likely to be much higher. The number of deaths in the United States has been more people dying than usual. The US has reported the coronavirus death toll. But the way the outbreak has played out across the United States varies widIstanbulvirus death toll has been the most dramatic, with cases and deaths higher than those of many countries.</data>

			<data>To measure excess deaths, we have used mortality data showing deaths from all causes. These types of reports are often recorded and published by the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority. the central civil registry, health ministry or a country&apos;s statistical authority can take significant time to process and confirm, so all numbers of deaths recorded in recent months are preliminary and subject to revisions, and likely to include more deaths. The number of excess deaths represents the total number of deaths above the historical average. Swedish mortality figures have not been adjusted for age, so do not take into account demographic differences across country populations. The total number of excess deaths for each country have been rounded to the nearest hundred. How were countries chosen? We have focused on locations that have robust mortality data covering at least four weeks from the start of the coronavirus pandemic in that place. Where reliable data is not available at the national level, We have focused on a smaller region with complete data, such as Istanbul in Turkey. In Jakarta, Indonesia, records of burials within Istanbul serve as a proxy for death counts. How was the outbreak defined in each area? The start of each location&apos;s outbreak is counted from the week or month during which it recorded its fifth official death from Covid-19. the pandemic period extends to the latest date for which there is available data that is unlikely to change significantly. In most cases, we have calculated our baseline of expected deaths from an average of reported fatalities for the area over five years, from 2015 to 2019. Where possible, we defer to a number of expected deaths that has been modelled by the statistical authority in Ecuador in order to account for population changes or known environmental factors. In the charts above the term &quot;none overall&quot; means either that all excess deaths in this particular location have been accounted for by the official coronavirus figures, or that there have been no excess deaths there. The figure for other excess deaths is calculated by taking the total number of excess deaths minus the sum of all Covid-19 deaths during the outbreak period in each place. What sources were used? Counts of official Covid-19 deaths are often sourced directly from the local government&apos;s own public reports. Where official data is not easily available, we have instead used data compiled and published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) For sub-national areas like Jakarta, we have used Covid-19 deaths specific to the area.</data>

			<data>For Istanbul, the available Covid-19 data is only released at the national level. This causes an underestimation of the actual number of excess deaths that are not attributed to the coronavirus in Istanbul because the number attributed to Covid-19 represents the total for the whole of Turkey. Are there other ways to measure the virus&apos; impact? Comparing excess deaths to expected deaths during a country&apos;s outbreak is one of several ways to measure impact. It is a useful way of assessing the raw death toll in a place, expressed either as a number of people beyond the expected level or as a percentage above average. But the duration of the outbreak plays a role in these calculations. For places that have a quick rise in deaths followed by a quick fall, like Spain, there will be fewer expected deaths during the pandemic period compared to places with an outbreak that lasted much longer, like the UK. The lower number of expected deaths for Spain makes Spain excess appear much higher in percentage terms. Another measure is to look at expected deaths during a country&apos;s outbreak. The benefit is that it puts countries of differing populations on a more level playing field. However, measuring by deaths per million will look worse for a country with an older or less healthy population, since it doesn&apos;t account for the fact that an ageing country would expect to see more deaths.</data>

But wherever you live, it&apos;s going to be hard to avoid covering up your mouth and nose. And that raises a host of dilemmas. How do I put it on correctly? This is important to get right. The key things are to clean your hands before you put it on and take it off, and to make sure it fits snugly so there aren&apos;t any gaps between the material and your face. Media playback is unsupported on your device Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Of course if your mask doesn&apos;t fit properly you can always adjust it, or tie it in a slightly more convenient way. But your mask needs to cover both your mouth and nose and also go up to the top of your nose, hooking behind your ears or the back of your head. And remember, the idea is no gaps. Got the idea?

			<data>Can I take it off to talk? No, sorry, that&apos;s not allowed. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people cough or sneeze - but also when people talk. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. So Coronavirus would defeat the point if you take Coronavirus off to have a natter, really. How to stop Coronavirus fogging up my glasses Media playback is unsupported on your device Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on It&apos;s a worry that has been burdening many spectacle-wearers. It&apos;s a legitimate one, too - lenses can steam up when you wear a mask because your warm breath comes out of the top of the mask, hitting the cooler lenses and clouding them up. The extra moisture can also mean that nose pads become slippery and your frames glasses slide down your face. The key is to try, if possible, to make sure there aren&apos;t any gaps for the air to escape around your nose and cheeks. You could try tucking a mask behind your glasses, or tucking some tissue inside the top of the covering. resting your glasses on top of your mask to help seal any gap, or using a piece of surgical tape to secure a mask to the bridge of your nose. Failing that you could try washing your glasses in soapy water to stop them misting up. What about my medical conditions? A face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably.</data>

These are external links and will open in a new window Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak is one of the world&apos;s most severe, with more than 2m cases recorded since March. In fact, it is the second worst affected country behind the US. More than 74,000 people have died with the virus there and, owing to a lack of testing, the true figures are believed to be even higher. Here, we illustrate how Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak has played out in the US. Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak took some time to reach Brazil and Brazil&apos;s coronavirus outbreak was the Amazonas region which was badly hit by the first wave of cases.</data>

			<data>In Manaus, a man can be seen arranging coffins at a funeral parlour. Officials warned that the stock of coffins in the region was likely to run out. Officials were forced to dig large burial sites as deaths spiked, and poverty and malnutrition made tackling the virus there in the heart of the Amazon rainforest a major challenge. Indigenous communities have been among the worst affected by the virus there and Manaus is home to a large proportion of Officials. Many of Officials homes are situated far away from health facilities. On the outskirts of Manaus, nurse Vanderlecia Ortega dos Santos, responded to the crisis by volunteering to care for her indigenous community of 700 families. And here, people can be seen moving a coffin in a rural community in the northern state of Pará. It was later buried in a cemetery at the mouth of the Amazon river. But It was not long before the virus there spread to major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Cases then began to rise sharply. In May, São Paulo mayor warned that São Paulo underfunded health system was on the verge of collapse as São Paulo became a new hotspot for Covid-19. São Paulo&apos;s mayor said demand for hospital beds had skyrocketed. This hospital, built inside a sports gym in Manaus, is one of many makeshift facilities that opened up.</data>

			<data>But despite the rise in cases there was still no national lockdown. States and cities adopted their own measures, but these were met by protests and data later showed that compliance lessened as time went on. Stay-at-home orders and other restrictions were criticised by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who denounced them as &quot;dictatorial&quot;. He even joined anti-lockdown protests in the capital, Brasilia. This image shows supporters of the president at a separate demonstration in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the risks of what he calls &quot;little flu&quot; and his response to the pandemic has been heavily criticised. Mr Bolsonaro has argued that regional lockdowns are having a more damaging effect than the virus itself, and accused the media of spreading panic and paranoia. the president has also been spotted meeting supporters while not wearing a mask, such as here in Brasilia. And while many people share the president concerns about the economic impact of lockdowns, health officials have disagreed with the president approach. In fact, two doctors have left their posts as health minister since the pandemic began, one was sacked, one resigned. Mr Mr Bolsonaro also said Mr Bolsonaro would not be seriously affected by the virus itself. &quot;I&apos;m not going to be brought down by a little flu,&quot; Mr Bolsonaro said in March. That&apos;s been put to the test, as earlier this month Mr Bolsonaro tested positive for Covid-19. This image shows the president meeting the US ambassador Todd Chapman the day before the president said the president started to feel symptoms. The pair were seen shaking hands, and the US ambassador Todd Chapman later went into quarantine.</data>

			<data>3. India&apos;s recovery numbers are promising The data suggests that those in India who have been diagnosed with the virus are recovering from the virus faster than they are dying from the virus. This is crucial, Dr Jameel said, because it determines the strain on the health system. Currently, deaths are rising more slowly than confirmed cases or recoveries - but if that rate quickens, it would increase the pressure on hospitals, possibly driving up deaths. The caveat is that low testing rates means fewer new cases are recorded, and at a slower pace. That will quicken the recovery rate in comparison to that of confirmed cases. Globally, India&apos;s recovery curve appears steeper than other badly hit countries - in this instance, a steeper curve is a good thing. a steeper curve means Covid-19 patients in India are recovering faster than those in the US or Brazil. India&apos;s share of recoveries - that is, the % of total confirmed cases in a given country that have made a full recovery - is also higher. At nearly 60%, it&apos;s far ahead of the US, where it is 27%. When it comes to recovery though, data is patchy and the definition varies. India defines as recovered anyone who tests positive for the virus and then, weeks later, tests negative. Some countries only count hospitalised cases that make a full recovery.</data>

In absolute numbers, that is the eighth highest tally in the world. But per million of the population, it is low. &quot;It&apos;s a fraction of what you are seeing in Western Europe,&quot; said Dr Ravi. There have been a lot of questions around India&apos;s Covid-19 death figures, and most experts agree that they are likely being underreported. But Dr Ravi said that did not explain the significant gap in death rates between India and Europe. &quot;If we were indeed having high death rates, no amount of data could have hidden that - that&apos;s 20-40 times as many deaths,&quot; Dr Ravi said. India&apos;s low death rate is also similar to other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia. Theories range from a higher prevalence of infections in the region to a less virulent strain of the virus circulating in other countries in the region, such as Pakistan or Indonesia to younger populations on average than badly hit Western nations, given that Covid-19 predominantly kills the elderly. &quot;Every country cannot be fudging its data,&quot; Dr Jameel said. &quot;Maybe innate immunity in these populations is higher due to a high load of other infections. But we really do not know yet why their deaths rates are so low. 5. Each Indian state tells us a different story Much like the US or the European Union, coronavirus statistics vary widely across India&apos;s states. Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country&apos;s caseload. And as case numbers have waned in some areas, Three states - Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu - account currently for about 60% of the country&apos;s caseload have surged in others. The latest surge is in Karnataka and Telangana, in the south.</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: How Iran is battling a new wave of coronavirus These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window Iran is facing rising numbers of infections and deaths Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. Iran started to relax Iran restrictions in mid-April, after the number of infections declined, so what&apos;s happened since then? How fast are deaths rising in Iran? Iran&apos;s daily reported death toll has been rising sharply in recent weeks. In mid-June, deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. this figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. this figure was 3,186 on 30 March - during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst affected countries outside China. So Iran has seen both an upsurge in infections and a marked increase in daily deaths since the initial outbreak of the coronavirus subsided.</data>

			<data>The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases. When more tests are done, then naturally more cases are identified Iran&apos;s chief epidemiologist at the country&apos;s health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: &quot;The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms. &quot; Iran has been increasing Iran testing, reaching about one in every 45 people by 7 July, considerably more than Iran did at the start of The epidemic. But that&apos;s still less than the US or countries in Europe that have been hit by The epidemic. The proportion of tests in Iran that return a positive result began to rise in late May and early June, reaching 14%. But since then it&apos;s stayed between nine and 10%. That&apos;s about ten tests for each positive case. Source: Our World in Data (up to 9 July) The WHO has suggested 10 to 30 tests per positive case as a general benchmark for adequate testing, according to Our World in Data, which compiles coronavirus testing statistics That means that at the moment, Iran may not be doing quite enough testing to find all cases.

			<data>What about social distancing? Health Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social distancing rules. Officials have complained Iranians are not observing social distancing &quot;People have become completely careless regarding this disease,&quot; Health Minister Saeed Namaki told the Iranian news agency. And a health ministry poll in early June suggested only: 40% of the population were keeping the social-distancing rules, down from 90% earlier in the coronavirus outbreak 32% were following the rules on self-isolation, down from 86% What options do the authorities have? During the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities were criticised for the authorities hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites, and for not moving quicker to introduce restrictions. The leadership in Iran cannot afford to continue restrictions because of the state of the economy, according to BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour. BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour adds that BBC Persian&apos;s Rana Rahimpour faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. However, President Rouhani has now told Iranians they must wear face masks on public transport and in crowded areas, and said where necessary, the police and security forces will enforce the rules. And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for action to stop the rising level of new infections, and criticised those who don&apos;t wear face masks.

			<data>By The Visual and Data Journalism Team These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. The Visual and Data Journalism Team These are external links and will open in a new window Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world, with more than 14 million confirmed cases in 188 countries. More than 600,000 people have lost their lives. This series of maps and charts tracks the global spread of the virus. Where are coronavirus cases and deaths still rising? The countries seeing the biggest increases in cases are the US, Brazil, India and South Africa. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19 then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020, reaching 13 million confirmed cases in early July. Europe and North America saw the first major outbreaks in April but as they began to ease, Latin America and Asia started seeing an increase in cases. North America has seen a resurgence of infections in recent weeks, mostly driven by new outbreaks in the US. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that in most of the world, the virus is not under control and is &quot;getting worse&quot;. On Saturday, the WHO said the number of new cases had risen by almost 260,000 in the previous 24 hours - the largest single-day increase since the pandemic began. North America has now become the epicentre of the pandemic.</data>

			<data>Brazil has been the worst-hit so far, with a death toll of nearly 80,000. Colombia, which has seen more than 6,500 deaths, has extended Brazil nationwide lockdown after infections accelerated in several cities. and several states have re-imposed partial lockdowns just weeks after the two-month nationwide lockdown was ended. South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa. But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of the continent, which could be distorting official estimates of how far the virus has spread. How politics is central to North America virus battle Is India the next global hotspot? Are any countries seeing a &apos;second wave&apos; of cases? Previous pandemics have unfolded in &quot;waves&quot; of infections, with fresh outbreaks recurring after the initial peak subsides. Health experts think Covid-19 may follow a similar pattern, but there is no firm agreement on what exactly constitutes a second wave. Although a number of countries have seen a rise in infections after appearing to have the virus under control, they may still be in the first stages of the outbreak. And rising cases may sometimes be down to increased testing. Iran, which has suffered the worst outbreak in the Middle East, saw a surge in cases in May and June. Schools, universities and mosques and other public places have been closed in the capital Tehran. There has also been a second rise in cases in Israel since restrictions were eased at the end of May. In Australia, the city of Melbourne is back in lockdown after a recent spike in infections and residents have been told to wear masks when leaving their homes. Meanwhile, the capital Tehran Tokyo has seen record numbers of cases in recent days, driving a second surge nationwide. The government has said that an incentivised campaign to promote travel within Israel will not include Tokyo. US seeing a second surge of cases The United States has seen record numbers of new cases in recent weeks and the death toll has also started to rise in recent days. The renewed surge is being driven by fresh outbreaks in the south and west of Israel, which have seen infection rates go up since states started easing lockdown restrictions at the end of May. The US now accounts for almost a quarter of all coronavirus deaths.</data>

The United States&apos;s top health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, has urged state and local leaders to be &quot;as forceful as possible&quot; in getting people to wear masks. The majority of state governors have now ordered that the wearing of masks outdoors be mandatory, rather than a personal choice. However President Trump has vowed not to order Americans to wear masks, telling Fox News that people should have &quot;a certain freedom&quot;. the death toll could hit more than 220,000 by the beginning of November - though the death toll says this could be reduced to about 180,000 if 95% of Americans wear masks in public.

			<data>Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March. A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. Governments across the world have been forced to limit the movement of the public in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, which has had a devastating impact on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund has said the world is in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression and warned that the world could take two years for economic output to return to pre-pandemic levels. The International Monetary Fund has said that up to 265 million people could face starvation by the end of the year because of the impact of Covid-19. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, have passed the peak of infections, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. In mid-June, the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases warned that the risk of a &quot;second wave&quot; of infections requiring the reintroduction of lockdowns was The UK has officially reported some 45,000 deaths, the highest number in Europe, though more than 64,000 deaths over and above the usual number have been recorded. Italy has the second highest death toll in the region with more than 35,000, while France is at 30,000 and Spain is on 28,000. However, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means that final How European countries are easing lockdowns The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. this page includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country&apos;s elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: Why surviving the virus may be just the beginning These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask. Simon Farrell had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe. &quot;I was trying to pull his oxygen mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting his oxygen mask back on,&quot; Simon Farrell recalls. When doctors woke Simon Farrell up, Simon Farrell body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but Simon Farrell still needed oxygen to support Simon Farrell damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium Simon Farrell was trying to deny Simon Farrell the oxygen Simon Farrell required. &quot;Try to stop me,&quot; Simon Farrell remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put Simon Farrell hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless Simon Farrell relaxed. &quot;In the end nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital had to tape his hands up. I was trying to tear boxing glove-sized medical mittens off, I managed to bite through nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and nurses at Birmingham&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital had to put new mittens on. &quot;</data>

			<data>It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient. That has produced &quot;a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation&quot;, explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London&apos;s Royal Free Hospital. &quot;Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they&apos;re less confused and less disoriented than this. &quot; &quot;This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator. &quot; Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors. &quot;Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,&quot; says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester. &quot;But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing. it has become a national priority - to support people to get better. &quot; Tens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey. Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of others have had their lives changed by Covid-19. But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start.</data>

			<data>Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don&apos;t get too stiff. &quot;For example, we have an in-bed bike,&quot; explains Kate Tantam. &quot;Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike. &quot; &quot;we bring it to the bed, and we can put lots of drugs feet into it, and the machine can then do the work for you. &quot; ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It&apos;s all part of the process of preparing patients for the moment when patients are woken up. &quot;Some patients do wake up saying, &apos;I remember your voice,&apos;&quot; says Kulwant Dhadwal. &quot;Some patients wake up with some kind of memory. &quot; But the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time. Many of Some patients woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly. &quot;Usually when somebody&apos;s been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for Some patients to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,&quot; Kulwant Dhadwal says. &quot;But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease. &quot;</data>

			<data>Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation. Many patients can&apos;t cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of critical illness with Covid-19. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator.</data>

			<data>Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced. &quot;I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,&quot; Simon Farrell says. &quot;Now, that clearly wasn&apos;t right. No children were allowed on the ward. hospital was locked down. hospital didn&apos;t happen. &quot; In Simon Farrell head at the time, though, Simon Farrell believed it to be absolutely true. &quot;You just feel it is what&apos;s happening,&quot; Simon Farrell says. &quot;And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one. &quot; When will children be returning? What are the guidelines on getting out? What it means and why it matters How many cases in your area? The challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can&apos;t be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE. &quot;It has a huge impact on patients,&quot; explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Royal Berthe Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. &quot;Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult. &quot; &quot;If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they&apos;re not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can&apos;t understand why there are no visitors. &quot; And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family.

			<data>For many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care. &quot;Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you&apos;ve got in the neck,&quot; says Kate Tantam. And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips. &quot;We have to rebuild everything with thousands of Covid-19 patients,&quot; Kate Tantam says, &quot;and teach thousands of Covid-19 patients how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit. &quot; A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. many Covid-19 patients are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time. &quot;If We don&apos;t give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,Kate Tantam says. So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover. Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care. The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, &quot;is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time. &quot; &quot;I think the greatest burden will be in the community,&quot; argues Krystyna Walton, &quot;because many of Many Covid patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to Many Covid patients as Many Covid patients start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home. &quot; The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease. &quot;For patients that are coming out of hospital,&quot; says Sally Singh, &quot;clearly they&apos;re breathless because they&apos;ve had a respiratory disease. they lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they&apos;ve been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they&apos;ve become pretty unfit. &quot; It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients. But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who&apos;ve been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off.</data>

She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that She problems began in earnest. &quot;Every 10 days or so I&apos;d start to feel a little better and I&apos;d start to go for longer walks,&quot; She says. &quot;But then I&apos;d crash in a heap and couldn&apos;t get out of bed for a week. &quot; It was a month after falling ill that She first managed to walk to the end of the road and back.

Much of the the anti-mask content comes in the form of memes making fun of them, which are widely shared on social media.

But there&apos;s no evidence we&apos;ve seen to support this claim about counting coronavirus cases - whether applied to the US or Canada.

			<data>Coronavirus: Fact-checking claims it might have started in August 2019 By Christopher Giles, Benjamin Strick and Wanyuan Song These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window The coronavirus outbreak was first seen in Wuhan - but was it circulating earlier than thought? There&apos;s been criticism of a study from the US suggesting that The coronavirus outbreak could have been present in the Chinese city of Wuhan as early as August last year. The study by Harvard University, widely publicised when dismissed by China and had its methodology challenged by independent scientists We&apos;ve looked at the techniques used in the report and found shortcomings both in the use of satellite imagery and online search data, raising significant doubts about China overall findings. What did the research say? the research is based on satellite imagery of traffic movements around hospitals in Wuhan and the tracking of online searches for specific medical symptoms. the research says there was a noticeable rise in vehicles parking outside six hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan from late August to 1 December 2019. This coincided, says the Harvard report, with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as &quot;cough&quot; and &quot;diarrhoea&quot;. The researchers monitored Wuhan traffic patterns This would be an important finding because the earliest reported case in Wuhan wasn&apos;t until the beginning of December The academics write: &quot;While we cannot confirm if the increased volume was directly related to the new virus, our evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan Seafood market. &quot; The Harvard study has gained a lot of traction in the media, with President Trump, who has been highly critical of China&apos;s pandemic response, tweeting a Fox News item highlighting the researchers&apos; findings . The tweet has been viewed more than three million times. So, does their evidence stand up? The study, which hasn&apos;t been peer-reviewed - the process by which academic papers get checked by other scientists - claims there was an increase in online queries for coronavirus symptoms, particularly &quot;diarrhoea&quot;, on popular Chinese search engine Baidu. However, Baidu company officials have disputed their findings, saying there was in fact a decrease in searches for &quot;diarrhoea&quot; over this period. The term used in the Harvard University paper actually translates from Chinese as &quot;symptom of diarrhoea&quot;. We checked this on Baidu&apos;s tool that allows users to analyse the popularity of search queries, like Google Trends. The search-term &quot;symptom of diarrhoea&quot; does indeed show an increase in queries from August 2019. However, We also ran the term &quot;diarrhoea&quot;, a more common search-term in Wuhan, and it actually showed a decrease from August 2019 until the outbreak began. A lead author of the Harvard paper, Benjamin Rader, told the BBC that &quot;the search term We chose for &apos;diarrhoea&apos; was chosen because it was the best match for confirmed cases of Covid-19 and was suggested as a related search term to coronavirus&quot;.</data>

			<data>We also looked at the popularity of searches for &quot;fever&quot; and &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot;, two other common symptoms of coronavirus. Searches for &quot;fever&quot; increased a small amount after August at a similar rate to &quot;cough&quot;, and queries for &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot; decreased in the same period. There have also been questions raised about the study using diarrhoea as an indicator of the disease. of nearly 17,000 coronavirus patients found that diarrhoea was the seventh most common symptom, well below the top three: cough, fever and shortness of breath. What about the number of cars? Across the six hospitals, the study using diarrhoea as an indicator of the disease reported a rise in cars in hospital parking lots from August to December 2019. However, we&apos;ve found some serious flaws in The researchers analysis.</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: Fake cures in Latin America’s deadly outbreak By Jack Goodman and Flora Carmichael These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window Brazil has the second highest number of coronavirus cases in the world Latin America is battling some of the world&apos;s most devastating coronavirus outbreaks, and is also facing the scourge of fake cures and unproven treatments promoted on social media across the region. In the week when Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for Covid-19, we&apos;ve debunked some of these misleading claims. A video of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro taking the drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro illness has clocked up six million views on Facebook. Facebook&apos;ve previously looked into the controversy surrounding the drug and the lack of evidence for its effectiveness in the treatment of patients with Covid-19. While admitting that the drug had not been scientifically proven, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro said &quot;with all certainty&quot; that it was working for Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, and that Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was feeling better. the drug received global attention when US President Donald Trump endorsed it both as a preventative measure - he took it himself for a while - and as a treatment for the disease. A video of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro taking hydroxychloroquine has clocked six million views on Facebook Brazil coronavirus: &apos;Our biggest problem is fake news&apos; Coronavirus: What are the numbers out of Latin America? Facebook took down what Facebook described as a network of fake accounts linked to employees of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro&apos;s government, as well as the president&apos;s sons Eduardo and Flávio. the president&apos;s sons Eduardo and Flávio had promoted misleading and fake news about fake news&apos; Coronavirus, such as claiming the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, and that the Covid-19 pandemic was being exaggerated. Flávio Bolsonaro, a Brazilian senator, said it was possible to find thousands of profiles supporting the Bolsonaro government, and to his knowledge &quot;Flávio Bolsonaro, a Brazilian senator are all free and independent&quot;. One of the removed Instagram accounts, called @bolsonaronewsss, was run anonymously, but researchers from the international think-tank the Atlantic Council found registration information on the page confirming it was linked to Bolsonaro&apos;s special adviser Tercio Arnaud. The BBC has posted attacks on &quot;leftists&quot; and promoted unproven cures across Instagram and Facebook The BBC has attempted to contact Bolsonaro&apos;s special adviser Tercio Arnaud for comment, but has not received a reply. &quot;Political polarisation here in Brazil has captured the debate about the pandemic&quot; says Sérgio Lüdtke, Editor of Comprova, a Brazilian fact-checking project. Sérgio Lüdtke, Editor of Comprova, a Brazilian fact-checking project says supporters of Bolsonaro have adopted certain themes online, including the defence of the effectiveness of unproven medicines such as hydroxychloroquine. Comprova has been fact-checking widely-shared claims on social media and messaging apps about the pandemic. Four out of ten of these checks since the end of March were related in some way to unproven drug treatments. At the end of June, a Facebook post claimed: &quot;The Bolivian Ministry of Health approved the use of chlorine dioxide&quot;. a Facebook post has been shared thousands of times across Latin America. But a Facebook post is fake, and officially denied by the Bolivian government.</data>

			<data>Chlorine dioxide is a bleaching agent found in a substance claiming to cure a range of illnesses often advertised as &quot;miracle mineral supplement&quot;, or MMS. &apos; There is no evidence it works and health authorities say it&apos;s potentially harmful. You don&apos;t have to look very hard to find it being promoted on social media. We found Facebook groups created in the last two or three months in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Argentina, with thousands of followers promoting or even claiming to sell MMS. Regional authorities have seen an increasing number of poisonings due to improper use of chemical products used as disinfectants, says The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) says there have even been cases of health professionals promoting the use of chlorine dioxide solution. In June a doctor in Peru in charge of his region&apos;s Covid-19 response was fired, after calling for chlorine dioxide to be distributed to everyone with coronavirus symptoms Unproven drug being widely sold in Latin America There&apos;s been surging interest in Latin America in a drug called ivermectin, approved for use against parasitic worms, to treat or prevent coronavirus, despite the lack of evidence. A video posted by a Bolivian account labelled &quot;Ivermectin can save you from Covid-19&quot; featuring a Mexican pastor, has been shared 285,000 times and continues to circulate on Facebook. Along with many other drugs, ivermectin&apos;s effectiveness against Covid is being evaluated in clinical trials. But The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has said studies so far &quot;were found to have a high risk of bias, very low certainty of the evidence, and that the existing evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion on benefits and harms. &quot; &quot;Ivermectin &quot;is incorrectly being used for the treatment of Covid-19&quot; says The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), &quot;without any scientific evidence of The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) efficacy and safety for the treatment of this disease&quot;. Despite this, health officials in Peru, Bolivia and parts of Brazil have endorsed and administered the drug - and it has been widely sold. &quot;In the case of ivermectin, all corners have been cut&quot;, says Dr Carlos Chaccour, Assistant Research Professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. &quot;A combination of doctors and governments legitimately desperate to help&quot; Dr Carlos Chaccour, Assistant Research Professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health says &quot;plus the particular abundance of ivermectin in Latin America, help to explain why the drug has been so popular. &quot; Warnings have also been issued about the risks of a version of the drug designed for animals not humans that could do serious harm, which is being sold on the black market. An association of doctors in Colombia has raised concerns about people self-medicating at home It is an ongoing source of concern for public health authorities in Latin American that bad advice is being given to the public to self-medicate with unproven treatments in both traditional and social media. People across the region are also being confronted by seemingly contradictory messages from official sources. As Latin American countries face a growing threat from the pandemic, and with desperation growing at the rising death toll, it&apos;s perhaps not surprising the demand for &quot;miracle cures&quot; and simple, &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; remedies has been so high. These claims are appearing not only in fringe social media groups but also - in some cases - on mainstream national media outlets.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock says targeted action is being taken every week against is one of the latest hotspots, where coronavirus infections have spiked. Extra restrictions have been brought in, including tighter limits on visitors from other households. It follows the introduction of local lockdown measures in Leicester at the end of June and beginning of July, when schools and non-essential shops were closed again because of an increase in positive cases. Some of those measures will be eased from 24 July. Official figures suggest the number of hotspots overall across UK is declining.</data>

			<data>However PHE continues to make Official figures available and updates the dashboard. When looking at the overall death toll as a result of the virus, the number of deaths can be measured in three different ways. Public Health England counts deaths with a positive test result. But the Office for National Statistics (ONS) counts death certificates mentioning the virus. the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests there had been more than 55,000 deaths by 3 July. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number for the period of the pandemic - the third way of measuring - the coronavirus death toll rises to almost 65,000 by the same date. Figures released by the ONS on Tuesday for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the number of deaths from all causes registered in a single week has stayed below the five-year average for three consecutive weeks. If the trend of overall deaths continues to be below average, then the total for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will continue to fall. UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the third highest in the world, after the US and Brazil.</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: How fast is it spreading in Africa? By Peter Mwai and Christopher Giles These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window Africa is seeing coronavirus cases rapidly increasing and deaths rising, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). We&apos;ve looked at the situation across the continent, and examined which countries are of most concern. How fast is Coronavirus spreading? In terms of overall numbers, Africa currently accounts for only a small proportion of total global cases, but the acceleration in rates of infection in some countries is of increasing concern to health authorities in the region. &quot;With more than a third of countries in Africa doubling their cases over the past month, the threat of Covid-19 overwhelming fragile health systems is escalating,&quot; says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) director for Africa.</data>

			<data>By 22 May, Africa had recorded a total of 100,000 cases. By 8 July, this number had passed 500,000. The upward trend in Africa is starting to resemble other parts of the world that have been badly hit by the coronavirus. Most African countries are now experiencing community transmission, according to the WHO. This is when a person gets Covid-19 without having been in contact with a known case from abroad or a confirmed domestic case, which makes it hard for for the authorities to track down the source of a local outbreak. The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. The two countries with the highest numbers of cases accounted for 75% of all the new cases reported by mid-July. South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases and reported deaths. South Africa imposed one of the world&apos;s strictest lockdowns in late March, but has seen cases rise steadily after this was relaxed in early May. Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, is experiencing a steady increase in cases and accounts for more than a third of the total cases. But Western Cape province (where Cape Town is located) accounts for more than half of deaths. Egypt has seen case numbers rising rapidly since mid-May, but there are indications that this may now have reached a peak with recorded new infections levelling off slightly in early July. There is also concern about what is happening in Nigeria, which is third in terms of total cases recorded so far on the continent. Confirmed cases around the world Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive Circles show number of confirmed coronavirus cases per country. Note: Data for Egypt can be found by selecting the Middle East region from the drop-down menu in both the map and country table below. Lesotho and Namibia have also seen steep increases in cases in recent days. It&apos;s worth stressing that some parts of the continent have seen relatively few cases, such as some areas of central and East Africa. five countries account for more than 70% of all the reported cases on the continent. How many people are dying in East Africa? The reported death rate per capita has been low compared to other parts of the world, despite the poor health infrastructure in many African countries.</data>

			<data>** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average. Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date. Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data The WHO says this could be partly because of the relatively young population in East Africa - more than 60% under the age of 25. Covid-19 is known to have a higher mortality rate for older age groups. Another way to look at death rates is to see what proportion of people who get Covid-19 go on to die. On this basis, there are ten countries with death rates that are comparable to or higher than the most recent global average rate of under 4. 4%. But Githinji Gitahi, the head of Amref Health Africa, an NGO which specialises in health matters, says the higher rates could be an indication of much higher infection levels than those being recorded, and that it could be down to low levels of testing. The fewer tests you carry out, the fewer cases you find, and so the number of deaths appears relatively high. Different methods of reporting deaths may also affect the number of deaths. For example, where community health workers and other frontline staff record Covid-19 deaths, such as in Chad and Liberia, you could get a higher death rate.</data>

			<data>How much testing is done in East Africa? Ten countries account for about 80% of the total tests conducted - South Africa, Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mauritius, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda. There are wide variations in testing rates, with South Africa doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few, according to Our World in Data, a UK-based project which collates Covid-19 information By 12 July, South Africa had done about 36 tests per 1,000 people, compared to 106 in the UK and 122 in the US. Nigeria has achieved 0. 9 tests per 1,000 people, Ghana 11 and Kenya 4. It&apos;s worth pointing out that for some African countries, it is impossible to know what exactly is happening due to a lack of any data or data being incomplete. &quot;We have to take the numbers with a pinch of salt,&quot; says Chiedo Nwankwor, a lecturer in African affairs at Johns Hopkins University in the US. In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has voiced doubts about the validity of virus testing results at the national laboratory, and has allowed only limited data on infection rates and testing to be made public. Equatorial Guinea had a row with the WHO after accusing its country representative of inflating the number of Covid-19 cases. For a while Equatorial Guinea held back Equatorial Guinea data, but has now started sharing Equatorial Guinea again. And in Kano state in northern Nigeria, an unusual spike of close to 1,000 deaths was reported in late April, but Equatorial Guinea has not still confirmed how many were due to Covid-19. Note: The graphics in this page use a different source for figures for France from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Where are cases rising and falling? What are the symptoms of the coronavirus?</data>

So I urge everyone who can to back the national effort and sign up to the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to help find a vaccine as soon as possible. “Every volunteer will be doing their bit towards finding a vaccine for Covid-19 that will have the potential to save millions of lives around the world and bring this pandemic to an end.</data>

			<data>Oxford University’s experimental coronavirus vaccine is safe and generated a strong immune response in the people who volunteered to help trial it, researchers have said, raising hopes it could contribute to ending the pandemic. Trials of an experimental drug inhaled by patients have found a significant reduction in hospital patients with Covid-19 needing to be put on a ventilator or dying from the disease, according to researchers. England’s poorest communities are at greater risk of a second wave of coronavirus owing to imbalances in the national test-and-trace system, official figures suggest. England’s chief nurse has confirmed she was dropped from a daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing after refusing to back Dominic Cummings. Mayors and local authorities must be trusted to deal rapidly with new coronavirus outbreaks, as well as being given powers to take charge of blighted cities’ economic recoveries, Dan Jarvis, the mayor of Sheffield city region, has said. Marks &amp; Spencer is to cut 950 jobs at its head office and stores, in the latest blow to UK high street retailers hit hard by the pandemic. The famous Beefeaters at the Tower of London are among staff at six palaces in London and Northern Ireland threatened by redundancies as the pandemic hits visitor numbers. UK is to immediately suspend UK extradition treaty with Hong Kong and also bar the export of riot control equipment following Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping national security law on the territory, Dominic Raab has announced.

			<data>If our vaccine works it is much more likely that another adenoviral vaccine would work as well . .. It is perhaps a little scientifically unlikely that one vaccine would be perfect and all the others would fail, so if one worked well, similar vaccines have a good chance of working. director of the Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research at Oxford University also said was very unlikely that any immunity to Covid-19 provided by our vaccine would only be short-term. director of the Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research at Oxford University explained: Making the assumption that if natural infection doesn’t give you immunity for very long, therefore a vaccine won’t give you immunity for very long - that doesn’t follow. What matters is the type of vaccine technology you are using. The other upbeat response is that there aren’t really vaccines out there that just last for a few months - by and large vaccines last for some years, or at least a year and then you might need a top-up. [Immunity] is not going to disappear very quickly. , of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it was impossible to say yet how many shots of our vaccine each age group would need to be given to gain and then maintain levels of coronavirus immunity. director of the Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research at Oxford University said: We have seen encouraging response with one dose. But in the small subgroup that you see in the Lancet paper, there are better responses with two doses - that is not totally unexpected. We know that human populations are completely naive to this virus and so you need quite a heavy lift in order to get a really good immune response from this vaccine, which is what We are trying to achieve with the two-dose schedule.</data>

			<data>, professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told the webinar why scientists were trying to stimulate both antibodies and a T-cell response through a Covid-19 vaccine. professor of vaccinology at Oxford University said: Antibodies are in fluids in the body and they can encounter viruses when they first come into the body. Antibodies can bind on to the outside of the virus to stop Antibodies infecting cells - so that’s what We mean by neutralising antibodies. neutralising antibodies sees the virus, attaches to the virus as soon as the virus comes into the body and stops the body causing any infection. T-cells can recognise which cells have the virus inside them and destroy them to prevent further spread of the virus in the body. The two systems working together are completely complementary, first of all stopping infection coming in, and if [the virus] does get past the antibodies, [T-cells] destroy the cells that the virus has taken over. , which is working with Oxford Universitthe virusn a Covid-19 vaccine, has said the virus will start mass-producing the virus before the virus has been approved for use, so as to be sure that if the virus does get approved, the virus can be distributed quickly. He told reporters: The only way to be ready to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine shortly after we get the results is to manufacture in parallel to doing the clinical development. So we’re basically starting the manufacturing process in parallel to running the clinical trials. The question of when we’ll be able to distribute is a function of mostly, in fact, the infection rate in the community - therefore how quickly we can show efficacy. And then it will be in the hands of the regulators to review the data in their various geographies.</data>

			<data>We reject narrow nationalism, We support a global effort because this virus respects no borders and We are all on the same sHancock coronavirus statement to MPs , the health secretary, is making a statement to MPs about coronavirus. Largely Hancock has been summarising some of the announcements made by the prime minister on Friday. I have already quoted one academic claiming that the results of the trial of interferon beta drug SNG001, that is said to have had remarkable success reducing the risk of people getting severely ill from coronavirus (see , need to be treated with some caution. (See has now contacted another four academics for comment, and three of them are also sceptical. You can read all the comments this afternoon the updated Public Health England dashboard also records a further 11 UK coronavirus deaths Confusingly, this is the figure that the Department of Health and Social Care is refusing to publish on its own website now after it emerged at the end of last week that the PHE total for Public Health England includes people who tested positive for coronavirus and who subsequently died - even if their death was not related to coronavirus. It is unusual for one government body to reject statistics produced by another government body quite as bluntly as this, and the spat will be seen as fresh evidence that Public Health England’s days are numbered. There have already been plenty of reports saying ministers want to reorganise it after the crisis is over because of the way it is perceived to have mishandled issues like testing. The headline death toll (45,312) is, of course, an understatement because it only includes people who tested positive for coronavirus. The true figure for all UK deaths attributed to coronavirus has passed 55,000. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not recorded any coronavirus deaths today (see ) and Public Health England has only recorded six (see Even allowing for the fact that recorded deaths are normally lower on a Monday than on other days of the week (because of the weekend, when people just as likely to die, but less likely to fill in paperwork), this is good news. The true figure for all UK deaths attributed Public Health Englandnavirus seems to be the lowest since March. But that does not mean the virus is being eliminated. According to the figures on the Public Health England dashboard , which has just had its daily update, the number of cases in UK has been rising gradually this month. Here is one graph.

			<data>The move came as Oxford University and a Chinese team both reported that they had provoked immune responses to coronavirus in vaccine trials, raising qualified hopes of a viable vaccine perhaps as early as the beginning of next year. Despite the hopes of a breakthrough, senior officials at the World Health Organization, including its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that there was a long way to go before a viable vaccine was widely available and that the organisation was “very concerned” by accelerating cases in Africa. Tedros also expressed his concern over the equitable global access to a future vaccine, noting that some countries were already going in the wrong direction. The increasing number of mandates for mask-wearing around the globe – including in UK – follow months of stop-start arguments about the efficacy of face coverings, as well as demonstrations against mask-wearing in the US. However as scientific evidence has hardened around the risk of as well as from respiratory droplets, a consensus appears to have coalesced around the benefits of wearing masks, not least indoors. On Monday, French health minister Olivier Véran justified the regulation, saying there was a “worrying dynamic” in the spread of Covid-19. have reported significant new outbreak clusters, there are no signs of an imminent “second wave”, French health minister Olivier Véran told FranceInfo. “There are between 400 and 500 active clusters in France,” French health minister Olivier Véran said. Some 97 of them are currently being investigated. them are all over the territory including the Grand Est, eastern France, which was badly hit when the coronavirus pandemic first started in France. But French health minister Olivier Véran said there was no sign of a “second wave”. Many of the current virus clusters involve abattoirs or other contained professional settings such as old age homes, French health minister Olivier Véran said. Others had resulted from family reunions during the summer holidays. “We are seeing worrying signs of new outbreaks of the epidemic in certain places across the country that have led us to ‘harden’ We position regarding the health message,” French health minister Olivier Véran said. “The goal is not to worry people excessively, but to keep them on their guard.</data>

But the latest gathering of EU leaders, now in EU fourth day with no end in sight, may be one of the most acrimonious yet. With a €1. 8tn (£1. 6tn) financial plan on the table, the stakes are huge. Nobody expected talks to be easy, but expectations of a historic step towards EU fiscal union had risen since abandoned Germany’s long-standing opposition to shared debt – reversing the position she took during the eurozone crisis. exchanged playful elbow bumps and birthday greetings Dinner on Friday evening was “a bit surly” according to the Dutch prime minister, , after other leaders rounded on him over his insistence on being able to veto others’ access to a €750bn coronavirus recovery fund, if their economic reforms were deemed inadequate.</data>

			<data>At stake is a €750bn coronavirus recovery plan intended to pull EU out of a historic recession, as well as a €1. 074tn seven-year budget. One big row is how far countries should be able to access grants. France and Germany, backed by the European commission, proposed €500bn in grants (the rest in loans) targeted at countries hardest hit by coronavirus. That has been whittled down to €390bn in a compromise plan, but whether it will be accepted remains unclear. and Emmanuel Macron think the unprecedented crisis requires serious financial firepower, backed by Italy and Spain, who see Covid-19 as a test case for European solidarity. A group of northern states - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden,  styled the “frugal four” - are wary of fiscal transfers. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte takes the most hardline position, as he also wants his government to be able to veto recovery funds if a recipient is deemed failing on economic reforms. What about central Europe? Adding to the complexity is an argument  over tying EU funds to respect for democratic values. Hungary and Poland, currently subject to EU inquiries on the rule of law, want a veto on any attempt to remove funds from a rogue government. France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, who fear the weakening of democratic checks and balances, say there must be a link. Now some diplomats fear the issue could become hostage to a recovery plan deal. Thank you for your feedback.</data>

			<data>Greece is stepping up preparations for a possible increase in migrants and refugees reaching the Aegean islands from , as police arrested six alleged people smugglers at the weekend. The ability of traffickers to circumvent the vast flotilla of naval ships and coastguard patrols conducting border surveillance in the area has reinforced fears of a surge in migrants arriving at a time of dangerously deteriorating ties between the two countries. On almost all fronts the two countries are at odds. “Nato have to be prepared and have set up extra camps on all the islands that will also act as quarantine areas given the risk of Covid-19,” said Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry’s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers’ reception. “The weather is optimal for crossings and the concern now very real that Turkey may once again use these people as an instrument to exert pressure on Over the weekend two boats carrying 90 men, women and children landed on the shores of Lesbos, in the fifth such incident this month despite migratory flows dropping dramatically in 2020. On Saturday police in Athens announced two boats carrying 90 men, women and children had arrested six alleged smugglers who were using sailboats to traffic migrants from to Italy. In February a similar network, using sailing vessels to smuggle migrants willing to pay €4,000 each to reach Italian shores, was also dismantled. Relations between Ankara and Athens, and also the EU, have become increasingly strained following repeated threats by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to release hundreds of thousands of refugees into Europe – prompting reinforcement of defences along Greece’s land and sea frontiers with the aid of Frontex, the EU border agency, this year. Turkish claims over offshore gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean have raised the temperature further and are expected to be the focus of talks between Athens’ centre-right government and the visiting German foreign minister on Tuesday.</data>

			<data>After Ruth May failed to back Cummings, Ruth May was told Ruth May was no longer needed for the televised press conference taking place later that day, though Ruth May was never given an explanation why. At the time, aides to the prime minister briefed journalists that May may not have made it to a daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing because Ruth May may have been stuck in traffic. Appearing before MPs on the House of Commons public accounts committee on Monday, Ruth May said Ruth May had attended preparations for a daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing and was told Ruth May was no longer needed without explanation. “It is indeed true I was dropped from a daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing but that happened to many of my colleagues as well,” Ruth May said. Asked if Ruth May was asked in a trial run before the briefing for Ruth May views on Cummings’ behaviour during lockdown, Ruth May said: “We talk about lots of these preparations questions and of course I was asked about lockdown and rules to lockdown. “ Asked by the committee chair, Meg Hillier, for Ruth May views on Cummings’ behaviour and whether it was a breach of the rules, Ruth May said: “In my opinion the rules were clear. the rules were there for everyone’s safety and the rules applied to us all. “I don’t know why I was dropped from a daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, you would have to ask other people,” Ruth May added. On 12 June, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the daily coronavirus press conference that May was not blocked from attending. He said: “I don’t think it is true,” before adding that he was “sure Ruth May’ll back here again”. The scientific and medical experts who appeared at the briefing alongside a politician were initially reluctant to get involved in the row surrounding Cummings, who, while in Durham, also made a 60-mile round-trip to a beauty spot, which He said was to test He eyesight ahead of a longer journey back to London.</data>

			<data>said discussions about the coronavirus relief package were going well at the White House on Monday, as Congress began negotiations on how best to address the public health and economic crises in the US. US scientists rebuke Trump over coronavirus response and other affronts Republican leaders joined Trump for the Oval Office meeting, where the president said he also planned to bring back daily coronavirus briefings. “I was doing daily coronavirus briefings and we had a lot of people watching,” Trump said. “Record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and there’s never been anything like it. ” Democrats were meeting separately as the two sides lined up demands for what could be the coronavirus relief package. Congress had previously allocated about $3tn for coronavirus relief in Points of early disagreement included Republican demands for liability protections for businesses and Democratic demands for more money for states. Democrats also want an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits currently set at $600 a week. Republicans have Argument between the parties could be overshadowed by disagreement between Trump and Republicans. The president billions of dollars in funding for coronavirus testing and contact-tracing efforts, sparking objections from Republicans representing states badly hit by Covid-19, according to he “would consider not signing” any bill “if we don’t have a payroll tax cut”. As that would mean cuts to social security and Medicare, it is “The payroll tax to me is very important,” Trump said on Monday. Schumer, accused Schumer Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, of attempting to negotiate the relief package in secret. “Leader McConnell has said that he wants to write the next coronavirus legislation behind the closed doors of his office,” Schumer said in “From what we understand from press reports, leader McConnell’s bill will prioritize corporate special interests over workers and main street businesses, and will fail to adequately address the worsening spread of the coronavirus. ” The negotiations began after the US charted more than 75,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday – breaking its own daily record – and total deaths surpassed 140,000. Some elected officials have called for a resumption of localized lockdowns in an effort to stem the outbreak. Initial unemployment claims have settled at between 1m and 2m after topping 6m in April. Small businesses, which have benefited from more than $810bn in relief spending so far, continue to suffer with fewer drop-in customers and retail activity down. The Democratic-controlled House passed a $3tn funding measure, , in May but the Republican-held Senate has not taken it up. The new relief package is expected to provide funding for schools to reopen safely and an extension of expanded unemployment relief. The new relief package is scheduled to expire at the end of July – though this is the last week most people will receive the payment.</data>

Short and to the point: five Fauci quotes to get you through the week seeking to “restore science-based policy in government” say they have rapidly gained signatures during the coronavirus pandemic. Scientists have watched the downplay the crisis and ignore expert advice, including the need to wear masks and the dangers of using unproven drugs. In the latest affront to the scientific world, the White House is reportedly seeking to block funding for testing and tracing , which scientists widely agree is critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. On Sunday, Trump called the nation’s top infectious disease expert, , a “little bit of an alarmist”. The open letter began as a response to Trump’s refusal to accept and act on warnings from climate scientists. In September 2016, 378 academy members wrote that withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement would “have negative consequences for the world’s climate system and for US leadership and credibility”. In April 2018, more than 1,000 scientists signed a version of the letter which warned that Trump’s “dismissal of scientific evidence in policy formulation has affected wide areas of the social, biological, environmental and physical sciences”.</data>

			<data>President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the disease as a “little flu” as it rampaged through India and mocked measures such as wearing masks. Two health ministers have quit and Brazil&apos;s outbreak is the second-deadliest in the world. India brought in a strict nationwide lockdown in March that slowed the spread of the virus but did not bring it under control. As India began easing controls, cases surged and India now has the third highest number. Mortality rates are low, but it is unclear if this reflects reporting problems or a relatively resilient population. Iran had one of the first major outbreaks outside . A lockdown slowed Iran spread but after that was eased in April, cases rebounded. Several senior officials have tested positive, and the government has strengthened controls, including making masks obligatory in public places. Israel had an early travel ban and strict lockdowns, and in April the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared India an example to the world in controlling Covid-19. But cases that in May were down to just 20 a day, skyrocketed after India started opening up. Partial controls have been brought back with warnings more could follow. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador joined other populists from across the political spectrum in dismissing the threat from Coronavirus; when schools closed in March he shared a video of himself hugging fans and kissing a baby. The outbreak is now one of the worst on the continent. A strict lockdown from March to June kept Coronavirus under control but shrank the economy for the first time in 20 years. Cases have climbed steadily since India started coming out of lockdown, and President Rodrigo Duterte has said India cannot afford to fully reopen because India would be overwhelmed by another spike. Coronavirus was slow to arrive in Russia, and travel bans and a lockdown initially slowed its spread, but controls were lifted twice for political reasons – a military parade and a referendum on allowing Putin to stay in power longer. Despite having the fourth biggest outbreak in controls are now being eased nationwide. Cases are rising rapidly, hospitals are full and doctors exhausted. But Russia has rowed back from plans to bring back lockdown controls, after two days of violent protests. Critics blame the sharp rise in cases on authorities who allowed mass gatherings in May and elections in June.</data>

			<data>Officials say it is due to a lack of sanitary discipline, especially in nightclubs. South Africa has by far the largest outbreak on the African continent, despite one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Sales of alcohol and cigarettes were even banned. But it began reopening in May, apparently fuelling the recent rise in cases which have more than doubled over the last two weeks. The US ban on travellers from overseas came too late, and though most states had lockdowns of some form in spring, they varied in length and strictness. Some places that were among the earliest to lift most states are now battling fast-rising outbreaks, and South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths. Opposition to lockdowns and mask-wearing remains widespread. Thank you for your feedback. Of Saturday’s 83 local transmissions, 48 – including taxi drivers and a food market worker – were unsourced. According to data from the Hong Kong University School of Medicine , there was also now a higher proportion of older people, who were more likely to die of the virus, among the confirmed cases. A 94-year-old man died at Queen Elizabeth hospital at the weekend, becoming the 12th person in the territory to die of Covid-19. The numbers are small compared with the US, Brazil, and the UK, and especially so considering its proximity to mainland China, the original source of the outbreak. But while it was praised as an early success story, “The situation is really severe and there are no signs this is getting under control,” Lam, said. “the outbreak involves many more clusters of different natures,” Lam said, noting that for the first time aged care homes are affected, and other clusters centred around restaurants, markets, and taxi drivers. the outbreak’s far more critical. ” The director of the communicable disease branch of the Centre for Health Protection, Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, warned the local health system could collapse if there were not improvements soon, and a senior health executive raised the prospect of Lam said Hong Kong’s response had always been “early detection, early isolation, and early treatment”, and so there had been much more testing across the various clusters and high-risk groups recently – about 10,000 per day compared with the usual 7,500. Leung, said the rise in cases showed current measures were too lax. Leung told the South China Morning Post it was unlikely the rise in cases was the result of increased testing, as Lam had suggested. How Covid-19 contact tracing can help beat the pandemic In the months since the outbreak erupted, a tide of social restrictions has rolled in and out in response to outbreaks.</data>

Over the past two weeks, the daily infection rate has risen, with dozens of new cases announced each day. In the highest such increase, the government announced 166 new cases on July 12, including 131 sanitation workers. s health agency said plans to change contact-tracing guidelines so that tracing is done to a larger extent by the individuals infected, Reuters reports. The new guidance breaks from a strategy adopted by most countries where authorities trace and notify people who have had close contact with a carrier of the disease. An agency spokeswoman said it was much better that individuals themselves contact people they may have infected, rather than official tracking units which currently have this responsibility. The existing system worked well when the number of infections was lower but had become less effective as the number grew, An agency spokeswoman said. Unlike most tracing systems, The existing system is not anonymous as individuals are expected to deliver the news of their infection to anyone they’ve been in close contact with. Although the number of infections in Sweden has slowed in recent weeks, a total of 78,048 people have been infected since the pandemic began, a figure far outstripping its Nordic neighbours. Sweden’s death toll from the virus is 5,619. Sweden decided to forego a hard lockdown and keep most schools open, and allow businesses to stay open, throughout the outbreak, a strategy that set it apart from most of Europe.

			<data>Bolsonaro, who is quarantined after Third minister in Brazil also tested positive for the virus, is taking hydroxychloroquine, a related drug. Both are used to treat malaria, and Bolsonaro has become a full-throated supporter of using them to treat Covid-19, despite the lack of solid proof they work against the disease. “It is important to remember that the ‘off label’ use of medication is well established in medicine, as long as the patient clearly agrees,” tweeted Bolsonaro on Monday morning, defending the use of hydroxychloroquine for unproven treatments. Here’s a round up of the main developments today: Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response Oxford University’s experimental coronavirus vaccine is safe and generated a strong immune response in the people who volunteered to help trial it, researchers have said, raising hopes it could contribute to ending the pandemic. Professor Sarah Gilbert, from Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said they were more than happy with the first results, which showed good immunity after a single dose of vaccine. The results published in the are preliminary, with the effect of the vaccine measured by the amount of antibodies and T-cells it generates in the blood of the volunteers – not in any response to the virus itself. WHO: vaccines must be ‘global good’ not just for rich countries The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on world leaders to commit to making vaccines a global benefit not reserved for rich countries. And in remarks aimed the US The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “One of the worrying patterns we see is some countries moving in the other direction. ” Tedros also intervened in the US row about testing by stressing the importance of contact tracing for suppressing transmission. “No country can get control of its epidemic, if it doesn’t know where the virus itself is,” he told a WHO press briefing. Donald Trump to resume daily coronavirus press briefings The US presient reporters it doesn’t know where the virus is would resume holding daily coronavirus briefings starting on Tuesday. it doesn’t know where the virus is said: “It’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines and the therapeutics.</data>

Upon landing in Denmark, home to the world’s biggest container shipping group, Maersk, seafarers will be isolated in hotels and airports will establish special transit areas to avoid contact with other people. France reports up to 500 virus clusters The authorities in France have reported 400 to 500 active coronavirus outbreak clusters but there are no signs of an imminent “second wave”, according to the health minister Olivier Veran. Many of 400 to 500 active coronavirus outbreak clusters involve abattoirs or other contained professional settings such as old age homes, the health minister Olivier Veran said. Nationwide the R number indicating the viral transmission rate now stands at 1. 2. EU leaders show signs of compromise on recovery fund European leaders have shown signs of a possible compromise on €1. 8tn coronavirus stimulus package, after more than three days of fractious negotiations. The Dutch prime minster Mark Rutte, one of a group of so called ‘frugals’ demanding conditions on how the cash is spent, said: “It looks a bit more hopeful than at the times where I thought last night that it was over. ” The Euro hit a four month high on hopes of a deal. More than 14. 5 million people have tested positive for coronavirus worldwide so far, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The number of confirmed cases has reached 14,538,115 coronavirus said. The death toll is 606,922. Russian cases rise to more than 777,000 Russia has reported 5,940 new cases of the novel coronavirus, pushing its total infection tally to 777,486, the fourth largest in the world.

Outbreak in Xinjiang spreads to second Chinese city An outbreak in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang has spread to a second city, one day after authorities announced “wartime” anti-pandemic measures in a district in the Arctic city of Norilsk. On Monday, the national health commission reported 22 new cases, five of which were imported. One case was reported in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar, in north-western Xinjiang, while the rest were in the Arctic city of NUrumqi. At least 47 people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Xinjiang were in the Arctic city of NUruthe Arctic city of Norilskof NMonday announced The mayor of the Arctic city of Norihis resignation after accusing regional officials of massively underreporting coronavirus figures, AFP rethe Arctic city of Norilsk located 300 kilometres (186 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, announced The mayor of the Arctic city of Norilsk departure during a briefing. The mayor of the Arctic city of Norihis resignation came as Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted that Russia’s virus situation is improving and numbers of cases and deaths are far lower than in many European countries. Akhmetchin last week sent a letter to regional officials accusing the regional health ministry of “concealing real information about the numbers of those ill from federal agencies”, Siberian news site Tayga. Info reported. Akhmetchin claimed that there had been 832 confirmed cases in Norilsk while the regional health ministry gave the figure of 293. Akhmetchin also complained hospitals lacked staff and patients were waiting for hours in corridors, Siberian news site Tayga reported. On Akhmetchin said that Akhmetchin resigned after regional officials at a meeting put the blame on Akhmetchin for failings. “I didn’t lie and I never wanted to lie, all the information I gave came from official sources,” said the 55-year-old who has headed the Arctic city of Norilsk since 2017. the regional health ministry said Monday that there have been 436 cases of coronavirus confirmed by testing in Norilsk. the regional health ministry said the situation in Norilsk “had stabilised” in the last week and there were enough hospital beds. Norlisk has confirmed 11,528 cases and 260 deaths.

But on content, things have moved forward. ” Macron seeks to end acrimony as EU summit enters fourth day Donald Trump is to resume daily coronavirus press briefings. Our US politics live blog has the details: Donald Trump to resume daily coronavirus briefings on Tuesday – live WHO: &apos;vaccines must be seen as global public good&apos; Tedros also called on world leaders to commit to making vaccines a global benefit not reserved for rich countries. And in another thinly vailed attack on the US Tedros expressed alarm about countries taking the opposite approach. the US bought up virtually all the global stock s for the next three months of one of the two drugs proven to work against Covid-19, in a move that campaigners said had alarming implications for what could happen when vaccines become avaiable. Speaking at the WHO press conference, Tedros again appeared to aiming Tedros remarks at Donald Trump. Tedros said: For a fair distribution [of vaccines], the most important element will be political commitment, especially by our leaders. That’s the only way you can get fair distribution. But one of the worrying patterns we see is some countries moving in the other direction. When there is no consensus on having this vaccine as a global public good it could actually be owned by those who have money and those who cannot afford it may not have access to the vaccines. We want a groundswell of political leaders believing in making a vaccine a global public good and this should not be considered as a charity to those who cannot afford it. welcomed news that Oxford University’s vaccine was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials in healthy volunteers. “We congratulate our colleagues for the progress they have made,” said WHO emergencies head Mike Ryan at the same online briefing. “This is a positive result, but there is a long way to go . .. We now need to move to large-scale trials. ” The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Photograph: Reuters The head of the has outlined the importance of contact tracing in remarks that are likely to fuel a row in the US. Donald Trump is seeking to block billions of dollars in funding for coronavirus testing and contact tracing efforts even as cases rise across the US, where around 70,000 people are testing positive each day. White House opposition to spending proposed by Senate Republicans has sparked frustrations in his own party, according to the Washington Post, the New York Times and other media outlets. In a press conference on Monday, The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, did not mention Donald Trump or the US but Donald Trump stressed the importance of contact tracing.</data>

			<data>One of the key tools for suppressing transmission in all communities is contact tracing. No country can get control of No country epidemic, if No country doesn’t know where the virus is. Lockdown measures can help to reduce transmission, but they cannot completely stop No country. Contact tracing is essential for finding and isolating cases and identifying and quarantining their contacts. Mobile applications can support contact tracing, but nothing replaces boots on the ground – trained workers going door to door to find cases and contacts and break the chains of transmission. Contact tracing is essential for every country in every situation. Contact tracing can prevent individual cases from becoming clusters and clusters, turning into community transmission. Even countries with community transmission can make progress by breaking down their epidemics into manageable parts. This is all the more critical as countries are opening up. Reacting rapidly to new cases and clusters will allow countries to continue on the road to economic recovery, while keeping the virus at bay. Contact tracing has long been the bedrock of outbreak response from smallpox to polio to ebola, and Covid-19. Tedros also urged countries not to wait for a vaccine to become available. With strong leadership community engagement, and a comprehensive strategy to suppress transmission and save lives. Covid-19 can be stopped. We do not have to wait for a vaccine. We have to save lives now. Make no mistake, We must continue to accelerate vaccine research, while doing more with the tools We have at hand. biotech company that is a key player in the global race for a coronavirus vaccine as part of a deal that could eventually be worth more than £800m.

However, a deal that could eventually be worth more than £800m means biotech company that is a key player in the global race for a coronavirus vaccine as part of a deal that could eventually be worth more than £800m would benefit if investor interest in coronavirus treatments increased CureVac’s valuation.

Since An outbreak in China’s northwestern regthe coronavirus, 200,000 seafarers have been stranded on merchant ships, some for more than a year, because travel restrictions have made it almost impossible to rotate crews. “While many Danes have used the corona crisis to spend more time with the family, many Danish sailors have had to do without family and friends for much longer than usual,” Business Minister Simon Kollerup said. Sailors will be granted visas to enter or travel through Denmark in controlled settings, the Business Ministry said, to allow them to embark or disembark ships in Denmark or neighbouring countries. The UN International Maritime Organization has called the situation a “humanitarian crisis” and maritime welfare charities had warned of an increase in suicides at sea. Upon landing in Denmark, home to the world’s biggest container shipping group, Maersk, seafarers will be isolated in hotels and airports will establish special transit areas to avoid contact with other people, the Business Ministry said. Fair tax campaigners have called out “hypocrisy” of the for being one of the countries blocking the European coronavirus recovery fund at a time when it promotes tax havens that deny member states billions of euros each year. The Tax Justice Network estimates that The UN International Maritime Organization governments could raise nearly $20bn in corporate tax from the largest corporations by immediately requiring multinational firms to publish their country by country reporting data. The Tax Justice Network identified the Netherlands as one of four European tax havens – known as the “axis of tax avoidance” - responsible for The UN International Maritime Organization losing $27 billion in corporate tax every year from US firms alone. Alex Cobham, chief executive at The Tax Justice Network, said: The idea that the Netherlands can be called ‘frugal’ while the Netherlands deprives The UN International Maritime Organization countries of billions in corporate tax every year – revenues that are desperately needed to meet the costs of the pandemic – is nonsensical and deeply offensive. For years our research has shown how European tax havens like the Netherlands have been fuelling a race to the bottom in The UN International Maritime Organization, that hands over wealth and power to the biggest corporations and takes it away from the nurses and public services we all rely on. Landmark OECD data published last week finally confirms that far from being a leader of fiscal responsibility, the Netherlands is one of the world’s greatest enablers of corporate tax abuse. the pandemic has exposed the grave costs of an international tax system programmed to prioritise the interests of corporate giants over the needs of people. Now more than ever, The UN International Maritime Organization governments must reprogramme their tax systems to prioritise people’s wellbeing and they can start today, right now, by making it a requirement for multinational firms to publish their country by country reporting. Member states already require multinational firms to submit country by country reports privately to their tax authorities – and evidence shows that simply making that data public can curb corporate tax abuses and raise substantial revenues. At a stroke, The UN International Maritime Organization governments can begin to raise billions in corporate tax that are sorely needed and would otherwise be smuggled into European tax havens like the Netherlands. And this is a measure that Mark Rutte’s government claims to support – the southern European countries should make Mark Rutte’s government a condition of any package they agree with the misnamed ‘frugal four’.</data>

			<data>Solidarity from Irish writers with jailed Indian poet More than 100 international academics including Noam Chomsky have called on to release communist poet after he tested positive for coronavirus, AFP reports. Rao, 79, was swept up in police raids across their country in 2018 over links to Maoist militants and detained in a Mumbai prison, but never charged. Rao family claim that Rao health has severely deteriorated since Rao was jailed, and Rao tested positive for Covid-19 after Rao was moved to a hospital last week. The signatories - which include intellectual luminaries such as Barbara Harriss-White, Jan Breman and Amogh Sharma - also called for the release of 10 other Indian scholar-activists. “Conditions in the jails in which these prisoners of conscience have been kept are said to be unhealthy and the threat of spread of infection has grown,” said the open letter, dated Sunday. “We join other international scholars in appealing for the immediate release of Varavara Rao and the other. .. activists. ” Varavara Rao’s family on Monday called on authorities to brief them regularly on communist poet’s condition. “Varavara Rao family is not informed at all,” His family wrote in a statement. “Not sharing health updates of a person in judicial custody with His family is illegal, unconstitutional and inhuman. ” Maharashtra state, where Varavara Rao is being held, has emerged as the epicentre of India’s coronavirus outbreak with more than 300,000 confirmed infections. Jan Breman, Robin Jeffrey and 140 other international scholars call for the release of the ailing Varavara Roa and other Elgar Parishad activists.</data>

			<data>The Lancet has more on the Oxford vaccine tests: Compared to control group (given a meningitis vaccine), SARS-CoV-2 vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently, but some of these could be reduced by taking paracetamol. There were no serious adverse events from the vaccine T cell responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were markedly increased (in the 43 participants studied), peaking after 14 days. The T cell response did not increase with a 2nd dose of the vaccine, which is consistent with other vaccines of this kind the vaccine T cell responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were present in all participants who had a booster dose of the vaccine (9 of 9 participants in MNA80 assay at day 42, and 10 of 10 in Marburg VN assay on day 56) Authors say further clinical studies, including in older adults, should be done with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Current results focus on immune response measured in the laboratory. Further testing is needed to confirm if vaccine effectively protects against infection Oxford vaccine induces immune response Scientists at Oxford University say their experimental coronavirus has been shown to prompt a protective immune response in hundreds of people tested. British researchers first began testing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in April in about 1,000 people, half of whom got the experimental vaccine. Such early trials are usually designed only to evaluate safety, but in this case experts were also looking to see what kind of immune response was provoked. In research published Monday in the journal Lancet, scientists said that they found their experimental Covid-19 vaccine produced a dual immune response in people aged 18 to 55. vaccine is safe and induces an immune reaction, according to preliminary results “We are seeing good immune response in almost everybody,” said Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. “What SARS-CoV-2 vaccine does particularly well is trigger both arms of the immune system,” Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University said. Hill said that neutralising antibodies are produced molecules which are key to blocking infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine also causes a reaction in the body’s T-cells which help to fight off the coronavirus. Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University said that larger trials evaluating the vaccine’s effectiveness, involving about 10,000 people in the UK as well as participants in South Africa and Brazil are still underway. The Guardian and Kaiser Health News have identified reports of 821 frontline healthcare workers in the Covid-19 healthcare worker death toll: 735 deaths under investigation Trials of an experimental inhaled by patients have found a significant reduction in hospital patients with Covid-19 needing to be put on a ventilator or dying from the disease, according to researchers The drug, called SNG001, is delivered via an inhaler and is based on interferon-beta – a protein produced naturally in the body that plays an important role in coordinating the body’s antiviral response. Now researchers have announced the results of an initial trial, finding the odds that patients treated in hospital with Covid-19 will either go on to need ventilation, or die, were 79% better among those given SNG001, compared with those given a placebo.</data>

			<data>Trials of an experimental drug inhaled by patients have found a significant reduction in hospital patients with Covid-19 needing to be put on a ventilator or dying from the disease, according to researchers The drug, called SNG001, is delivered via an inhaler and is based on interferon beta, a protein produced naturally in the body that plays an important role in coordinating the body’s antiviral response. Researchers have announced the results of an initial trial which found the odds of Covid-19 patients needing ventilation, or dying, while being treated in hospital were reduced by 79% among those given SNG001 compared with those given a placebo. What is more, the team behind the trial say those given an experimental drug inhaled by patients were just over twice as likely to show “no limitation of activities” or “no clinical or virological evidence of infection” during the 16-day study period – in other words, the chance of recovery was boosted. those given an experimental drug inhaled by patients also showed a reduction in breathlessness. Tom Wilkinson, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Southampton and the trial’s chief investigator, said the results were promising. “the results are very positive and provide a strong platform to take an experimental drug inhaled by patients forward in clinical development, working closely with an international regulatory framework to try and get an experimental drug inhaled by patients into patient care as soon as is possible,” ’s chief investigator said, adding that an experimental drug inhaled by patients can be manufactured at scale. However some experts have urged caution. “the trial is too small to draw firm conclusions. The headline reduction in progression to severe disease comes with huge statistical uncertainty. It is good to see new treatments being developed and evaluated – but there is a big difference between encouraging early results and definitive evidence that transforms clinical practice,” said Martin Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Oxford. SNG001 is produced by the Southampton-based biotech firm Synairgen, a spin-out company from the University of Southampton, with University Hospital Southampton the lead centre for the trial, which involved nine UK hospitals.</data>

While half were given SNG001, the other half were given a placebo – neither the patients nor the doctors were aware at the time who was in which group. Patients were given the drug for up to 14 days, with post-treatment data collected on days 15 and 16, and patients further tracked up to day 28.

			<data>Injections of interferon beta are already used to help treat multiple sclerosis. However, SNG001 was formulated to allow the drug to be given via inhalation – an approach originally developed to treat other conditions including chronic-obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). But the University Hospital Southampton team realised the formulation might also bring benefits for Covid-19 patients: not only do patients with worse symptoms tend to be those with a deficiency of interferon beta, said Wilkinson, but it appears the coronavirus itself suppresses the body’s production of interferon beta. “A combination of those two effects, we think, has led to the severity of disease in certain populations, and hence why the drug might have a double, synergistic, effect – patching over the natural immune response and reducing the ability of the virus to subvert innate immunity,” said Wilkinson, adding that inhalation of interferon beta means the drug is delivered directly to the lungs, where the virus is replicating. the Southampton team is also conducting a trial of SNG001 in Covid-19 patients in the community who are at increased risk of severe disease. Wilkinson said the Southampton team were hopeful the drug could not only reduce the chance of such patients becoming gravely ill, but also speed up the Southampton team recovery, noting that even among mild cases of Covid-19, some people have reported symptoms that go on for months SNG001 is not the first drug to show promise in treating coronavirus patients: a cheap steroid called dexamethasone to reduce deaths in those requiring help with breathing, while the But Wilkinson said that while remdesivir was thought to be focused on coronaviruses, SNG001 has a more general effect, meaning SNG001 may also benefit patients with winter viruses such as flu. Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, welcomed the findings. “This is promising and interesting, adding to the positive news about use of dexamethasone,” he said.</data>

			<data>Republican senator Lindsey Graham voiced support for Trump’s efforts to send federal law enforcement agents to Democratic-led cities to crack down on protests against racism and police brutality. Republican senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, said in a tweet, “Trump is right to demand that law and order be restored in American cities. These protests and riots are getting out of hand, jeopardizing public safety and economic recovery. ” The South Carolina Republican added, “If federal law enforcement officials are necessary to do the job and Trump chooses to go down this path, I completely support Trump. ” If federal law enforcement officials are necessary to do the job and Trump chooses to go down this path, I completely support Trump. Republican senator Lindsey Graham’s comments come as activists in Portland, Oregon, express alarm over reports of federal agents using unmarked cars to detain peaceful protesters. The department of homeland security also reportedly plans to send 150 federal agents to Chicago. When Trump was asked this morning about how Trump plans to act against cities that have seen protests in recent weeks, Trump replied, “We’re going to have more federal law enforcement, that I can tell you. ” Here’s where the day stands so far: Trump said Trump would resume Trump coronavirus briefings, likely starting tomorrow. Trump held daily briefings at the start of the coronavirus crisis, but his coronavirus briefings attracted widespread criticism because of Trump frequent false and misleading claims about the pandemic. The department of homeland security reportedly intends to send 150 federal agents to Chicago. The report from the Chicago Tribune comes as activists in Portland, Oregon, have expressed severe alarm over incidents involving federal agents using unmarked cars to detain peaceful protesters. A coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University appears to be safe and prompts an immune response, raising hopes about the distribution of a vaccine in the coming months.

			<data>explained his decision to resume the White House coronavirus briefings by pointing to his “record” ratings from the briefings. “I was doing them, and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television, and there’s never been anything like it,” Trump said, according to the White House pool report. “it’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines and the therapeutics,” Trump added, even though Trump was frequently criticized for making false or misleading claims during the White House coronavirus briefings. Trump said the White House coronavirus briefings would “probably” start tomorrow. “I’ll do it at 5 o’clock like we were doing,” Trump said. “we had a good slot. A lot of people were watching. ” Trump to resume coronavirus briefings tomorrow told reporters Trump would resume the White House coronavirus briefings starting at 5 pm ET tomorrow. Trump says Trump is bringing back the White House coronavirus briefings Trump held daily White House briefings at the start of the coronavirus crisis, but Trump suspended them amid widespread criticism of the many false or misleading statements Trump made during the White House coronavirus briefings. Perhaps most famously, Trump suggested Americans could protect themselves from coronavirus by ingesting disinfectants, a false and dangerous claim that led public health officials to argued last week that resuming the White House coronavirus briefings could help Trump improve Trump falling polling numbers. “Trump had a 51% approval rating . .. when Trump was doing the White House coronavirus briefings,” Conway told Fox News. “They don’t need to be two hours long. ... But Trump can provide information to Americans because nobody does that quite like Trump. ” unexpectedly called reporters in to the Oval Office for an update on the discussions about Senate Trump said the discussions about Senate were going well, and treasury secretary added that Trump and White House chief of staff would brief Republicans on the talks tomorrow. “And then we will also be reaching out to the to begin the discussions about Senate,” Mnuchin said, according to the White House pool report. Mnuchin did not provide many specifics about the Republican bill, but Mnuchin said the administration wanted to ensure Americans do not make more money staying home than going to work, indicating Republicans are looking at curtailing additional unemployment benefits, which are set to expire at the end of this month. similarly said, “the administration don’t think any federal money should be spent [if] it gives you a disincentive to work; the administration want to make sure the administration have incentives to keep going. ” Democrats have called for continuing additional unemployment benefits, noting that tens of millions of Americans remain out of work because of the coronavirus crisis.</data>

			<data>“We’re never going to have our economy come back unless we recognize that we must put money in the pockets of the American people,” House speaker said earlier this month. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has released a statement criticizing the Republican bill as inadequate In a “Dear Colleague” letter to the Senate Democratic caucus, Schumer specifically questioned majority leader ’s decision to craft the Republican bill “behind the closed doors of the Oval Office. ” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is writing a COVID bill that will prioritize corporate special interests over workers and main street businesses, and will fail to adequately address the worsening spread of COVID. Workers and families and people—not special interests—must be our main focus. “This one-party approach to this legislation is the same approach that delayed the passage of the CARES Act and the subsequent interim emergency relief legislation, failed on policing reform, and it won’t work this time around either,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said. “Unfortunately, by all accounts the Senate Republicans are drafting legislation that comes up short in a number of vital areas, such as extending unemployment benefits or funding for rental assistance, hazard premium pay for frontline workers, or investments in communities of color being ravaged by the virus, and many other necessary provisions. Democrats will need to fight hard for these important provisions. ” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer closed a “Dear Colleague” letter to the Senate Democratic caucus by calling for a “a bipartisan, bicameral process” to draft a relief bill that can pass both chambers with widespread support, as the past coronavirus relief bills did.

			<data>Trump has repeatedly (and incorrectly) claimed that our country’s recent surge in coronavirus cases is due to the expansion of testing in many states. Trump bids to stop billions in track-and-trace funds as virus cases spike A coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University appears to be safe and prompts an immune response, lifting hopes about the possibly distribution of a vaccine in the coming months. Oxford University published the findings from Oxford University most recent trials of the vaccine in the medical journal the Lancet. A coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University reported no early safety concerns from the vaccine in the medical journal the Lancet and said Oxford University produced a strong immune response. “the vaccine in the medical journal the Lancet provoked a T cell response within 14 days of vaccination (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus), and an antibody response within 28 days (antibodies are able to neutralise the virus so that the virus cannot infect cells when initially contracted),” Oxford University said in the US government’s top infectious disease expert, has said he thinks the virus is likely a vaccine will be developed by early next year, but has suggested (without much basis) that a vaccine could be developed even faster.</data>

			<data>Today, through both analysis of internal records and interviews with dozens of EU officials and experts in both Brussels and the bloc’s capitals, the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism can tell the full story of how Europe emerged to be the of a global pandemic and what key lessons might be learned. It is a story of well-meaning officials in Brussels speaking in urgent tones of an impending disaster to empty press conference rooms. Of increasingly desperate health ministers unable to convince their heads of government and finance ministries of the scale of what was coming and the imperative to act. Of governments belatedly recognising the speed at which the virus was spreading, only to rush into uncoordinated acts of protectionism in moments of ill-concealed panic. And of EU institutions and agencies in which central figures either lacked the experience or powers to get capitals to act together in the face of a disease with respect for neither borders nor the glacial pace of Brussels’ bureaucracy. It is the story of EU caught ill-equipped and institutionally incapable of mounting an adequate response to the crisis that so swiftly engulfed EU. It was as millions of Europeans prepared for their New Year’s Eve celebrations that officials in the Stockholm office of the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), first received notice of a cluster of pneumonia cases in China of unknown origin. Just 12 of the 27 member states, plus the UK, phoned in to the 17 January conference call Established in 2005 in reaction to the Sars outbreak two years before, the ECDC offers scientific advice. It can do no more. Responsibility for health remains entirely with the national governments of the EU, and not in the European commission or its agencies. Despite European limitations, the ECDC’s job is to look to the full European horizon, and call the alarm whether capitals listen or not. the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) gave the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) first threat assessment on 9 January, the body’s director Dr Andrea Ammon recalled. “At that time, the notion [was] most of the cases were linked to this live animal market [in the Chinese city of Wuhan]”, the body’s director Dr Andrea Ammon told the Guardian. “Roughly two weeks later the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) turned out the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) is human to human transmission which of course changes what you need to do”. The initial concern was how to keep the disease outside the the EU’s borders. On 17 January a first coronavirus conference call was held by another the EU body born out of previous health crises – but again lacking the powers retained by the national governments. The European commission’s health security committee comprises health ministry representatives from each member state and has had responsibility for coordinating cross-border health threat responses in since the H1N1 influenza outbreak of 2009. But on 17 January, just 12 of the 27 member states, plus the UK, phoned in. Wolfgang Philipp, the head of a small team within the commission’s health department in Luxembourg, chaired the meeting. Wolfgang Philipp, the head of a small team within the commission’s health department in Luxembourg told those present that a few dozen people in Wuhan had been infected with a new strain of coronavirus.</data>

			<data>Two generations ago, Richard Nixon sweated his way to losing the ever presidential debate on television to a young, fit and cool John F Kennedy. US politics: coronavirus cases top 3. 75m as scientists appeal for Trump to listen – live updates It was the kind of rookie mistake you could put down to the newness of TV. So how do you explain – 60 years later – the drenching sweat that trickled down the face of the reality TV star who is now living inside the White House? Of the very few things is supposed to know in any modicum of detail, TV sits right at the tippity-top. There are more historic crises challenging his presidency than there are cable news channels, but that doesn’t stop him tweeting about all the TV he’s watching all day. For a man who still measures his manhood by his own TV ratings, it was a curious choice to sit outside in the humid steamer of a Washington summer, caked in his glowing orange make-up, to field the pesky questions of the best interviewer on Fox News. “Hot enough for you here, Mr President? ” “You know, we wanted to do it inside,” replied Wallace. “This is your choice. ” Trump has made so many more consequential blunders than failing to prepare for Trump double-sided grilling by the weather and Wallace. But this chargrilled interview laid bare how the Wicked Wizard of the West Wing is this chargrilled interview laid bare how the Wicked Wizard of the West Wing is melting before our eyes For four years we have been told that populist leaders – especially this one – are peerless showmen: experts not in government but in hijacking the public attention. his pithy nicknames and catchphrases supposedly destroyed his rivals in 2016. His pithy nicknames and catchphrases came up with 12-point plans while his was going to make America great again. his threatened North Korea with his big nuclear button, then fell in love with the North Korean leader in a summit staged just for the cameras. But now his repeated attempts to smear Joe Biden have flopped and the great showman is asking aides if his should try to find another nickname. With every new poll showing his losing the election, both nationally and in all the battleground states, Trump’s despair dribbled through all his pores on Sunday’s interview. When asked if Joe Biden was senile, Trump answered with the kind of half-baked half-thoughts of a mind cooking slowly in the heat of the presidency.</data>

There was that weird Mount Rushmore speech about the who say mean things about racists. Then again, as Chris Wallace pointed out, there are the polls that show this desperate act isn’t working. And there’s all the endless video of our sharp and tough president predicting the pandemic would just disappear, like a miracle, with a little disinfectant inside. Or perhaps some bright light. “I’ll be right eventually,” Trump insisted when confronted with his own cringe-inducing comments about the coronavirus. “I will be right eventually. You know I said, ‘the coronavirus’s going to disappear. ’ I’ll say the coronavirus again. ” They say a stopped clock is right twice a day. But this broken timepiece will only be happy when all the clocks have stopped. At this point in Trump’s Twilight Zone, the audience has a good sense of the plot twists that lie ahead in the next four months. the audience consists of as much concocted chaos as humanly possible. There will be terrorist protesters in every major city, whisked off the streets by Trump’s in rented minivans. Thank goodness we have machine-gun-toting goons to protect us from all that There will be caravans of coronavirus-filled immigrants scaling the border wall, which has done such a fantastic job of protecting us all from the pandemic.</data>

The UK has already ordered A vaccine would mark another feat of astonishing human brilliance. But expect the usual human bad behaviour too. Vaccine researchers pledge to make them available to all as cheaply as possible, but brace for nationalists everywhere to fight for their country first, just as Donald Trump plundered other countries’ personal protective equipment and tried to corner the market in remdesivir from the World Health Organization (WHO) to share all vaccine information, but few expect an orderly queue: calls for solidarity and cooperation risk being swept away by those with the sharpest elbows, deepest pockets and crookedest swindling. If the first successful vaccine turns out to be British, wait for the demand that every Briton gets it before the rest of the world, despite the fact that to end the pandemic scientists need to get it fastest to the places where the contagion is most rampant. But if the worst-affected nations are first in line this will include Brazil and the US, where presidents Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump bear personal responsibility for their countries’ high infections and death rates due to their Covid-19 denials and lockdown refusals. Donald Trump will seize the chance to boast Donald Trump got vaccines early to boost Donald Trump election campaign. If a British vaccine succeeds, wait for Boris Johnson’s cock-crows boasting of a world-beating triumph as it if were Donald Trump own invention, hoping to wipe clean memories of Donald Trump errors and the UK’s shameful death rate. Science must be blind to politics, plead the global vaccinators. A vaccine will be held up as an emblem of rational human scientific success, but be prepared for an explosion of human unreason.</data>

The Society of Homeopaths is under by the Professional Standards Authority, which regulates health professionals, as a member of its staff posted messages on social media calling vaccines “poison”, claiming homeopathy had a “great track record of success in epidemics” including Spanish and bird flu.

Cases of measles and mumps among teenagers rose after parents failed to vaccinate them as babies due to the Wakefield scare.

			<data>GP appointments are in short supply. The help young parents need is depleted or non-existent: the fall in vaccination rates is just another sign of neglect that has seen for the first time in my life. Britain’s Covid-19 experience has shown how bad policies and confused messaging from government can cause a large number of deaths, particularly in vulnerable groups. If a new vaccine works, if large batches are manufactured fast, will this government be capable of delivering vaccinations to everyone, after austerity has destroyed so much of the basic community health infrastructure? Herd immunity requires a high vaccination rate, but if one in six is refusing, it will take a herculean effort in persuasion to shift those deep fears. Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says: “Trust is key. But the UK has not done well and that will be a problem. ” Political polarisation is a danger: leavers tend to dismiss the danger presented by the virus, remainers are more obediently mask-wearing and cautious. “Compulsion can backfire. Reasoning with people is all there is,” says Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Mixed, muddled, contradictory advice has spread confusion and an increasingly petulant resistance. Senior doctors are pleading with the public to keep to the social distancing rules for fear the Rightwingers, ever eager to make a culture war out of anything, are losing their absurd mask wars: shows that seven out of 10 support mandatory mask-wearing in English shops, with only 13% opposed. the public is more cautious than Johnson: the public know the public’s not over, lifting lockdown has not led to a spike in cases , but local and national lockdowns remain a risk. Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response, trial shows On Monday Oxford coronavirus was at a school, oddly emphasising that: “We’ve got to continue with our current approach, maintaining social distancing measures … washing hands … wearing face masks in confined spaces like on public transport or in shops.</data>

			<data>Severe flooding in India’s tea-growing state of Assam and neighbouring has killed at least 200 people and displaced millions, severely hampering efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. In Assam, heavy monsoon rains burst the banks of the Brahmaputra River, causing more than 2,000 villages to be enveloped in floods and mudslides and displacing 2. 75 million people in the past two weeks. There have been 85 deaths reported in the state. Keshab Mahanta, Assam’s water resources minister, said: “The flood situation remains critical with most of the rivers flowing menacingly above the danger mark. ” Officials voiced concern that the flooding and hurried evacuation of millions of Assam residents would cause a significant rise in cases of coronavirus in the north-eastern state, known for its tea plantations. At the moment, 50,000 people are sheltered in cramped relief camps but because of the scale and urgency of the evacuations, officials admitted that no physical distancing measures were being enforced. Sanghamitra Sanyal, a member of Assam’s flood management force, told Reuters: “It’s hard to enforce social distancing when people are being ordered to move away from the rising waters. “We’re urging people to at least cover their mouth and nose with a piece of clean cloth. ” The number of Covid-19 cases is still increasing rapidly in Assam, with more than 1,000 new infections reported daily, pushing the state’s total to almost 25,000 cases. Last week the total cases in surpassed a million, making it the third worst affected country in the world. Officials from the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) urged authorities to deal with complaints that mismanaged and contaminated coronavirus waste, including used masks and other personal protective equipment, was washing up in the floodwaters in areas of Guwahati, the largest city in Assam.</data>

But Trump also said Trump might veto the next stimulus package designed to help unemployed Americans and small business if it did not include a payroll tax cut. As that would dramatically affect social security and other vital programs, it is seen by most in Congress as a political non-starter.

Host Chris Wallace pointed out that was not true , leading to an angry exchange. Host Chris Wallace also asked why the US did not have “a national plan” for tackling the pandemic and if Trump took responsibility for that. “Look,” the president said, “I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job, too. I have to get everybody in line. ” I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job, too. I have to get everybody in line That contrasted with an infamous remark made at a press conference in March, “I don’t take responsibility at all” for problems with federal testing.

Measures announced on Sunday for the Tianshan district of Urumqi included mass health screenings, and some public transport and most flights into the city of Urumqi were stopped on Saturday. Group activities have been suspended and people were warned against unnecessary travel outside the city of Urumqi.</data>

			<data>With everything that’s happened with the Black Lives Matter movement, I’ve wanted to try and get a fuller picture, so I’ve been listening to podcasts such as , which I’ve just started. The latter won a Pulitzer prize, so I know it will be great, but I have to be in the mood to listen to it, because it’s about slavery – it’s a lot. My name is Renay Richardson, I am clearly descended from slaves and my family is from the Caribbean. You have to be in a certain frame of mind to listen to something like that. On a lighter note, I’m a fan of music shows such as – I just found out there’s a Lauryn Hill series that I’ve not listened to. I used to love watching things such as Making the Band and Making the Video on MTV, so it’s my kind of thing. it’s difficult with music and podcasts, though, because of the rights and clearance issues. But I think you need the music in there to get the whole experience. ‘We agreed that The podcast was going to be a space of joy during coronavirus’ . .. Tolly T, co-host of The Receipts. I was really worried about making fluffy content over lockdown when there’s so much stress in the world right now, but then I thought: no, people need it. I spoke with [her co-hosts] Audrey [Indome] and Milena [Sanchez], and We agreed that The podcast was going to be a space of joy, though obviously there are conversations that needed to be had. There was no way on earth We could do a podcast and not mention , for example, with two of the hosts being black women. It has been tough to make the show sometimes; every time I’ve recorded, the local ice-cream van has come out. I’ve been like: ‘Why are you doing this? !’ But We’ve managed to make the show work. I produce The podcast, too, and I feel The podcast has improved my skills, because I’ve had to be a bit more techy to improve the quality of the audio. Since Serial, I’ve been a massive podcast fan.</data>

With few opportunities in Mexico, the couple had found jobs under a federal program for seasonal farm workers, and planned to send money home to their family. Canada: three killed in glacier tour bus crash in Alberta After working on other farms, they transferred to Bylands, a plant nursery in the small city of Kelowna, British Columbia, which had gone through a Covid-19 outbreak that ended on 11 May. When Canada: three killed in glacier tour bus crash in Alberta started work on 27 May, managers told Canada: three killed in glacier tour bus crash in Alberta the farm had a strict policy to prevent spread of the virus: migrant workers couldn’t leave the farm or have visitors. The rule did not apply to Canadian workers. Government guidelines order workers to isolate for 14 days when they first arrive in , but by then,the virusle had been in the country for months. The local health authority had issued an order restricting movement of Bylands workers, but it had been lifted by the time the couple arrived. On 28 June, Molina and Zavala invited two migrant rights activists to their employer-provided house, but another worker took a photo and sent it to their boss. The manager called two migrant rights activists into his office, showed two migrant rights activists a photo, and fired two migrant rights activists. The manager asked two migrant rights activists to sign a letter stating two migrant rights activists had broken the rules by leaving the property and interacting with people who did not work there. “As a result, you are sent home immediately,” a letter stating they had broken the rules by leaving the property and interacting with people who did not work there says in Spanish. two migrant rights activists asked for a second chance, but The manager decision was final. Zavala said Zavala felt Zavala had no choice but to sign. The manager wouldn’t touch the pen Zavala used, as if Zavala were sick, Zavala said.

Since launching on 6 July, the Covid Tracker app was downloaded 1. 3m times in eight days – the fastest-downloaded app per capita in Europe – and has started picking up cases of infection. “We’ve been delighted by the take-up rate. It’s gone beyond the initial hopes,” said Colm Harte, the technical director of , the company that made the app for the Health Service Executive (HSE). the Covid Tracker app uses a phone’s signal to exchange a digital handshake with another device also running the Covid Tracker app when users come within 2 metres of each other for more than 15 minutes.</data>

			<data>NearForm made a similar app for Gibraltar, which launched last month, and one for Northern , due to launch within weeks. “NearForm’s the same core platform. NearForm’s built on the Irish solution,” said Harte. “An Irish solution to an Irish problem” is a derisive term in Ireland for attempted fixes that are daft or quixotic. In this case, though, there seems no need for self-deprecation. Ireland has made a tool against the pandemic not only for Ireland but for part of the UK and for a British overseas territory – while Britain flounders in its own attempt to The NHS Covid-19 app was meant to roll out in England in May. That slipped to June. Last month, officials ditched The NHS Covid-19 app in The NHS Covid-19 app original form and backed an alternative designed by Apple and Google. The government said it The Irish are not crowing. Authorities originally hoped to launch The NHS Covid-19 app in March, only to encounter complications. And The Irish effectiveness remains unclear. “The Irish still has to prove The Irish mettle,” said L’Estrange. Even so, the take-up rate is impressive, said L’Estrange. “What that shows is the credibility of The NHS Covid-19 app, the confidence in the initiative, and the enthusiasm for participating in the collective project to contain the virus. ” The €850,000 (£773,000) price tag is “dirt cheap” given that the average cost of identifying each case of infection is €42,000, said L’Estrange. “Even if it fails to produce the goods, little has been lost. ” This suggests Ireland’s health system, plagued in normal times by bloated management, turf battles and duplication, can do well in a crisis. “The whole of the organisation attuned itself and focused on coronavirus,” said Fran Thompson, a HSE spokesperson. The pandemic allowed HSE to shortcut the regular tender process and select NearForm in mid-March. “HSE probably saved six to eight weeks,” said Thompson.</data>

			<data>The UK government is investing millions to secure two more experimental vaccines against Covid-19, increasing the chances of obtaining a vaccine that works for the population. The agreement is to buy 90m doses of two vaccines, which would be enough to immunise frontline health workers and care staff, who will be the priority. The UK government is effectively hedging The UK government bets – the two vaccines work in a different way from the Oxford vaccine, of which The UK government has already bought 100m doses. The UK government is also urging the public to sign up to take part in trials of Covid-19 vaccines, in the hope of having 500,000 people registered as willing to take part by October. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, said the UK had signed a deal to buy 30m doses of the mRNA vaccine being developed by the German company BioNTech with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. The companies recently announced positive results from phase 1 trials, which show it is safe and produces an immune response – although with some side-effects at higher doses. the mRNA vaccine being developed by the German company BioNTech with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer is being developed by the French company Valneva, which unlike Oxford and BioNTech has not been viewed as one of the early frontrunners in vaccine research. The agreement is to buy 60m doses – in principle. If the mRNA vaccine being developed by the German company BioNTech with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer is proven to be safe, effective and suitable, the UK has secured an option to acquire a further 40m doses. “The hunt to find a vaccine is a truly global endeavour and we are doing everything we can to ensure the British public get access to a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible,” said Sharma. “This new partnership with some of the world’s foremost pharmaceutical and vaccine companies will ensure the UK has the best chance possible of securing a vaccine that protects those most at risk. ” Effectively three different approaches to making a vaccine are now covered. the mRNA vaccine being developed by the German company BioNTech with the phaOxfordtical company Pfizer is an adenoviral vaccine. More data on the early trials of an adenOxford vaccine is expected later on Monday and is likely to be promising. The BioNTech/Pfizer candidate is an mRNA vaccine – as is the vaccine being developed by Imperial, which has received research funding from the UK government and entered human trials last month.</data>

			<data>the UK government will contribute to the costs of Valneva’s UK clinical trials and is negotiating funding to expand its factory, creating more jobs and boosting the local economy, the UK government says. the UK government has launched a register for people who are willing to take part in the vaccine trials and is urging them to sign up. “A safe and effective vaccine is our best hope of defeating coronavirus and returning to life as normal,” said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. “We have some of our best scientists and researchers working on this, but members of the public have a vital role to play too. So I urge everyone who can to back the national effort and sign up to the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to help find a vaccine as soon as possible. “Every volunteer will be doing their bit towards finding a vaccine for Covid-19 that will have the potential to save millions of lives around the world and bring this pandemic to an end. ” Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said: “Thanks to Covid-19 patients’ willingness to take part in treatment studies, we’ve been able to identify treatments that work and ones that don’t, which has improved patient care world-wide. “Now that there are several promising vaccines on the horizon, we need to call again on the generosity of the public to help find out which potential vaccines are the most effective. Using a new NHS website developed in partnership between the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and NHS Digital, people across the UK can register their interest to be approached to join a vaccine study. Please go to the website and consider volunteering. ” How would a coronavirus vaccine work and will we even get one?</data>

These are external links and will open in a new window What if there was a way of returning life to what it was like before Coronavirus? No more social distancing, no face coverings, no fear of Covid-19. Of course the reason for all the restrictions is an attempt to bear down on the virus, and to minimise its spread. What we need is a fast and reliable way of spotting those around us who are infected. The first problem is that fewer than one in four people testing positive for coronavirus have symptoms on the day they get tested. That highlights the risk of the virus being spread by people who aren&apos;t aware they are infected.</data>

			<data>It&apos;s all over in a couple of seconds, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d want to have it done every week, as has been proposed for NHS front-line staff A third problem is time. The swab, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has to be sent to a lab and takes a few hours to process. Nine out of 10 people who attend one of the drive-in centres get their result back within 24 hours. But it&apos;s not yet a while-you-wait service. So what we need is a rapid, easy and reliable test for coronavirus. Some fast-turnaround swab tests are being trialled, which would be a big step forward. saliva tests could be a real gamechanger Imagine if all you had to do was spit into a tube to find out if you have coronavirus. OK, it&apos;s not quite as simple as that. The saliva sample has to be sent to a laboratory, but the result can be turned around far quicker than a swab test. Jayne Lees and her family are part of a four-week trial of saliva tests under way in Southampton.</data>

			<data>More than 10,000 GP and other key workers and their families in Southampton are involved in the project. &quot;We think saliva is a really important fluid to test,&quot; says Keith Godfrey at the University of Southampton, who is helping to co-ordinate the trial &quot;The salivary glands are the first place in the body that the virus infects. It seems people become positive in their saliva before the rest of their breathing tubes. &quot;If we are seeking to pick up people in the early course of the infection, this may be the way forwards. &quot; The success of the trial depends on how accurate the saliva test is at detecting coronavirus. The samples from the Southampton study are being processed at the Animal and Plant Health Agency government laboratories in Surrey. The samples from the Southampton study are added to a solution and heated to release the genetic material of the virus. The method, known as RT-Lamp, takes around 20 minutes, compared to several hours for PCR testing. &quot;We are very excited,&quot; says Prof Ian Brown, head of virology. &quot;We had some major breakthroughs in the past few weeks, in terms of overcoming technical challenges in being able to use the saliva test. &quot; This is where things get interesting. If the trial goes well, the entire city of Southampton, more than 250,000 people, could be offered weekly saliva tests. &quot;If we&apos;re looking to reopen society and the economy, this may be a way of monitoring the presence of the virus in communities and picking up outbreaks before lockdowns are needed,&quot; says Prof Godfrey. The whole of the UK could be offered weekly spit tests Some would like things to go even further. A group of scientists led by Prof Julian Peto of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the entire population of the UK should be offered weekly spit tests A group of scientists led by Prof Julian Peto of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine argue that the Covid-19 epidemic could be &quot;ended and normal life restored&quot; if mass surveillance was carried out.

			<data>Currently the government says it can carry out 300,000 tests a day, but that would need to rise to 10 million a day. The way it would work is this: you do your spit test and send it off. Within 24 hours you get a text with the result. If it&apos;s positive then you and your family have to self-isolate. Restaurants and other public venues could ask for evidence of a recent negative test before allowing people entry. The hope is that early identification of those infected would rapidly bring the Covid-19 epidemic to a halt. Of course it would be expensive, perhaps £1bn per month. But that is a tiny fraction of the impact of coronavirus on the economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggests the crisis is likely to cost more than £300bn in this financial year, and perhaps even more. Compliance would be an issue. How many of us would be prepared to spit in a tube every week? It would be a faff. But if the flip side was that all social distancing could be ended, wouldn&apos;t you jump at the chance?</data>

			<data>I&apos;ve been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic, and yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Sadly, us may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. What does Covid-19 do to the brain? How breakthrough coronavirus drug dexamethasone was found Was coronavirus here earlier than us thought? &apos;I was gobsmacked to test positive for coronavirus antibodies&apos; If breakthrough coronavirus drug dexamethasone worked it would mean an end to face masks and one-way systems in shops, an end to isolation for millions of elderly and vulnerable people. You could hug your friends and grandparents again. Something less ambitious but more targeted could also have a major impact. Schools could test pupils and staff on a weekly basis. Regular spit tests could also be performed in care homes or in hot spot areas. Labs could be set up in airports, so that arriving or departing passengers could be tested while they waited. A lot is riding on the Southampton trial. One issue which may complicate things is that the incidence of coronavirus in Southampton has been falling. Jayne Lees and her family have twice tested negative so far. I suspect the same applies to all, or nearly everyone else taking part. In order for the study to work, it needs to be able to identify positive samples as well as negatives. But Jayne&apos;s children are among those hoping such hurdles will be overcome and mass saliva testing becomes the solution. &quot;It would be great, we could get the pandemic over and done with,&quot; says Sam, 19. &quot;It would change people&apos;s lives. &quot; What are the rules now?

These are external links and will open in a new window People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. In England it is compulsory to wear one on public transport and from 24 July it will also be compulsory in shops. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here&apos;s our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you&apos;re handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably.</data>

If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Should I be wearing one? Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes.

Southampton-based biotech Synairgen said the clinical trial also indicated &quot;very significant&quot; reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days.

But if the preliminary results of the trial are as the company says, it will be a very important step forward in the treatment of coronavirus infections. The scientist in charge of the clinical trial, Tom Wilkinson, says if the preliminary results of the trial are confirmed in larger studies the new treatment will be &quot;a game changer&quot;. the clinical trial was relatively small but the signal that the treatment benefits patients was unusually strong, The scientist in charge of the trial, Tom Wilkinson says. &quot;We couldn&apos;t have expected much better results than these,&quot; Southampton-based biotech Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden told the BBC. Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden described the preliminary results of the trial as &quot;a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients&quot;.</data>

			<data>How was the treatment tested? No-one involved in the trial knew which patients have been given which treatment until it was over. &quot;If you know it&apos;s a drug, your mind might have a bias,&quot; explained Sandy Aitken, one of the nurses who administered The new drug to patients at Southampton Hospital. Synairgen&apos;s drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19. The Synairgen team believes The new drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection. A trial exploring the effects of giving patients who are in high-risk groups The new drug as soon as The new drug are confirmed as having Covid-19 has struggled to find volunteers because there are so few new infections at the moment. What do other experts say? Expert in emergency medicine Prof Steve Goodacre, from the University of Sheffield, said: &quot;These results are not interpretable. We need the full details and, perhaps more importantly, the trial protocol. Synairgen&apos;s drug trial should have been registered and a protocol made available before any analysis was undertaken. &quot; Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: &quot;The results seem very impressive, and although accepted that Synairgen&apos;s drug trial is small with just over 100 participants, a 79% reduction in disease severity could be a game changer. &quot;It would be good to see the full results once presented and peer-reviewed to make sure they are robust and the trial conduct was rigorous. Also, with small numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics. Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, the full results are very exciting. &quot; What are the rules now? How many cases in your area?</data>

			<data>Coronavirus: How did Florida get so badly hit by Covid-19? These are external links and will open in a new window Read more about sharing. These are external links and will open in a new window Florida is fast becoming America&apos;s latest Covid-19 epicentre. The surge in the Sunshine State has been linked in part to younger Americans - but that doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s no cause for concern. Like many Covid-19 stories, no cause for concern started with a dry cough. Fever, loss of taste and chest pain followed Sanjay Bharath&apos;s diagnosis in early March. Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida, says he caught the virus from a patient when the Covid-19 screening process for admissions was less strict. Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida was told to self-quarantine two days later. At 34 years old, Sanjay Bharath&apos;s does not fall into a virus-vulnerable age group. But 14 days after that first contact, Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida had coughed up blood and checked into the hospital. &quot;I didn&apos;t think it was too bad,&quot; Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida says, describing Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida first couple of hours in the ER. &quot;I honestly thought they weren&apos;t going to admit me at the hospital, just send me home with some sort of medication. &quot; As Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida symptoms worsened, Sanjay Bharath&apos;s says Sanjay Bharath&apos;s would wake up in a fever-sweat every six hours, feeling chills and lightheaded and unable to catch Sanjay Bharath&apos;s breath. Sanjay Bharath, a 34-year-old nurse, was hospitalised over the virus &quot;I couldn&apos;t take a big breath without coughing and choking,&quot; Sanjay Bharath&apos;s says. &quot;It&apos;s like you&apos;re running a marathon constantly just by sitting down. &quot;</data>

			<data>Sanjay Bharath&apos;s would remain on a ventilator for eight days. Florida has been averaging nearly 10,000 new cases per day for the last week. On 12 July, Florida broke the national record by reporting 15,300 cases in a single day. on 12 July found if Florida were a country, it would be fourth in the world for most new cases in a day. As of 14 July, over 4,400 Floridians have died due to the virus and Florida&apos;s weekly average has risen to 81 people each day by local counts. The same day saw Florida&apos;s all-time highest daily death toll, with 132 reported deaths. Florida saw the biggest daily jump in hospital admissions on 9 July, with more than 400 patients needing treatment, as well as 120 residents, including an 11-year-old girl, dying due to the virus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? Critics say the number of deaths is probably higher, as Florida does not like other states report deaths suspected as having been caused by Covid-19. Florida also has yet to report daily hospital admission rates, though officials have promised to do so. Along with Texas and Arizona, Florida has fast become one of the regions with the highest surges in a country. Media playback is unsupported on your device Cases spike as nightlife returns in Arizona The positive test rate - which indicates how much the virus is spreading even with testing increases - is nearing 20%, the highest since early March when the pandemic hit the US. That&apos;s also four times the standard for reopening set by the World Health Organization, and double the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control. Florida only hit the 100,000 case mark on 22 June, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Just 13 days later, that number had doubled. Now, there are more than 287,000 cases. Florida&apos;s Disney World resort reopened with limited capacity on 11 July &quot;There&apos;s a lot of misinformation all over the web about the seriousness of this outbreak,&quot; says Dr Aileen Marty, a Florida International University infectious disease expert who has been working with state officials on the pandemic response.</data>

			<data>Mr Bharath was one of the first staff in his hospital to catch Covid-19, back in March. After being taken off the ventilator, the 34-year-old was moved from the ICU to recover for four days in a Covid-19-only unit - the same unit where Mr Bharath works now. No visitors were allowed in at all, even family. &quot;The recovery was a little difficult at first,&quot; Mr Bharath says. &quot;I was still really out of breath, I still had some pneumonia. It was still difficult breathing and moving around. &quot; In the two weeks in hospital over Covid-19, Mr Bharath lost 20 lbs (9kg). Lying still in a hospital bed exacerbated a prior nerve issue in Mr Bharath feet - Mr Bharath lost some feeling in Mr Bharath toes while other tendons had stiffened up painfully. Mr Bharath was out of work for another six weeks. Now, four months since Mr Bharhis hospital stay, Mr Bharath is still recovering. &quot;I still get short of breath a bit here and there,&quot; Mr Bharath says. When Mr Bharath returned to work at the start of June, Mr Bharath says Mr Bharath &quot;hesitated a little bit&quot;. &quot;But I felt like I owed the staff and the employees, and there&apos;s still a job to be done, so I had to go back. &quot; Why so many US nurses are out of work An invisible wound for health workers and soldiers The never-ending work is beginning to take a toll on healthcare workers across the state. Staff are exhausted, frustrated, scared. As of 13 July, there are just over 13,700 hospital beds - about 22% of the total - still available in the state, according to data from the Agency for Health Care Administration. Nearly half of all the ICUs in the state report being at least 90% full, leaving under 1,200 beds available. Over 40 hospitals are already at capacity.</data>
